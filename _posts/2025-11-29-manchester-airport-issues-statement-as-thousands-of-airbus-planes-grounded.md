Manchester Airport has announced that a software update for some Airbus A320 aircraft could lead to 'limited' travel disruptions this weekend. This comes after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a precautionary instruction impacting around 6,000 planes. UK airlines most affected include Wizz Air, EasyJet, and Jet2. Wizz Air has completed the necessary updates without further issues, while EasyJet may have schedule changes and will keep passengers updated via email or SMS. Jet2 is only updating a few aircraft and expects no impact on its flight schedules. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander reassured that any disruptions should be minimal and commended the swift response from airline staff to ensure passenger safety. Manchester Airport operations remain smooth, and passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight info.
