There's a right kerfuffle in Bickershaw, Wigan, over a massive illegal waste tip with about 25,000 tonnes of rubbish and a history of fires. The land, partly owned by Wigan Council and the King’s Duchy of Lancaster, has stirred debate on who’s responsible for the clean-up. The Duchy claims it’s exempt from liability due to an old law but faces mounting pressure from local MP Josh Simons for a fair contribution. Wigan Council's strapped for cash, and residents are at their wits’ end with rats and foul smells invading their homes. There's a push for collaboration among all parties involved, including the Environment Agency, which is on the case and investigating the dumpers. Meanwhile, locals just want this mess sorted so they can live peacefully again.
