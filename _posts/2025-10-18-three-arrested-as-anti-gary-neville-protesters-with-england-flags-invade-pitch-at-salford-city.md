Three people were arrested for a pitch invasion during Salford City's match against Oldham Athletic. Two individuals in white hoodies that read "Gary Neville is a Traitor" ran onto the field, waving England flags, prompting a halt in the match as security ushered them off. The incident caught attention because Neville, a co-owner of Salford City, recently completed a takeover involving David Beckham. Amid cheers from some fans and chants derogatory towards Neville, the far-right group Britain First claimed responsibility, framing it as a protest against Neville's stance on a British flag he removed from one of his developments, which he felt was being displayed negatively. In a recent comment, Neville explained his actions, addressing divisions caused by "angry, middle-aged white men" and highlighting his love for the country while questioning the motivations behind the flagâ€™s display during divisive times.
