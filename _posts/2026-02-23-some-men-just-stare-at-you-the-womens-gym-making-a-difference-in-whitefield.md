Many women feel intimidated in mixed gym settings, often facing unwanted attention or harassment. Surveys reveal over 60% of women experience this discomfort, leading to a rise in women-only fitness centres. One notable example is the Total Fitness gym in Whitefield, which rapidly filled its capacity since opening. Clients like Jess Griffiths and Nazia Maqsood appreciate the welcoming atmosphere where women can connect without feeling judged or overwhelmed by male presence. Griffiths, who has made local friends through the gym, emphasises the supportive environment, while Maqsood, facing cultural stereotypes, values the diverse community. The gym also offers a space for women to discuss shared experiences, especially regarding life changes like menopause. Louise Parkinson echoes this sense of community, noting it provides her mental clarity away from motherhood. Despite some criticism surrounding women-only gyms, including extra membership fees and debates on whether they’re a long-term solution to harassment, participants like Maqsood advocate for these spaces, highlighting the importance of having a safe fitness environment.
