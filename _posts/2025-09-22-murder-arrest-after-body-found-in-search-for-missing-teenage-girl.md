A murder arrest has been made following the tragic death of a teenage girl in Tameside. Catherine, 17, was reported missing from Ashton-under-Lyne early on September 20 and was last seen around 2.20am. Police found a girl deceased at a property on Whalley Close the next day, and although formal identification is pending, they believe it to be Catherine. A 55-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder but the cause of death is still unclear. Greater Manchester Police are asking for anyone with information or footage from the area during that time to come forward. Detective Chief Inspector Anna Barker expressed condolences to the family and reassured the public that the investigation is ongoing. For those who have tips, theyâ€™re encouraged to contact the police or reach out anonymously via Crimestoppers.
