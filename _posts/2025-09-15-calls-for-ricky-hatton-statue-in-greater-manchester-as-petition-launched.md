A petition has been initiated to create a statue in honour of Ricky 'The Hitman' Hatton following his recent passing at 46. The former champion boxer, found dead at his home in Hyde, Tameside, received an outpouring of tributes worldwide. Greater Manchester Police confirmed no foul play was involved. The petition, led by fan Mathew Lord, is aimed at Hyde Town Council, suggesting the town centre as a possible location, with support also expected from Tameside Council. Mayor Andy Burnham expressed the city's commitment to honouring Hatton properly, acknowledging his profound impact on the community and his charitable contributions. Celebrated for his grit and goodwill, Hatton was not just a sportsman but a local hero who inspired many. The petition reflects the desire to solidify his legacy, reminding everyone of his achievements and character. Hatton's iconic victory over Kostya Tszyu in 2005 remains a highlight of his career. The petition is gaining traction as fans rally to commemorate this cherished figure from Greater Manchester.
