In Manchester city centre, witnesses were left shocked when part of Alberton House, scheduled for demolition, collapsed, causing scaffolding to crash into the River Irwell. Many initially thought it was an earthquake due to a strong tremor felt nearby. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated, and around 500 people, including workers from a nearby business centre, were sent home out of safety concerns. George Jones, owner of Cardinal House next door, explained that they were unaware of any safety risks before the incident. After the collapse, the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service responded quickly, but fortunately, there were no reported injuries. The fire service has since left the scene.
