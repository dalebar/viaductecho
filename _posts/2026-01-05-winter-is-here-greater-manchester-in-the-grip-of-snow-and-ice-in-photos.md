Greater Manchester is all frosted up this morning, with sub-zero temperatures making it feel quite wintry. There's a Met Office yellow weather warning in place until noon, but the bright winter sunshine adds a nice charm to the icy scenes. Our photographers have been snapping some lovely shots, and locals have been sharing their views as well. From Monton to Royton and Stockport, it's a snowy spectacle everywhere you look! Just remember to bundle up and enjoy the festive vibes while staying warm!
