A brand new ice rink is opening this Christmas at McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Cheshire Oaks near Manchester, enhancing its popular Winter Village. The festive event features the returning 'Santa in the Sky' big wheel, alongside the stunning ice rink that winds around a historic oak tree, creating a vibrant festive atmosphere. The rink, made of real ice, will be a hub for holiday activities, including pre-bookable 'magical Christmas huts' that can accommodate up to six people for a minimum spend. Guests can enjoy traditional German food, mulled wine, and catch classic Christmas films in the Alpine Lodge on select dates. Opening on October 24, tickets will range from £9.50 to £15, and families of four can skate for £36 off-peak. General manager Kenny Murray shared excitement for this unique experience, aimed at fostering festive memories for families and friends.
