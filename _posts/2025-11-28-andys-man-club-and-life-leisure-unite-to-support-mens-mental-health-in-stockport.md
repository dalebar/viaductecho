Life Leisure's Stockport Sports Village has launched Stockport's only Andy's Man Club, providing a supportive space for men to discuss mental health openly, especially during Men's Health Month. Andy's Man Club is a national charity that runs free peer-to-peer support groups aimed at reducing the stigma around men’s mental health. With over 320 groups across the UK, it's a lifeline for many men. The initiative is particularly poignant following the loss of local sports icon Ricky Hatton, highlighting the importance of mental health conversations. Jess Brown, a Mental Health First Aider, emphasises the significance of opening up, noting that it can truly save lives. The Stockport group meets every Monday at 7:00 PM, no booking required—just turn up and take a seat. This collaboration by Life Leisure underscores their commitment to mental wellbeing and building community connections.
