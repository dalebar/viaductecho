A busy stretch of road was closed near Droylsden town centre in Greater Manchester due to a collision at the junction of Market Street and Medlock Street this afternoon (December 21). Emergency services responded swiftly, causing heavy traffic delays on Market Street, Ashton Road, and Greenside Lane. Witnesses reported a significant presence of emergency responders and were turned away from the scene by Greater Manchester Police. The road has since reopened, but further details about the incident are still pending as updates are awaited from emergency services.
