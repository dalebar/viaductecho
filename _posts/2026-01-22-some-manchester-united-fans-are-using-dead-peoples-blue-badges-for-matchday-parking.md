Trafford Council is addressing misuse of Blue Badges by Manchester United fans on matchdays. Fans have been spotted using badges belonging to deceased individuals, expired ones, and those reported lost. Blue Badges enable holders to park in designated spaces and enjoy certain parking privileges. To combat this, the council will increase inspections around Old Trafford and impose £70 fines for rule-breakers. This crackdown aims to tackle illegal parking that has led to blocked emergency routes, congestion, and disruption for residents. Stephen Adshead from Trafford Council emphasised the importance of keeping roads safe for everyone and ensuring that Blue Badge parking is accessible for those who genuinely need it.
