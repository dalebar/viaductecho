A couple of lads were spotted hanging onto the back of a Bee Network bus near the Trafford Centre last Sunday, and the footage went viral on social media. It captured two boys, in black coats, climbing onto the bus as it made its way down Redclyffe Road. A witness reported they clung on for quite a while, while another bus honked at them. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) condemned the dangerous antics, stressing it not only puts lives at risk but also constitutes a criminal offence. They’ve urged parents and guardians to have a chat with their kids about the serious dangers involved. Overall, it’s been a stark reminder of how risky such behaviour can be.
