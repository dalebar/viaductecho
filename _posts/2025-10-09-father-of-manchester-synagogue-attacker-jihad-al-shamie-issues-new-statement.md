Faraj al-Shamie, the father of the Manchester synagogue attacker, has expressed his gratitude for the support his family has received following the tragic event. Last week, Jihad Al-Shamie drove into worshippers and attacked them with knives at the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue, resulting in two fatalities and several injuries before he was shot by police. In a heartfelt Facebook statement, Faraj condemned the attack and emphasised the need for unity, compassion, and vigilance to prevent such violence in the future. He praised Manchester as a city of multicultural harmony where various faiths co-exist peacefully. The family, who has lived in the UK for years, called for respect for their privacy and urged the media to accurately represent their feelings regarding the incident. Prior to this statement, he had publicly denounced the attack and expressed sorrow for the victims and their families. Jihad was granted British citizenship in 2006 and had a complicated personal history, including multiple marriages.
