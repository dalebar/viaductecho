Counter-terror police in Manchester have shared updates on the recent attack at Heaton Park synagogue. The assailant, Jihad Al-Shamie, called 999 during the attack, pledging allegiance to Islamic State. He was shot dead by police, but not before fatally injuring two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz. Six people were arrested in connection with the incident, though two have since been released without charge, with the others set for similar treatment. 

Police explained that Al-Shamie, who had not been previously known to authorities, was armed with two knives and wearing a non-viable hoax device. Witnesses noted suspicious behaviour from him prior to the attack, where he drove into crowds outside the synagogue before assaulting individuals. Three others remain in hospital with serious injuries. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts emphasised the ongoing investigation, thanking the community for their support and urging anyone with information to step forward.
