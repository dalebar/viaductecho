Greater Manchester's emergency departments are facing unprecedented demand, with some patients reportedly waiting over 50 hours for a bed, particularly at Royal Oldham Hospital. While the Northern Care Alliance maintains that wait times are within normal ranges, staff have confirmed some lengthy delays. The increase in demand is linked to flu and other winter viruses, leading to a rise in patients needing urgent care. The government has pledged to end corridor care by 2029 amidst a crisis highlighted by the Royal College of Nursing, which cites a dramatic spike in patients waiting over 12 hours. With bed occupancy exceeding 90%, NHS leaders are urging the public to seek alternative services, like NHS 111, for less urgent needs. Local NHS trusts are battling historical underfunding and resource shortages, particularly in areas like Oldham. Health secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the urgent conditions faced by both staff and patients and stressed the need for more resources. Community members are encouraged to use local healthcare services and vaccinations to alleviate pressure on the NHS this winter.
