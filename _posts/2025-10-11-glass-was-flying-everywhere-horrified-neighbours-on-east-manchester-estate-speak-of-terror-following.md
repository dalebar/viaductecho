Neighbours in east Manchester are shaken after a chaotic street fight involving machetes and knives unfolded on Wayland Road, resulting in a 17-year-old boy getting stabbed. The violence saw numerous emergency vehicles, including armed police, respond to the scene. Eyewitnesses reported an attack on a car with windows shattering, and some saw the assailants fleeing into a nearby park. Many locals are alarmed, recalling similar past incidents, and expressing concern over rising knife crime among youths. In response, Greater Manchester Police have implemented a Section 60 order to enhance their stop-and-search powers in the area. Detective Inspector Natasha Feerick reassured residents about the commitment to tackling violent crime and urged anyone with information to come forward. Community safety remains a priority, with extra patrols deployed to restore a sense of security.
