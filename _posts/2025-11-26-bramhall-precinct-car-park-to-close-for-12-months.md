The car park at Bramhall precinct in Stockport is closing for a year starting January due to United Utilities' construction of a combined storm overflow. This project is part of an £80m investment to enhance water quality, which includes building five additional storage tanks around Stockport. Local traders are concerned about the impact on foot traffic, urging customers to support their businesses during the closure. The works aim to mitigate flooding and improve the water quality of Micker Brook and the River Mersey. Alternative parking is available at the nearby Meadway Car Park, just a five-minute stroll away. The overall investment will enhance both drinking water and local waterways, with multiple projects scheduled to complete by 2028. Councillors stress the importance of minimising disruptions for residents and businesses during this period.
