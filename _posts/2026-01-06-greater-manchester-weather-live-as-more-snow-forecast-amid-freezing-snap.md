Greater Manchester's in for more snow today, courtesy of a chilly Arctic blast. After some flurries on Sunday night and Monday, the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning, predicting snow and sleet showers mainly between 10am and 11.30am. It's going to feel like -3C this afternoon, so stay bundled up! 

With temperatures hanging around freezing, expect possible travel disruptions on roads, railways, and buses—some schools have already closed, and flights were affected yesterday. Folks are advised to be extra cautious while out and about, especially when travelling.

If you're hitting the road or using public transport, check if your journey is impacted. Stay warm and safe, everyone!
