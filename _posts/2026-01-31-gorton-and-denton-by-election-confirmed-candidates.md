Residents in Gorton and Denton are gearing up for a by-election on February 26, following the resignation of long-serving MP Andrew Gwynne due to health issues. After a bit of drama with Labour, their candidate has been confirmed as Manchester councillor Angeliki Stogia. She's excited to represent the area and focus on unity. Other candidates include Matt Goodwin from Reform, who sees the by-election as a chance to challenge Labour and highlight issues like immigration and taxes. The Liberal Democrats have chosen Jackie Pearcey, a local campaigner, who aims to address the NHS and cost of living. The Green Party's candidate, Hannah Spencer, a local plumber, stresses the importance of community issues and aims to stand against divisive politics. Meanwhile, the Workers’ Party is narrowing down its options for a candidate. It's all shaping up to be an eventful election season in Greater Manchester!
