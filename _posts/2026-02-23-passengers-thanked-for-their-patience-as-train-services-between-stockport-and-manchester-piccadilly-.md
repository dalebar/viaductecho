Train services are back up and running between Stockport and Manchester Piccadilly after nine days of engineering works. The closure, which lasted from 14 to 22 February, saw platforms 1-12 at Piccadilly inactive while crews upgraded the track, signalling equipment, and points for better reliability—it's the first major upgrade since the late 1980s. Network Rail has thanked passengers for their patience during this monumental undertaking. The first trains arrived back at Piccadilly at 5am on 23 February, and an impressive 8,922 replacement bus services operated during the closure. Both Network Rail and Transport for Greater Manchester highlighted the importance of the upgrades for future journeys, expressing gratitude for passenger understanding and the efforts of all involved.
