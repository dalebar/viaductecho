Topshop is making a comeback in Stockport through a partnership with John Lewis, offering new collections in 32 department stores, including Cheadle. This expansion is part of John Lewis's £800 million investment plan as they refresh their brand offerings ahead of the spring/summer season. Topshop and its brother brand Topman had been absent from UK high streets since 2021, when former owner Arcadia went under. Asos kept the brand alive online, but now they’re back in physical stores, having previously appeared at London's Liberty. The launch features 130 popular pieces, including their renowned denim. Topshop's managing director, Michelle Wilson, emphasised the easy access to beloved items, while John Lewis's managing director, Peter Ruis, stated this partnership highlights their ambition in fashion retail. Alongside Topshop, John Lewis is also introducing 14 new fashion brands for both men’s and women’swear, signalling a fresh direction for the iconic retailer.
