A possible bloodstain was found on a car following an altercation in Gorton. Police and crime scene investigators arrived at Ryderbrow Road around 11.30am on Tuesday, February 17, meticulously examining the area, including grass, pavement, and the car. Although there’s a substance on the car’s rear window that looks like blood, its identity hasn’t been confirmed yet. Greater Manchester Police reported that one man was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, and no arrests have been made as investigations continue. Crime scene specialists were seen swabbing and photographing the evidence at the scene.
