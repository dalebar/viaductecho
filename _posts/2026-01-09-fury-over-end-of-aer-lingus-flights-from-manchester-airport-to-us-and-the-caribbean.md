There's a bit of a storm brewing as Unite, the union, is not happy about Aer Lingus deciding to cut its long-haul flights from Manchester Airport after March 31. This move could mean the closure of their Manchester base, putting about 200 jobs at risk, with nearly 130 cabin crew affected. Aer Lingus isn't selling tickets for flights to the US and Caribbean beyond that date, which has left workers feeling anxious about their futures. Despite being a profitable airline, Aer Lingus claims the Manchester base hasn't performed as well as its Irish routes. Unite plans to ballot its members on possible industrial action, with the vote closing on January 26, and strikes could commence in late February. The union's been pushing for transparency from Aer Lingus regarding the financials and rationale for this decision but hasn’t received the info they’re entitled to. Meanwhile, Aer Lingus is working with affected customers on refunds and accommodation as the situation unfolds. It's all a bit of a mess, really!
