Salford's high streets and public spaces are about to get a £1.5m lift, thanks to a government grant. This funding will roll in at £750,000 per year for two years, earmarked for community space enhancements, improved parks, and supporting local shops and town centres. The plan for spending will be shaped through discussions with local MPs and stakeholders, with a deadline to commit by March 2027. Mayor Paul Dennett expressed excitement over this contribution from the Labour government, highlighting the importance of thinking beyond traditional funding sources for Salford's development. Additionally, there's a separate £20m Pride in Place funding for areas like Pendleton and Peel Green, where residents are keen on using it to create more community amenities, especially for kids. Chris Kenyon, a local resident, pointed out the need for more activities for children in the area, emphasising community needs. Overall, the funding is seen as fantastic news for Salford's growth and community well-being.
