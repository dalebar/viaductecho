The Leigh Guided Busway in Greater Manchester, designed to improve bus commutes between Leigh and Manchester, has turned into a popular walking route. Stretching about 13 miles and featuring a kerb-guided section, it has successfully cut bus travel times. Originally a part of the £122m Greater Manchester Bus Priority Package, it now also supports park-and-ride facilities to reduce city traffic. Interestingly, the guided section has become one of Wigan's go-to paths for walkers, thanks to a dedicated walking and cycling track alongside it. Wigan councillor John Vickers highlighted the unexpected success of this initiative, noting its popularity for recreational walks. The region has invested £328m in walking and cycling projects since 2018, expanding the network to over 160km. Dame Sarah Storey, the active travel commissioner, emphasised that creating such facilities encourages public use, with even more routes on the way.
