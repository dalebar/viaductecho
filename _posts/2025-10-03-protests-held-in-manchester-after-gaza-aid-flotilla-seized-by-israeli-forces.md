Today, a pro-Palestine march took place in Manchester, standing in solidarity with Greta Thunberg and activists detained by Israeli forces. Nearly 500 activists were aboard 44 boats carrying aid to Gaza, which were intercepted by the Israeli navy. The Israeli foreign ministry announced all vessels were stopped and their occupants would be deported to Europe. This action has drawn international backlash, with Turkey's foreign ministry labelling it as “an act of terror.” 

Protesters packed the streets of Manchester, chanting slogans like "Free Palestine" and "Stop starving Gaza," as they marched from Piccadilly. This demonstration followed a suspected terror attack at a synagogue in Crumpsall, with organisers condemning the violence and holding a minute’s silence for the victims. The flotilla was reportedly in a high-risk area in international waters, which the activists had previously been warned to avoid. Reports say two Israeli warships attempted to intimidate the activists by circling their boats and jamming communications.
