Oldham council is grappling with an £8m budget cut to fill a £20m funding gap, despite some positive changes in government support. Council leader Arooj Shah highlights that while there's a shift in funding, the effects of austerity are still being felt. Key challenges include soaring costs in adult social care, children’s services, and temporary accommodation, particularly in an area with high deprivation levels.

To balance the books, the council is considering cutting managerial posts, trimming youth centre funding by £100k, and closing a daycare service for adults with disabilities. There's also a plan to revamp the bulky waste collection system to save costs, along with introducing 'Fair Share' charges for families in temporary accommodation who can afford it. Care workers will see a pay rise, but it falls short of the National Living Wage, saving the council roughly £2.46m. Overall, residents can expect significant changes to services that directly affect their daily lives.
