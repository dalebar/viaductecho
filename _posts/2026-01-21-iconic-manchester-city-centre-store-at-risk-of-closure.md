An iconic Manchester store, Russell & Bromley, is on shaky ground after Next acquired the brand following its fall into administration. Out of Russell & Bromley’s 36 stores, only three will be saved—those in Chelsea, Mayfair, and Bluewater, leaving the future of the Manchester shop at St Anns House uncertain, along with 32 other outlets and nine concessions. This puts hundreds of jobs at risk as administrators assess the situation. Next aims to build on the brand’s legacy, investing £2.5 million for the brand and intellectual property, plus £1.3 million for some stock. Russell & Bromley’s CEO mentioned selling the brand was a tough but necessary decision to secure its future. The company has a long history, dating back to 1879, and is known for its premium footwear and accessories. Administrators plan to keep the remaining stores open while exploring options for them.
