A new survey is out, looking into the connection between buying a home and a car, thanks to Swansway Motor Group and Stephenson Browne Estate Agents. It invites Nub News readers to share their insights and offers a chance to win one of three £25 Amazon vouchers. The quick survey covers topics like the type of car and home you have, future moving plans, and factors such as parking, transport links, and electric vehicle charging that influence where you live. It aims to understand how households balance these significant financial decisions. Completing the survey takes just a few minutes, and you can opt to enter the prize draw by leaving your email address—which will only be used for contacting winners. Your thoughts matter, whether you’re a homeowner, renter, or planning your next move, so take part and help shape this insightful study!
