Plans for 1,000 new homes in Heywood are advancing as Rochdale Council has received a planning application for 186 houses off Hareshill Road North. This is part of the broader South Heywood masterplan, initially approved in 2020, which aims to deliver various amenities, including logistics space, a retail centre, a link road, a primary school, and sports facilities. The masterplan falls under the Places for Everyone initiative, aimed at boosting jobs, housing, and sustainable growth across Greater Manchester by 2039. Developer Northstone, backed by the Peel Group, aims to ensure a high standard of design and sustainability in the new homes, featuring attractive architecture, energy efficiency, and community-focused spaces like gardens and greenery. The project highlights the intention to create a safe, welcoming community with a strong sense of place, reducing environmental impacts while enhancing local ecosystems.
