Traffic on the M62 in Greater Manchester was halted this morning due to a vehicle fire after junction 21, near Milnrow. Initially, all eastbound traffic was stopped, leading to long queues stretching past junction 20 at Rochdale. Following the incident, two lanes reopened, but delays continued with one lane still closed. By around 11:19, queues were reported to be about 30 minutes long. The fire has since been dealt with, and all lanes have reopened, although heavy traffic persists between junctions 19 and 21 eastbound. The Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service was involved, and updates are ongoing about the situation.
