Primark's Manchester store has teamed up with The Seam to offer a weekly clothing repair service every Friday until December. Located in the Market Street branch, customers can book repairs online or walk in, though walk-ins depend on availability. The service aims to fix small rips and tears, with repairs taking around 20 to 30 minutes. Prices range from £3 to £10, subsidised by Primark to make repairs more affordable and accessible. This initiative reflects the growing demand for clothing longevity, as highlighted by Vicki Swain from Primark and Layla Sargent from The Seam. The aim is to promote the idea that simple repairs can extend the life of your favourite pieces. Shoppers can find the service in the pop-up area near the Click & Collect desk.
