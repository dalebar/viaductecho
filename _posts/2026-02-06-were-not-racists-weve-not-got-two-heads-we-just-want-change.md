Reform UK's campaign kicked off in Gorton and Denton on February 5, greeted by typical Manchester weather—cold and drizzly. Despite the less-than-ideal conditions, dozens of supporters, journalists, and canvassers gathered to mark the event after the former MP Andrew Gwynne stepped down. Among them was 18-year-old Zack Dale, who expressed his commitment to a tougher crime approach despite facing online and in-person criticism for supporting Reform. The event saw prominent figures, including party leader Nigel Farage and candidate Matt Goodwin, rallying the troops. They stressed the need for change, touching on immigration, the cost-of-living crisis, and past Labour controversies. Farage highlighted the significance of their challenge to Labour's long-standing hold on the constituency since WWII, with supporters enthusiastically backing their message for a “fresh start.” As the event wrapped up, the team prepared to hit the streets for canvassing, with Farage optimistic about their chances ahead of the February 26 by-election. The atmosphere was charged with excitement, as many expressed hope for change in a region that feels overlooked.
