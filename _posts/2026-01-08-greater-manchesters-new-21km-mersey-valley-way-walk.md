A new 21km ‘National River Walk’ called the Mersey Valley Way is set to open in Greater Manchester, linking Stockport town centre to Ashton-upon-Mersey and passing through Sale Water Park. This initiative is part of a government scheme to encourage folks to enjoy nature. Walkers can expect new directional signs and upgrades to existing paths for better accessibility, catering to wheelchairs, prams, cyclists, and horse-riders. It also allows for guided walks and volunteering in nature recovery efforts. The Mersey Valley Way is the first of nine similar walks planned across England. There’ll be a consultation for public input and a competition for children at 50 schools to design its logo. Trafford Council’s Aidan Williams and Stockport Council’s Grace Baynham expressed excitement about the project, highlighting its benefits for community health and local businesses. Baroness Hayman, the government’s access minister, noted this initiative aims to help more people connect with nature and improve accessibility across the UK.
