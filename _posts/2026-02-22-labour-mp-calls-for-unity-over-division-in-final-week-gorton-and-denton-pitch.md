In the Gorton and Denton by-election, Labour MP Andrew Western is urging voters to choose "unity over division" and back Labour’s Angeliki Stogia, warning against splitting the left vote with the Greens. He cautions that doing so could allow Reform UK's Matthew Goodwin to secure a seat in Parliament. This by-election was prompted by the resignation of Labour MP Andrew Gwynne. Polling data suggests Green candidate Hannah Spencer might pose a threat, but Labour dismisses this as unreliable. Lucy Powell emphasised that the contest is primarily between Labour and Reform, denouncing Goodwin's views on English identity as "toxic." Meanwhile, Reform UK's spokesperson accused Labour of neglecting the area and prioritising internal gossip over community needs, claiming that voting for Goodwin is the best way to put Gorton and Denton residents first.
