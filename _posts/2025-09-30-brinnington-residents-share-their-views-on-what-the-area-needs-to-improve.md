The government is rolling out a 'Pride in Place' initiative, investing £20m over ten years across 339 areas to revitalise neighbourhoods by letting locals decide how to use the funds. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stressed the importance of community input, saying it’s time for locals to reclaim their streets from neglect. In Greater Manchester, 19 areas will benefit, including Brinnington, where residents have shared ideas on improving their community. Key suggestions involve boosting the variety of shops to foster social interaction, as many lament the loss of local businesses and community spirit. Longtime resident Warren Hughes noted the shift from a vibrant shopping scene to a more isolated environment, while others echoed the need for spaces that encourage connection. One anonymous local expressed a desire for changes to restore Brinnington's heart, reflecting a longing for the community ties that once flourished there.
