Heads up, late-night drivers in Greater Manchester! This week, from November 24 to 30, several motorways will be shut overnight for maintenance. The closures affect the A627(M), M56, M6, M60, M61, M62, and M66, usually starting around 9pm and lifting by 6am. Last weekend saw over 1.2 million journeys to the city centre as shoppers flocked to the Christmas Markets, so TfGM is recommending public transport options. They’ve got park and ride facilities open across Greater Manchester, along with four pop-up sites. Make sure to plan ahead and stay informed about the closures!
