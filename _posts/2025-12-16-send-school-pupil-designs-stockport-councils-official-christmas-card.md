A talented young illustrator from Stockport, Clayton, has his artwork featured on this year's official Stockport Council Christmas cards. As a SEND student from Castle Hill High School, he created a festive scene of Stockport's viaduct, which will appear on the front cover of council leader Mark Roberts' 2025 Christmas card. Clayton expressed feeling 'famous' for this honour, noting he wanted to draw the viaduct, a familiar sight in his town. Inside the card, Cllr Roberts praised Clayton's talent and acknowledged the exceptional support provided by Castle Hill for students with special educational needs. He emphasized Stockport's commitment to investing in schools and ensuring high-quality education for all children, including those with complex needs. Clayton's design is also being showcased in the 'Beautiful Things' exhibition at the War Memorial Gallery, running until March 15, 2026.
