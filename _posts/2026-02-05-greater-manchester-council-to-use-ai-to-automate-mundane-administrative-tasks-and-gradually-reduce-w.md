Bury Council in Greater Manchester is looking to use artificial intelligence to tackle a £16m budget shortfall. The plan involves automating routine administrative tasks, leading to a gradual reduction in workforce through natural attrition, rather than immediate redundancies. As part of a £3m review, council leaders are examining new tech to fill vacant managerial posts and lessen reliance on agency workers, aiming to save about £1m with these changes.

Coun Sean Thorpe emphasised that embracing AI is crucial for the council’s survival, stressing the potential to enhance efficiency and service delivery. The council intends to introduce various AI tools to improve processes, from note-taking software for social workers to systems that summarise consultation responses efficiently. This move follows similar initiatives in other Greater Manchester councils, like Tameside and Manchester. The proposals, which won’t lead to instant job cuts, will be discussed at a scrutiny meeting on February 10, aiming for a balance between cost savings and improved service for residents.
