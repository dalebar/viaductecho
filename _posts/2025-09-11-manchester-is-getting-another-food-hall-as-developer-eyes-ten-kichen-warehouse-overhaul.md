Plans are in the works to transform the Ducie Street Warehouse in Manchester into a vibrant food hall featuring 10 kitchens, two bars, and a large seating area, provided the council gives it the thumbs up. Located near Piccadilly station, this Grade II listed building currently hosts restaurants, a gym, a cinema, and a 194-bedroom aparthotel. The proposed food hall would replace the gym, which recently shut after a landlord dispute, but the cinema will remain. The project is being driven by Manchester Street Food, an offshoot of a recent Edinburgh venture, aiming to create a lively space supporting local street food vendors while featuring local breweries. Theyâ€™re targeting a 2026 opening and are on the lookout for more sites across the UK. A planning application has been submitted, noting that no extra floors will be added, just some internal changes, including a lit-up lift shaft. The warehouse, steeped in history since 1867, was listed for preservation in 1974, meaning developers must seek planning permission for alterations.
