With Christmas coming up, many families might think about getting a dog, but it's a good time to consider rescue options. Around 30% of UK households own a dog, yet many dogs are in need of homes. Dogs 4 Rescue in Eccles, founded by Emma Billington, is a kennel-free centre aiming to change the perception of rescue dogs by providing a happy environment for them.

If you're not ready to adopt, they offer fostering opportunities or home trials. There are numerous dogs looking for forever homes, including:

- Charlie, a playful Staffordshire Terrier.
- Midnight, a shy Pointer Cross needing patience.
- Maggie, an affectionate Staffordshire Bull Terrier who prefers adult-only, pet-free homes.
- Lucy, an energetic one-year-old who needs a compatible dog buddy.
- Mia, a sensitive mixed breed who thrives with reassurance.
- Kancho, a one-year-old who loves affectionate company but needs a child-free environment.

These pooches are just waiting for a chance to find their perfect humans!
