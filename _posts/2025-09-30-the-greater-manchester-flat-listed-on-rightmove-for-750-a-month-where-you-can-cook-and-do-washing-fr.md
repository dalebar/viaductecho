A £750-a-month studio flat in Salford has caught attention for its minuscule space, leading to jokes about it redefining 'breakfast in bed'—you can actually cook from the bed! Marketed as a 'beautifully furnished single studio flat', it features an open-plan living area, but the kitchen appliances are alarmingly close to the double bed. Renters have expressed disbelief over the £173-per-week price tag, with comments ranging from comparisons to London prices to quips about noise from the fridge impacting sleep. Some cheekily noted that one could easily wash, cook, and clean without leaving the bed due to the lack of floor space. The flat is advertised as having stylish furnishings and conveniences, and is located near parks, but reactions suggest it might not be everyone's cup of tea!
