Greater Manchester's weather this month has been a bit of a washout, and it looks like we're in for another soggy weekend. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain from 9am Saturday to 6am Sunday, especially affecting northern parts of Greater Manchester and southern Scotland. Expect 'persistent and at times heavy' downpours, with up to 40mm of rain widely, and some areas hitting 100mm. Strong winds and occasional thunder may also join the showers. By early Sunday, the heavy rain should ease, giving way to continued strong winds and showers throughout the day. Looking ahead, next week will likely remain unsettled with a mix of rain and drier spells, as temperatures gradually return to average. So, grab your brolly and stay dry!
