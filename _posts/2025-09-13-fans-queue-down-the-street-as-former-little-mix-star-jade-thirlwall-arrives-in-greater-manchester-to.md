Jade Thirlwall, the former Little Mix star, recently celebrated her debut album release in Greater Manchester, attracting around 150 fans who queued down the street for album signings. Her album, "Thatâ€™s Showbiz Baby!", released on September 12, has been well-received by critics and fans alike, currently sitting at number two on the charts. Jade, who gained fame after winning X Factor in 2011, is on a promo tour that includes appearances in various UK cities like London, Birmingham, Leeds, and Newcastle. Over the weekend, she appeared at Wax and Beans, an independent record and coffee shop in Bury, where fans lined up for a chance to meet her. Jade expressed her excitement on Instagram about connecting with fans during her tour. She will return to Manchester on October 12 to perform at the O2 Victoria Warehouse, having already sold out her first solo UK tour. With a Brit award to her name, she's set for a chart battle against Ed Sheeran, who released his album the same day.
