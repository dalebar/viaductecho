Anam Rafay, the woman involved in a murder investigation in Wythenshawe, was found unresponsive after a disturbance on Lulworth Gardens. Emergency services were called around 8.30am on January 27, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody for questioning. Witnesses reported that Anam desperately sought help by banging on a nearby door before her tragic end. Authorities assure there's no wider threat to the public, though a forensic tent and a significant cordon remain in place around the scene as investigations continue.
