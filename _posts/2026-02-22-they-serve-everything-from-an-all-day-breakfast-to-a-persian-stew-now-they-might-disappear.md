You & Me cafe in Prestwich is facing closure as part of the demolition of the Longfield Centre, with plans for a £100m redevelopment that aims to create a new community hub and homes. While some locals welcome the regeneration, many regulars, like Jamie, Steve, and Vera, express sadness about losing a vital social spot where they've built friendships. The cafe has become a lifeline for people, particularly those struggling with loneliness or mental health issues. Although some see the change as necessary progress, many feel the new development will cater more to wealthier residents and overlook the current community's needs. The cafe's manager is upset about the closure, and the council notes they are exploring options for the cafe to continue operating, like potentially using a food van. Regulars worry about finding a comparable place to gather and connect, leaving a palpable sense of loss as the demolition looms.
