In 2015, Stockport faced a struggling town centre but set out on a £1bn regeneration plan. Key developments included Redrock, a £45m leisure hub featuring a cinema, restaurants, and a bowling alley, which opened in 2017 and boosted footfall. The Stockport Exchange business district also flourished, building on its first phase with offices and a hotel. The council's purchase of Merseyway shopping centre in 2016 revitalised retail, and the recent Stockroom opened in 2023, creating space for local businesses and community activities. Major transport upgrades, including the Stockport Interchange, have further improved access. Over 1,200 new homes have been developed, with plans for 8,000 more in the next 15 years. Local events are attracting crowds, enhancing community spirit. Council leader Mark Roberts emphasised the remarkable transformation, reflecting a regained pride in the town. While there’s still work to do, ambitious local leadership is paving the way for a vibrant future in Stockport.
