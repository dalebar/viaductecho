In 2015, Stockport faced a struggling town centre amid broader national changes, like the Conservative government taking power. To rejuvenate the area, a £1bn regeneration scheme was launched, starting with the Redrock leisure complex in 2017, which has since boosted foot traffic and profitability at the Light Cinema. The Stockport Exchange business district followed, featuring offices, a new Holiday Inn, and lively public spaces.

The council also revitalised the Merseyway shopping centre and launched innovative spaces like Stockroom, which attracted over 250,000 visitors in its first ten weeks. Transport links improved with the 2024 Stockport Interchange opening, enhancing connectivity across the town. 

Significant investments turned the historic Underbanks into a trendy hub filled with independent shops and eateries, while local events have drawn crowds. Plans for a new 'walkable' neighbourhood with 1,300 homes have been approved, aiming to expand the community further. Council leader Mark Roberts praised the transformations that have reinstated pride in Stockport, with ambitions for sustainable growth and enhanced infrastructure in the coming years.
