Greater Manchester Police (GMP) arrested over 400 drivers for drink and drug driving during their festive campaign, 'Operation Limit', running from December 1 to January 1. They carried out 1,599 impairment tests and made 448 arrests, split evenly between drink and drug offences. Most of those arrested were over 25, but 15% were 24 or younger. With about one in five fatal collisions linked to impaired drivers, the festive period saw a spike in offending due to increased social activities. The government plans to reduce the drink-drive limit from 35 to 22 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath, aligning with Scotland's law. This initiative is part of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority's Vision Zero aim to eliminate road deaths and serious injuries by 2040. Chief Inspector Michael Parker noted a decrease in arrests this year compared to the previous two years, emphasising their commitment to road safety year-round.
