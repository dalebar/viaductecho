Andy Burnham is keeping a low profile ahead of the Labour Party Conference, limiting his public appearances to avoid ruffling feathers. He recently shared his vision for the UK, suggesting higher council tax in the south and a 50p income tax rate while critiquing a "climate of fear" in Labour. Some Labour MPs are nudging him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer, but this hasn't sat well with the PM's allies, who find his ambitions a bit desperate. Despite this, Burnham remains a popular figure in Greater Manchester, with many residents backing him for leadership, seeing him as a relatable dad-type. He rose to fame standing up for the North during the pandemic and has become a bit of a cultural icon. However, there are issues back home that need addressing, like homelessness and transport strikes. While he insists he's committed to his role as mayor, his political ambitions raise eyebrows, and the question remains whether he can juggle both aspirations and responsibilities effectively.
