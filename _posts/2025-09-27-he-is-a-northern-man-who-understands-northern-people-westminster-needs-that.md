Jack Haughton, a lifelong Conservative voter, is considering switching to Labour if Andy Burnham decides to run for leader. He appreciates Burnham's down-to-earth approach and connection to Greater Manchester. Recently, Burnham hinted at leadership ambitions amidst calls for change within Labour, especially after the party faced setbacks. While he insists he’s not plotting against Keir Starmer, his radical ideas for public control of essential services have caught attention.

Local opinions about Burnham are mixed. Roy Marshall doubts his qualifications for prime minister, citing ongoing transport issues despite Burnham’s reforms. Conversely, Amin Babor Chowdhury believes Burnham represents northern interests and has positively impacted local businesses and transport affordability through the Bee Network. 

New resident Nicky praises the transport system, while Joy Darlington expresses general distrust in politicians, yet supports Burnham’s ideas for public ownership of energy. James Hester, a retired Labour voter, feels disconnected from Starmer’s leadership but holds hope for Burnham, recalling his approachable nature. Overall, there's a blend of skepticism and optimism about Burnham's potential leadership role in reshaping Labour.
