High Peak Comps is buzzing this October with some fantastic prize draws! They're running two major competitions: one offers instant cash prizes from £50 to £5,000, totalling a whopping £200,000, and costs just 99p per ticket. It wraps up on 26 October, with a bonus £10,000 draw for all ticket buyers still in the game.

The second competition gives you a shot at a dream holiday—your choice of a safari or Disneyland, both valued at £15,000, or a £10,000 cash alternative. Tickets are just 39p, and this one closes on 19 October.

High Peak Comps isn't just about prizes; they're also giving back to the community, supporting local charities and schools. With £10 million in prizes awarded since their start in 2020, they’re all about fair and fun chances to win. If you want to get involved, grab your tickets now and check out their Facebook page for updates!
