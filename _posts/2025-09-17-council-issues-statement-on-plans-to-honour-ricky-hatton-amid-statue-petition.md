Tameside Council is open to plans for recognising former boxing champion Ricky Hatton, who sadly passed away last Sunday at 46. Following his death, a petition has been launched for a statue in his hometown of Hyde. The council expressed its readiness to honour Hatton's contributions to the community, ensuring family involvement in discussions. Council leader Eleanor Wills praised Hattonâ€™s generosity and strong community spirit, noting his pride in his roots and recent support for local businesses. A book of condolence is now available at Hyde Town Hall, while Mayor Andy Burnham has promised to consider suitable tributes to Hatton. The Hatton family confirmed he was in good spirits before his passing, with plans for a comeback fight. They ask for privacy during this difficult time, while also noting the widespread love and grief being expressed for Ricky.
