A man has been arrested in connection with a reported rape in Heaton Mersey Park on the evening of 9 September. The 28-year-old from Manchester was detained about an hour after the incident, where the woman alleged that she was approached, threatened with what she thought was a gun, and raped before managing to escape. Police are actively investigating the area for reassurance, with Superintendent Dave Henthorne noting that stranger rapes are rare in Greater Manchester. He praised the victim for her bravery in coming forward and assured the community that there’s no broader risk. Those who might have witnessed the incident or need support are encouraged to reach out to authorities. Victims of sexual assault are reminded that they don’t have to go through it alone, with several local support services available.
