Next week, bus passengers in Greater Manchester are in for a rough ride as strikes hit around two-thirds of services. Over 2,000 members of the Unite union, working for the Bee Network, are walking out from September 19 to 22 due to pay disputes. This disruption comes just as major events, like a Manchester United match and performances by Peter Kay and Tom Grennan, are taking place. All boroughs except Bolton and Wigan will be affected, with school buses and many late-night services also not running.

While local councillors support the drivers' cause for fair pay, they're concerned about the impact on commuters and workers needing to travel. The union says the operators' offers of 3.5% and 6% for pay increases are unsatisfactory given the cost of living crisis. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) is urging people to plan ahead, with some bus tickets being usable on trams during the strike days. If youâ€™re travelling next week, expect a busy city and consider avoiding peak times!
