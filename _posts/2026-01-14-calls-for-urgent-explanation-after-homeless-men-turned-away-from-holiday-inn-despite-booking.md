A hotel chain is under scrutiny after two homeless men were denied accommodation at the Holiday Inn Express in Manchester during extreme cold conditions, despite having a valid booking paid for by an outreach charity. The receptionist cited hotel policy against allowing entry to those ‘off the street’. Amanda Thompson from the charity Two Brews described the incident as ‘visual discrimination’ and deeply inhumane, especially given the recent deaths of vulnerable rough sleepers in the area. Florence Eshalomi, the chairwoman of Parliament’s housing committee, has demanded an explanation from IHG Hotels and Resorts, which owns Holiday Inn, regarding their policies and staff training on handling homeless guests. She highlighted the urgency of the situation, given that the hotel is contracted to provide emergency accommodation for the homeless. Holiday Inn Express Manchester later acknowledged the incident was not consistent with their welcoming policy and issued an apology. One of the denied men, Callum Donaghey, expressed feelings of worthlessness and despair at the rejection, especially with life-threatening temperatures outside.
