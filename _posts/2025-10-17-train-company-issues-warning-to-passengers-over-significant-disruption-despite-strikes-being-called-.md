CrossCountry Trains is warning of 'significant disruption' for Saturday, October 18, despite a strike by train managers and conductors being suspended after progress in talks. This announcement comes too late to revise their timetable, resulting in a limited service. Only a reduced number of services will run to the South West, South Coast, and north of York, with Birmingham to Manchester services operating every two hours. No trains will stop at several key stations, including Coventry and Nottingham. Shiona Rolfe, Managing Director of CrossCountry, expressed regret over the disruption and encouraged passengers to check for options to adjust their travel plans. Meanwhile, the RMT union has stated that a planned strike for November is still on the cards as they continue to seek a resolution.
