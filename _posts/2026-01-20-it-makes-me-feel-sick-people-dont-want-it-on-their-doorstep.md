Salford council is on the case after a whopping 200 tonnes of rubbish was dumped at the Cambridge industrial estate in Broughton. A mix of mattresses, furniture, and household waste was abandoned, likely transported in multiple trips by vans and tipper trucks from around Greater Manchester and beyond. Residents were understandably upset as the council acknowledged the distressing situation, which could cost taxpayers about £44,000 for cleanup.

Councillor Barbara Bentham expressed her disgust, emphasising that this isn't the usual fly-tipping Salford deals with, as it’s more of a commercial operation rather than just a case of "one man and a van." The site, owned by the council, had to be secured with extra barriers and CCTV after the culprits went to great lengths to access the area. 

Bentham reminded residents to use licensed waste carriers and offered bulky waste collection services. She highlighted the importance of responsible rubbish disposal, warning that failing to check the legitimacy of waste removal could lead to personal responsibility for illegal dumping. The council is pressing on with investigations and promises to prosecute anyone caught fly-tipping.
