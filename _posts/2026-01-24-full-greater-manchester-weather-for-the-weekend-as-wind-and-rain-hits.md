This weekend in Greater Manchester kicks off dry on Saturday morning, with temps between 7C and 8C. However, rain kicks in later on Saturday evening, starting around 8pm and spreading northwest across the region. The Met Office warns of unsettled conditions, especially in the west, with eastern parts possibly facing heavier rain. Sunday morning isn’t looking any better, as rain will be ongoing from about 6am, continuing well into the afternoon and evening. Temps will stay steady around 7C to 8C. Monday brings a cooler change, with highs of 4C to 8C, but at least it starts off dry before a generally dry day. So, keep your brollies handy!
