Stepping Hill Hospital has just opened its new outpatients building, equipped with top-notch facilities to provide high-quality care across various services like cancer care, cardiology, and more. The building, which includes 50 rooms, was constructed using a cutting-edge modular method and is located on the northern part of the site, where old wards used to stand. An official opening ceremony took place this week, attended by local MPs and NHS representatives. After starting construction in January 2024, the facility is expected to be fully operational within weeks. Karen James OBE, Chief Executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, expressed gratitude for the collaborative effort that made this project possible. MTX Project Director Paul Williams also shared pride in creating a modern and welcoming space designed to enhance patient and staff experiences. All in all, itâ€™s a great new chapter for Stepping Hill!
