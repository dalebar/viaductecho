An investigation has found that 57 of Manchester's flood defences, deemed 'high consequence', are not up to standard months after devastating New Year floods affected many homes and businesses. This means 17% of critical defences could potentially fail in future floods. Despite ongoing calls for action, the Environment Agency states flood protection is a top priority and has redirected £108 million for repairs. However, local councillors, like John Leech, are frustrated with slow progress and lack of guaranteed funding from the government, highlighting an urgent need for resources to safeguard residents. Manchester council acknowledges the investigation's concerns and emphasises their cooperation with the Environment Agency to strengthen flood defences. They’re actively working on repairs since the flood and securing future funding. The government, led by Labour floods minister Emma Hardy, is pledging a massive £10.5 billion investment in flood defences to improve conditions until 2036.
