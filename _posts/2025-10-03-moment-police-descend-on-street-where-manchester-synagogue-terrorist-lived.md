A video has caught the moment armed police raided the street where Jihad Al-Shamie, the Manchester synagogue attacker, lived. He killed two people and injured three others at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on Yom Kippur. Al-Shamie drove into worshippers then launched a knife attack, reportedly wearing a fake explosive vest. The victims were named as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Police descended on Langley Crescent in Prestwich, where Al-Shamie, aged 35 and a British citizen of Syrian descent, had lived since around 2021. Neighbours mentioned seeing him doing workouts in his garden and noted his varied clothing style, from full gowns to casual wear. Police were on the scene in tactical gear, with multiple vehicles present as they responded to the threat. Further details revealed Al-Shamie entered the UK as a child, gaining British citizenship in 2006.
