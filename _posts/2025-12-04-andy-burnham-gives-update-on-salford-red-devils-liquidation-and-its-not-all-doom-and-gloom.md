Andy Burnham updated on the Salford Red Devils' recent liquidation, noting it’s “not all doom and gloom.” The rugby league club faced closure due to unpaid taxes, ending a 152-year legacy. Despite a tough year, with relegation after a squad deplete of stars, there’s hope for a fresh start. Burnham met with the Rugby Football League (RFL) to discuss options, revealing potential for a new team in the Championship next year. The recent purchase of the stadium by Salford council strengthens the city's support for a new club to emerge from this turmoil. While acknowledging the challenges, he emphasised the need for government backing to sustain rugby league in the region. Looking ahead, fans remain hopeful, with the first game of the second-tier Championship set for January 16 against Oldham. A club spokesperson expressed gratitude to loyal fans and a desire for the club's history to endure, despite the emotional weight of this transitional phase.
