Krazy Races is coming back to Stockport on Sunday, 9 August, for an exciting free soapbox race that’s set to be 'bigger and better'! Up to 40 teams will race from St Peter's Square to Chestergate in homemade soapboxes, relying solely on gravity and guts. They’ll compete for the fastest time, best design, and best-dressed team, while dodging hay bales along the way. This year’s event, supported by Totally Stockport BID, marks the third occurrence, aiming to attract even more visitors than before.

Thirteen teams have already signed up, with several raising money for local charities like Springhill Hospice and Prevent Breast Cancer. The organisers promise a day of “thrills, spills, and soapbox mayhem.” Danny Scoffin, Head of Business at Krazy Races, is looking forward to bringing new features to this event after a two-year break. Cllr Micheala Meikle highlighted the positive impact of the event on the local economy and community spirit. Keep an eye on the Krazy Races website for more info and find out how you can get involved!
