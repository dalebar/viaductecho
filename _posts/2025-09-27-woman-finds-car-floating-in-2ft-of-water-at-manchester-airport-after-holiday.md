Sharon Rainford, 55, came home from a lovely ten-day holiday in Turkey to find her Ford Focus submerged in two feet of water at Manchester Airport's JetPark 3. After being told about overnight flooding due to a "freak storm," she and her husband discovered staff trying to pump water away in the car park. Unfortunately, they were stuck with a ruined car and a hefty £140 taxi fare home. Despite assurances from the airport about covering expenses and contacting them once the water cleared, Sharon feels left in limbo without her car or an apology. She managed to check on her vehicle later, wading through water with her husband, and found it electrically functional, but she's still waiting for her insurance to sort things out. Despite paying £89 for parking, she’s frustrated with the lack of support and communication from the airport about her situation.
