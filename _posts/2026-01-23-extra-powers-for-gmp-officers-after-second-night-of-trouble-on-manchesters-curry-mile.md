Police in Manchester have ramped up their powers to stop and search suspects due to ongoing disturbances on Curry Mile, following trouble that resulted in damage and scuffles. A dispersal order was enacted to clear certain areas, and four arrests have been made, including three for affray. The police have also authorised a Section 60 authority, enabling them to search individuals without suspicion for 24 hours across defined locations. This is part of efforts to prevent further unrest tied to the conflict in Syria. Chief Superintendent David Meeney highlighted their commitment to facilitating peaceful protests while clamping down on disorder. He reassured the public of an increased police presence and stressed that anyone causing trouble will face consequences. There’s also a call for witnesses related to a stabbing incident at Exchange Quay. Anyone with info is encouraged to reach out to Salford CID or Crimestoppers.
