A graffiti artist, nicknamed 'the Salford Banksy' by police, was nabbed after a foot chase while spray-painting a bridge on Agecroft Road during rush hour. Officers from Greater Manchester Police's Salford division caught him mid-artwork, with PC Clarke leading the pursuit despite recovering from a recent 10k run. They seized a dozen cans of spray paint, and the artist remains in custody. The police emphasised that graffiti is criminal damage and costs the community to clean up, and many locals were reportedly pleased with the arrest. Officers will continue patrolling the Swinton & Pendlebury area to tackle local issues.
