MP Jim McMahon expressed serious concern over a large-scale disturbance in Oldham town centre involving around 100 youths, with reports of fights and fireworks on Thursday night. Videos showed chaos, prompting police to issue a dispersal order and ramp up patrols. McMahon reached out to the police and council for reassurance to residents and stressed the need for personal responsibility alongside the authority's actions. Insp Kat Murray from the Oldham Central Neighbourhood Policing Team acknowledged the disorder as alarming and highlighted that their patrols aim to prevent further anti-social behaviour (ASB) and support the community. Residents are encouraged to contact their local team for help regarding ASB.
