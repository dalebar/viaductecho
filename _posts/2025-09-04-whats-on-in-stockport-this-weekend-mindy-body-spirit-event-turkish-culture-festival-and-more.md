This weekend in Stockport, there are a handful of lively events lined up! 

Firstly, the Mind Body Spirit Event at Stockport Masonic Guildhall is happening on Saturday and Sunday, from 10 AM to 6 PM. It’s all about connecting with others and exploring unique therapies to support self-care – sounds a bit uplifting, doesn’t it?

Over at Merseyway Shopping Centre, the Turkish Culture Festival promises a taste of vibrant music, dance, and authentic eats like baklava and gözleme, also running on Saturday and Sunday, 10 AM to 6 PM.

On Saturday at 1 PM, catch Ian F Ball performing at HMV with tracks from his new album "Better Late Than Never” – a free sesh worth a look!

Lastly, don’t miss "Quartet" at CHADS Theatre in Cheadle Hulme, running from 6th to 13th September. This comedic take on aging opera singers is sure to be both funny and poignant.

Fancy something else? You can submit your own event too. Enjoy!
