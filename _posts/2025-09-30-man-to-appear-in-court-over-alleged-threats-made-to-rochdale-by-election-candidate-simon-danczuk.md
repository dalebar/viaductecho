A man named Zaffar Hussain, 25, from Rochdale, is set to appear in court following an alleged online threat made against Simon Danczuk, who was the Reform UK candidate in a recent by-election. This contest took place in February 2024, where George Galloway from the Workers Party clinched victory. Hussain was arrested on February 27 and charged with malicious communications with intent. Heâ€™s currently out on bail and has a court date at Wigan Magistrates' Court on December 17, 2025. The by-election was shortly followed by a general election in July 2024, resulting in Galloway losing his seat to Labour's Paul Waugh.
