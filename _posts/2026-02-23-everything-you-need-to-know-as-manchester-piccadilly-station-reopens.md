Manchester Piccadilly train station has reopened today, February 23, after a nine-day closure for essential upgrades. The station was nearly fully shut during the half-term break, with platforms 1 to 12 closed and no services running to the south or east. This closure was part of a massive £8 million project by Network Rail, aimed at enhancing track and signalling for improved reliability, as the station handles around 400,000 trains a year. The first trains are back on the tracks this morning, and despite the reopening, some follow-up works are scheduled for March 1 and March 22.
