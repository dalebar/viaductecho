On Tuesday, Stockport's weather will be a mix of clouds and rain. Temperatures will range from a cool 12°C in the morning to a mild 19°C in the afternoon. Humidity will be quite high at 74%, and there's a 71% chance of afternoon showers, so expect some dampness. While the day starts off partly cloudy, it’ll likely get cloudier as the day goes on, leading to those rain showers. A gentle breeze, reaching up to 14 mph, will keep things feeling fresh.

If you're commuting, it's a good idea to bring a waterproof jacket or umbrella, especially in the afternoon. And watch out for moderate winds if you're cycling or walking. For outdoor plans, aim for the morning to enjoy a break from the rain— layering up is recommended to cope with the changing temperatures!
