Stockport’s weather on Tuesday is set to be a bit of a mixed bag. Expect a mild day with temperatures ranging from 12°C in the morning to a comfy 19°C later on. It’ll start off partly cloudy but cloud cover will increase, bringing a fair chance of rain in the afternoon—about 71% to be precise. Humidity will be on the high side at 74%, making things feel a tad damp. A light breeze will keep things fresh, reaching up to 14 mph.

For commuters, the rain might disrupt plans, so packing a waterproof jacket or umbrella is a smart move. Cyclists and pedestrians should keep their wits about them with those winds. If you’re planning to be outdoors, the morning looks better for activities before the rain rolls in! Dressing in layers is key to handling the fluctuating temperatures throughout the day.
