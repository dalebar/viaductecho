Stockport's weather on Tuesday looks like a mix of clouds and rain, with temps ranging from 12°C in the morning to a mild 19°C in the afternoon. Expect high humidity at 74% and a 71% chance of rain, particularly later in the day. Morning skies will start off partly cloudy before thickening and bringing showers. A gentle breeze will be blowing at speeds of up to 14 mph.

For commuters, it's wise to prepare for wet conditions—definitely grab a waterproof jacket or umbrella if you're heading out, especially in the afternoon. With the wind, cyclists and pedestrians should be cautious too. Dressing in layers is recommended to adapt to the changing temperatures throughout the day, and if you're planning any outdoor activities, it's best to do them in the morning when the weather may be a bit kinder.
