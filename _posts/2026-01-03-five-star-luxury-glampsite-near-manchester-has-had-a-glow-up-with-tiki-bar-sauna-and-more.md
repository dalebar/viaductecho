The Secret Garden Glamping, near Manchester, is a fab spot for a luxurious woodland getaway, open year-round, attracting visitors regardless of the weather. Nestled in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, the glampsite features 13 unique units, many equipped with private hot tubs. Recent upgrades include a tiki bar called The Lost Lagoon and the UK's first outdoor salt sauna, perfect for a spa-like experience in nature. Started by Derry Green during the pandemic, this site has turned into a multi-million pound venture, even bagging accolades like the Camping, Glamping and Holiday Park of the Year at the 2024 Visit England Awards. Guests can enjoy convenient QR-code ordering for food and drinks straight to their units. Popular accommodations include The Lookout, with a wood-burning hot tub, and the transformed Keep unit boasting a cold plunge and bar area. The Tree Tops unit offers a stunning treetop experience with all the creature comforts. For pricing details, check out their website or social media.
