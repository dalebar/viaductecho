Get ready for AMAZE on 21 and 22 February from 5:30 to 8:30 pm at Merseyway Square in Stockport! This free event will feature a stunning projection that brings to life the personal stories of local residents, highlighted on the iconic Merseyway car park screen. Created by Stockroom in collaboration with Illuminos, the show is made from stories collected in workshops led by Stockport illustrator Molly O’Donoghue. 

The event is designed for everyone and will also include live DJ sets from SHIMRISE, screen printing workshops, badge making, and hands-on activities for families. Stockroom will be open late, offering a welcoming space to enjoy and create. 

Councillor Dan Oliver and Molly O'Donoghue are both excited about the community-focused project, which celebrates Stockport's unique experiences. It's an unmissable half-term event, showcasing the town in a new light. So, head down, grab a brew, and enjoy a night full of creativity and community spirit!
