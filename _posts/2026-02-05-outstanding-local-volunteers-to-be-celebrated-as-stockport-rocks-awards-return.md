Stockport's biggest volunteer event, Stockport Rocks!, is back this May for its third year, celebrating local heroes in the community. Following over 200 nominations last year, this event will recognise volunteers across eleven categories such as 'Young Volunteer' and 'Unsung Hero'. With more than 57,000 volunteers in Stockport, the aim is to honour those dedicating their time to help others. The awards ceremony will be held at Edgeley Park, home of Stockport County, organised by Stockport Volunteer Hub and Sector 3. Clare Finch from Sector 3 highlighted the incredible impact volunteers have in the community, calling them "quiet heroes." Last year’s Volunteer of the Year, Bernard Kivel, was acknowledged for transforming the Heaton Norris Community Centre over two decades. Nominations for 2023 are open until 16 March on the Stockport Volunteer Hub website.
