Fines for parents taking kids on term-time holidays in Greater Manchester have shot up over the last ten years, with over 41,000 issued in the 2024/25 school year alone. That's about 967 fines for every 10,000 pupils, marking the highest rate since 2016/17. The number has doubled since before the pandemic, when there were around 20,500 fines in 2018/19. 

Oldham stands out, issuing 6,045 fines last year, averaging nearly 1,500 per 10,000 pupils—making it the highest in the country. In contrast, Trafford had the lowest rate at just over 400. Across England, the total fines hit 459,000 in the same period, with the North issuing more fines than the South or Midlands. 

Penalty notices primarily target unauthorised absences for holidays, representing 93% of all fines. The fine starts at £80 if paid promptly, rising to £160 if not. Overall, it’s clear that taking holidays during term-time is a pricey business for parents in the region!
