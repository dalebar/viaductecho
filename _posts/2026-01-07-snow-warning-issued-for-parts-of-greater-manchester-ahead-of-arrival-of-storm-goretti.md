The Met Office has issued a snow warning for parts of Greater Manchester as Storm Goretti approaches, set to hit on Thursday. The yellow weather warning begins at 5pm and lasts until midday Friday, particularly affecting Eastern boroughs like Oldham, Rochdale, Tameside, and Stockport. There's a chance of heavy snow with accumulations reaching up to 30cm on higher ground, especially in the Peak District. While not everywhere will experience snowfall, travel disruptions are likely, including delays for vehicles, air, and rail services, as well as possible power cuts. Snow is expected to begin around 6pm Thursday, with wintry conditions also impacting parts of Cheshire and Derbyshire. Thankfully, Manchester city centre and the western Greater Manchester areas are currently not under this warning. The wider region, including areas from the West Midlands to parts of Wales, is under various warnings, with an amber alert in place for certain areas. Stay safe and keep an eye on the weather!
