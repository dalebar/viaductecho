A new bus route, the number 30, is set to launch in Manchester on January 4, connecting underserved areas of Salford to the Trafford Centre. This route will replace the X50 and serve areas like Trafford Park, MediaCity, and Ordsall Lane, which has seen significant residential growth with many new apartments. Operated by an all-electric fleet, the bus will run seven days a week with services every half-hour from Monday to Saturday. Salford Mayor Paul Dennett and local residents have highlighted the need for improved public transport in the rapidly growing Salford Quays area. The new service aligns with Greater Manchester’s broader transport goals, including increasing public transport usage and ensuring accessibility to residents. This announcement follows major achievements in local transport, such as a rise in passenger numbers and the introduction of more electric buses. Overall, this initiative is a step toward enhancing connectivity and reducing carbon emissions in the region.
