Emergency crews in south Manchester were busy Sunday afternoon (January 4) at Painswick Park in Wythenshawe, searching under a frozen lake for a dog. Around 12.30pm, the area was cordoned off as specialist fire teams, including the Water Incident Unit, launched a search using boats. Sadly, the dog was found deceased in the water after reportedly becoming stuck while out with its owner. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) confirmed their attendance with two fire engines, as firefighters used equipment to recover the dog.
