Diane Kenyon is grieving after being informed of her husband Michael's death via a phone call while on a bus. Greater Manchester Police say they tried to meet her in person but resorted to a phone call when that didn’t work out. Michael, a 58-year-old armed forces veteran, passed away at home from lung cancer on September 19. Diane was on her way to visit him when she received the news. The call shocked her, and she expressed how callous it felt to be told like that in front of other passengers. After the call, she asked the bus driver to let her off, and police later picked her up to ensure she got home safely. Diane has since lodged two complaints with GMP but hasn't heard back yet. The police expressed condolences and confirmed they were reviewing her complaint.
