The NHS is raising alarms about early hospital cases of flu and Covid-19, particularly in children, signalling a potential winter crisis. With flu cases starting to spike, they’re urging eligible individuals, especially children and young adults, to get their winter vaccinations. As half term approaches, parents are encouraged to ensure their children’s vaccine consent forms are submitted or to visit local clinics if they've missed school vaccination sessions. Current vaccination rates are lower than anticipated, despite over a million doses administered in the North West since the campaign began. Health officials stress that vaccinations are crucial for reducing hospitalisations, highlighting various accessible vaccination options across Greater Manchester. Anyone showing symptoms of flu or Covid-19 is advised to limit contact with others, particularly vulnerable individuals.
