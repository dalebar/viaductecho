The restoration of a section of the Manchester, Bolton, and Bury canal, which collapsed almost 90 years ago, is set to wrap up this year. The dramatic breach in 1936, near Nob End locks, resulted in millions of gallons of water rushing into the River Irwell but, thankfully, no injuries were reported. Now, developer Watson is reviving a 700-metre stretch of waterway as part of a new housing estate project in Little Lever. The Gulf for a new towpath and links to the community is also a focus, thanks to support from local groups like the Inland Waterways Association and the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society. Plans include a café and a canoe school, aiming to enhance local wellbeing and the environment. Completion of the restoration is expected by late summer 2026, with water flow restored by early 2027. Community involvement is strong, as the canal society continues efforts to ensure the waterway becomes fully navigable again, celebrating the area's heritage along the way.
