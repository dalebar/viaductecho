Labour councillors in Stockport are raising alarms about the growing housing crisis, claiming that owning a home is becoming an “unrealistic dream” for many residents. They reported a 45% increase in households in housing need, with over 9,000 on the social housing register. The council is set to spend £2m on emergency housing due to rising demand. The situation affects community dynamics, with many struggling to afford homes. Stockport's house prices are on the rise, averaging £307,000, higher than the national average. However, plans are underway for a significant regeneration scheme to build 8,000 new homes. The council is working on a local plan for development, with a target submission date by November 2026. The Lib Dem council has amended a housing motion to call for government funding for more homes and to protect green spaces. The leader emphasised a focus on using brownfield sites first. The amended motion passed with 38 votes in favour and 18 abstentions, showcasing the need for a balanced approach to tackle the housing crisis alongside preserving community spaces.
