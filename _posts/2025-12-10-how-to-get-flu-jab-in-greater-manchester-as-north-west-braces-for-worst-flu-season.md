The NHS is calling on everyone in the North West eligible for a flu shot to get vaccinated before December 11, as they brace for a particularly nasty flu season. Hospital admissions related to flu have surged, with around 295 hospitalised last week, double from the same time last year. The dominant strain, a mutated variant called A(H3N2), is driving this early wave of cases. Dr Linda Charles-Ozuzu stresses the importance of getting the vaccination to protect against illness and ease the strain on NHS services over the festive period. 

With A&E departments in Greater Manchester facing increased pressure and requests for help soaring, the NHS is implementing additional measures to tackle the rise in flu and respiratory symptoms. They’re encouraging everyone eligible to book their free flu jab through GPs, local pharmacies, or online services. Various walk-in clinics and outreach programs are available to ensure vulnerable groups, including the homeless and housebound, can receive vaccination. For those who don’t qualify for a free jab, private options are available at pharmacies for around £18-£20.
