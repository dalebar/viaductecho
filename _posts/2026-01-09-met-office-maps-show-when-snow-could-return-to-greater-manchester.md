Greater Manchester's kicked off 2026 with a right dose of wintry weather, seeing snow and ice causing chaos recently. Thankfully, it largely dodged the worst of Storm Goretti, which hit other parts of the UK hard. Still, many areas faced wintry conditions, impacting roads in the Peak District and train services between Manchester, Sheffield, and Birmingham. Expect more wintry showers today, particularly in Oldham and Tameside, with some snow flurries possibly returning around 6pm and heavier snow affecting Bury, Rochdale, and Oldham later. Tomorrow morning might see sleet and snow moving eastward from Wigan, with heaviest snowfall expected north of Bolton and Bury. By lunchtime, heavy rain is on the way. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice is in place for eastern Greater Manchester on Sunday. After all this chill, temps are set to climb early next week. Stay warm!
