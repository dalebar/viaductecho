Aer Lingus has announced it will completely halt transatlantic flights from Manchester Airport by March 31, 2026. This includes ending Manchester-New York services from February 23, 2026. However, services to Ireland will remain unaffected. Customers will be contacted directly about cancellations, with options for reaccommodation and refunds. The airline is also planning to operate flights from Dublin to Barbados during April and May to assist impacted travellers.

The decision follows growing concerns about the viability of the Manchester base, which affects about 200 jobs. Aer Lingus cited poor performance of long-haul routes compared to its Irish operations as a key factor. Manchester Airport reassured that despite the withdrawal of Aer Lingus's long-haul flights, overall connectivity remains strong, with other airlines continuing to serve these routes. They affirmed Aer Lingus will still maintain a significant presence in Manchester through its short-haul network.
