Mytham Road in Little Lever, Bolton, is set to stay closed into the weekend due to a sinkhole caused by a leaking pipe. Engineers were called in on Thursday, and they've been working on repairs ever since. The road is taped off near Mytham Primary School, and locals are being asked to steer clear of the area. United Utilities and Bolton council have confirmed that the repair work is anticipated to finish this weekend, and they're thanking the community for their understanding during this disruption. Safety is a priority, so the road closure will remain in effect until the repairs are completed.
