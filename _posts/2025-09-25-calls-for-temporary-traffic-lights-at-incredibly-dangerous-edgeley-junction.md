Residents in Stockport are raising alarm over a dangerous junction at Booth Street and Shaw Heath, exacerbated by the ongoing closure of the Greek Street bridge until 2026. Traffic lights currently allow constant flow, leading to safety concerns for pedestrians, especially those with mobility issues. Local councillor Matt Wynne cites a lack of solutions, despite previous promises for temporary traffic lights and a pedestrian crossing. Concerns include near-misses with vehicles ignoring red lights. While Stockport Council claims to be monitoring the situation, residents feel the response has been inadequate, particularly after recent accidents. They urge reporting any instances of reckless driving to Greater Manchester Police. Network Rail, responsible for the bridge replacement, highlights the project as a long-term investment for improved transport reliability in the area.
