Stockport's been hit with a flood alert and a yellow weather warning due to heavy rain over the weekend. The Environment Agency says flooding is 'possible' in parts of the River Mersey catchment because river levels are rising. An update is expected by 10am on Tuesday 16 December. The Met Office's yellow weather warning is in effect until 11.59pm on Monday 15 December, suggesting risks of flooding, building damage, power cuts, and travel disruptions, including road closures and public transport cancellations. Areas most at risk include low-lying spots like Micker, Cringle, Sinderland, and Poynton Brooks. Residents should steer clear of low-lying footpaths and bridges near watercourses. Stay tuned for further updates!
