Sorrelle Turnbull, a brave young girl from Bury, fought and conquered Infant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia as a baby, undergoing over three years of treatment including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Now 11, she has embraced a new challenge, becoming a world champion in martial arts at the age of 11, winning gold in the para section at the Martial Arts World Championships in Niagara Falls, alongside her sister Olivia, who took home bronze. Their granddad, Sam Price, is immensely proud and highlights the family's journey nearly a decade post-cancer diagnosis. He documented Sorrelle's experiences in a book titled 'Small Boat in a Big Ocean,' with proceeds benefiting the hospital. Sam’s heartfelt writings aim to support and inspire others facing childhood cancer, and they continue to give back by sharing Christmas gifts with hospital patients each year. The family’s achievements are not only a celebration of Sorrelle’s health but also a beacon of hope for others navigating similar paths.
