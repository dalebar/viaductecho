Prestwich village is gearing up for a big revamp, with £1m earmarked to demolish the Longfield shopping centre. Bury council's cabinet is poised to approve around £3.5m for further regeneration plans, which aim to bring in new retail spaces, a market and food hall, leisure amenities, and a fresh home for Prestwich library. They're also planning to build 200 new homes on the current car park. 

The first phase, a new travel hub featuring a multi-storey car park, is well underway, expected to wrap up by July 2026. The planned demolition fits within an outline planning application already approved. Soon, detailed plans will be needed to secure funding from the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. Another £2.25m will be allocated for design and planning, and arrangements are in place to temporarily relocate the library during construction. The aim is to create a community hub that truly connects with locals. Overall, this redevelopment is a joint effort between Bury council and Muse Places, ensuring the project moves smoothly despite needing to manage existing tenants in Longfield.
