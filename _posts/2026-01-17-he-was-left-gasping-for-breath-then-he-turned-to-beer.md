Michael Ashcroft is quite the optimistic chap, despite facing challenges in 2025 due to a tumour at the top of his spine that required radiotherapy. After enduring some intense health scares, he found solace in creating art. Instead of "dry January," he’s decided to paint a series of mini oil paintings celebrating pints of beer from his pub visits, aiming for one each day of the month. 

His journey into art began after a life-changing moment in the hospital, leading him to leave engineering to pursue his passion. With roots in Lancashire, his vibrant work captures the essence of Manchester and beyond, showcasing everything from cityscapes to poignant personal moments. Despite the ups and downs, including ongoing issues related to his health, Michael channels his experiences into his art. His pint pot challenge has gained popularity, making art accessible for new collectors. With a cheeky sense of humour, he reflects on his journey and the joy it brings him, all while keeping an eye on his next hospital appointment.
