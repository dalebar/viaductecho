Lucy Powell has been elected as Labour's new deputy leader, winning 54% of the votes against Bridget Phillipson, who garnered 46%. Announced on October 25, this follows Angela Rayner's resignation. Powell, representing Manchester Central since 2012, emphasised the need for Labour to change direction and better connect with communities. She aims to reshape the party's message and reject narratives that blame immigration for national issues. 

Despite a disappointing turnout of 16.6%, with 160,993 of 970,642 eligible voters participating, Powell's win is seen as a fresh opportunity for Labour to challenge the government from the back benches, free from cabinet restraints. Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the urgency for renewal within the party after recent electoral setbacks.

Meanwhile, Phillipson congratulated Powell and reiterated the importance of unity as they head into upcoming elections. Powellâ€™s appointment makes her the fourth woman to hold the deputy leader position in Labour's history.
