Residents of Farnworth Green, a new housing development in Greater Manchester, faced issues like harassment, intimidation, and racism shortly after moving in, according to regeneration boss Tim Heatley. Completed in 2025, the development consists of 97 homes and aimed to revitalise the area's town centre. While there was initially high demand for the properties, false social media rumours about asylum seekers living there contributed to various social problems such as anti-social behaviour and crime. Heatley noted that these challenges reflected broader issues in the region and emphasised the importance of community collaboration to address them. He clarified that no asylum seekers are housed in the development, stating all tenants are paying rent. Despite the struggles, Heatley remains optimistic about the future of Farnworth Green, highlighting its transformation and the ongoing improvements being made through cooperation with local services and residents. He's incredibly proud of the project, seeing its potential for impactful regeneration across Greater Manchester.
