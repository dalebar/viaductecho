Today in Greater Manchester, expect mostly cloudy skies with light rain or drizzle mainly in the morning, but it should ease off later. Daytime temps will hit around 10C, making it feel a bit chilly. The afternoon might bring some brighter spells in sheltered spots, and with light winds, it won’t be as biting as earlier in the week. No weather warnings are in place, so travel should be fine, but just be cautious of damp roads and pavements. For Saturday, the forecast is similar—overcast with light, brief rain, and highs of about 12C. Sunday looks much the same with persistent cloud and occasional drizzle, keeping that cool, grey vibe going. Looks like the weather won't really turn around until early next week!
