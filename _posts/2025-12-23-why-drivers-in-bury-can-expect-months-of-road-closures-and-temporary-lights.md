Roadworks for the £5.7m Bee Active travel scheme in Bury are set to continue into 2026, focusing on improving walking and cycling routes. The project, which includes multiple phases, involves significant road and lane closures, particularly on Market Street and Rochdale Road. Bury Council aims to make local travel safer and greener, encouraging less car use. 

From January 5, Market Street will close for around 18 months, but work is expected to take about 24 weeks. Traffic diversions and advance warning signs will be put up, with continuous access for pedestrians and Bury College. In early 2026, improvements will be made to various junctions and crossings, including signalised crossings and road resurfacing. Other works involve one-way routes, footpath widening, and maintaining access for local businesses and the mosque. Motorists should brace for temporary traffic lights, lane closures, and full closures in certain areas throughout the project.
