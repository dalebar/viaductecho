Officers stopped a Range Rover in Rochdale on January 17 and discovered £150,000 worth of drugs inside, totalling over 10kg of Class A and Class B substances. A 45-year-old man was arrested for possession with intent to supply and driving under the influence of drugs, and he remains in custody. Further searches at his linked address led to two additional arrests, a 20-year-old and a 44-year-old, both on similar drug charges. They’ve been bailed while investigations continue. Detective Sergeant Niamh McCarthy highlighted the no-tolerance stance on drug distribution and encouraged the community to report any related activities via various channels.
