Detectives are reaching out to any remaining eyewitnesses of the Crumpsall synagogue attack, which claimed the lives of Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, on October 2 during Yom Kippur. The attack, carried out by 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, is still under investigation by Counter Terrorism Policing North West. In an update on October 24, police highlighted that while over 50 witnesses have been interviewed, they still need to identify additional witnesses captured on CCTV, especially an elderly man with a walking stick and a young child who were present. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts emphasised the importance of speaking to these witnesses not just for the case but also to offer them support after such a traumatic event. Authorities encourage anyone who can assist with the investigation to reach out via the Major Incident Public Portal or call 0161 856 3946. Police presence in the area remains strong to reassure the community, and residents are invited to approach officers with any concerns.
