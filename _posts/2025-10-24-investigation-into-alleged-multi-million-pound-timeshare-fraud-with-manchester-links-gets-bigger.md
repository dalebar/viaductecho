The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has expanded its investigation into an alleged organised crime network accused of scamming people with false timeshare exit services. Hundreds have reportedly fallen victim, with losses estimated in the tens of millions. A prime suspect was arrested at Manchester Airport, and the SFO is now reviewing 24 companies believed to be involved, including several based in Manchester and London. The companies were cold-calling victims, predominantly elderly individuals, offering services for an upfront fee with no results delivered. Many victims were even called again, being pressured to pay more to recover their supposed losses. The SFO urges anyone affected to come forward via its website. Emma Luxton, SFO Director of Operations, acknowledged the sensitive nature of these scams, encouraging victims not to feel embarrassed. The investigation continues with additional arrests and searches, as officials piece together how these fraudsters operated.
