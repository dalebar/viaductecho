For over a century, civil servants in Manchester transformed the city through their work in municipal architecture, from iconic structures like the Toast Rack and Chinatown Arch to essential public services such as wash houses and libraries. The role of city architect, established when Manchester was a pioneering industrial city, was held by figures like Henry Price, who was instrumental in designing many key civic buildings. His successors continued this legacy, contributing to the city’s development through diverse projects, from parks to new civic centres. However, with changes in government policy during the 1980s, the role of the council and city architect diminished, shifting towards private sector involvement. The once-thriving architecture department focused more on maintaining existing structures. The exhibition "Architecture for the People" at Central Library showcases over 350 images celebrating this impactful history, running until February 28. The contributions of those seven city architects have undeniably shaped modern Manchester, making it a unique blend of functionality and beauty.
