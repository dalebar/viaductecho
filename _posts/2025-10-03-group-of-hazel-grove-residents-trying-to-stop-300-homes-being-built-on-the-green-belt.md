Neighbours in Stockport have formed the Hazel Grove Greenbelt Action Group to oppose the construction of up to 300 homes on green belt land. They've written an open letter to Story Homes, claiming the development would lead to an "irreplaceable" loss of green space. With over 1,000 signatures on their petition and a rally attracting over 300 residents, the group's chairman, Steve Birtles, stressed the need for immediate action against developers encroaching on local green spaces. 

While the group supports responsible housebuilding, they criticise the proposed site for its flood risk and weak infrastructure. In response, Story Homes has defended its plans, promising at least 50% affordable housing and commitments to community benefits like improved green spaces and biodiversity measures. The local council is focused on a "brownfield first" policy, aiming for a local development plan ready by November 2026 to address housing needs in Stockport.
