Saturday in Stockport looks pretty damp and breezy. Expect a mix of clouds and rain, with temperatures swinging from 18°C to 12°C. It’s going to be muggy due to high humidity at 82%, and with a 100% chance of rain, you’ll definitely want your waterproofs handy. The south-westerly winds could gust up to 27 mph, adding a chilly bite.

As you head out, be prepared for possible delays if you're commuting—wet roads and reduced visibility may slow things down, so give yourself extra time. Check your windscreen wipers too!

In terms of getting through the day, dress in layers to tackle the unpredictable weather, and don’t forget a waterproof jacket and an umbrella. It might be a good idea to plan for indoor activities, just to keep things enjoyable, despite Mother Nature's efforts! Stay dry out there!
