Owen Dunn, a 24-year-old from Stockport, has been sentenced to over four years in prison for a string of burglaries and robberies alongside accomplice Andrew Hughes, 40. Their crime spree, which kicked off on 19 August 2024, involved stealing e-bikes, motorbikes, and a tent box across Cheshire. Notably, they rammed a 15-year-old off his bike, leaving him with minor injuries. They took over £14,000 worth of items, including two motorcycles and e-bikes from a garage in Frodsham, none of which were recovered. After attempting theft again on 8 September, Cheshire Police apprehended Hughes. Dunn later turned himself in on 19 January 2025 after police tracked him down through evidence found on Hughes' phone and CCTV footage. Both men were sentenced at Chester Crown Court on 2 February after pleading guilty to multiple offences. Police Constable James Wright highlighted the frightening nature of their crimes and expressed hope that the sentences reflect the seriousness of such offences.
