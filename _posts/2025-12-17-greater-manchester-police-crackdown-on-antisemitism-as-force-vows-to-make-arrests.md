Greater Manchester Police (GMP) is ramping up efforts to tackle antisemitism, pledging a stricter approach to hate crimes, especially at demonstrations. This comes after a spike in antisemitic incidents, recent attacks on Jewish sites, and growing community fears. In a joint statement with the Metropolitan Police, they emphasised a tough stance on phrases like "globalise the intifada," often seen at protests. Increased patrols and protective measures are being implemented around synagogues, schools, and community venues. 

Police chiefs acknowledged the ongoing threat and the need for stronger responses in light of recent terrorist attacks targeting Jews. They’re also calling for a review of current public order laws. Their message is clear: they are committed to creating a safer environment for Jewish communities while still allowing for lawful protests. GMP and the Met have urged the public to report incidents and stay engaged with local police, highlighting the importance of community safety during these challenging times.
