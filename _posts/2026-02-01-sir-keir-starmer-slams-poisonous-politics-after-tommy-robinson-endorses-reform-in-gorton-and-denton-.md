Sir Keir Starmer has hit out at the "politics of poisonous division" from Reform UK following their endorsement by far-right activist Tommy Robinson for an upcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton, Greater Manchester. Labour's candidate, Angeliki Stogia, a Manchester city councillor, aims to unite the community and reclaim the seat after Labour previously won it with a strong majority. While Starmer refuses to commit to on-the-ground campaigning, he emphasises that the election is a clear contest between Labour and Reform, stating Labour is the party that can truly foster togetherness and patriotism. Recent polls suggest a potential shift in voter support, with some indicating Reform could gain ground, prompting Green Party leader Zack Polanski to urge action against Reform. Amidst this, local Labour figures like Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham have shown support for Stogia, while also voicing concerns over internal party divisions exacerbated by anonymous briefings.
