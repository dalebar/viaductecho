Leaders of Manchester's Jewish community are responding to the tragic terrorist attack at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, Sydney, where twelve people were killed. This horrific incident, aimed squarely at the Jewish community just as they began celebrating Hanukkah, has left many in Manchester mourning, especially given the recent synagogue attack in Heaton Park. Marc Levy, Chief Executive of the Jewish Representative Council for Greater Manchester, expressed deep concern over the radicalisation driving such violence and the potential for future attacks. Despite fears, he emphasised the community's determination to continue celebrating their heritage, with public menorah lightings still scheduled. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and Australian PM Anthony Albanese condemned the attack, calling it an act of evil and antisemitism, and urged national unity to support the Jewish community during this dark time. Following the attack, police in London are increasing security at Jewish events to ensure safety.
