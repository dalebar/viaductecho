Strong winds are causing disruption across the UK today, particularly affecting Manchester Airport with several flight delays. The Met Office's yellow wind warning, active until 6pm today, spans the south, Midlands, Wales, and parts of the North East and North West, including Greater Manchester. Expect gusts of 45-55mph inland and up to 70mph along coasts and hills. If you're flying today, keep an eye on your flight status and allow extra travel time. Notably, the 7.45pm British Airways flight to London has been cancelled. For updates and stories, you can sign up for the MEN's daily newsletter or join their WhatsApp group. Stay safe out there!
