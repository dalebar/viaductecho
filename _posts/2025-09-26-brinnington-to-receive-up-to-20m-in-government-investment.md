Brinnington, a suburb in Stockport, is set to receive £20 million from the government as part of a £5 billion package aimed at revitalising deprived areas across the UK. This initiative, revealed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, encourages local communities to shape their own future, focusing on reviving high streets, parks, and community spaces. With 55 areas in the North West receiving funding, local residents will have the power to influence how the money is spent, aiming to restore neglected locations and tackle issues like boarded-up shops. Other funded areas include Hattersley, Wythenshawe, and parts of Manchester, among others. The government emphasises community control, stating that real change comes from those who know their neighbourhoods best. This investment is framed as a commitment to reverse years of decline and support local people in creating vibrant communities. Overall, it's all about giving power back to the locals for a brighter future.
