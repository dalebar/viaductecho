Muslim leaders in Manchester are expressing solidarity with the local Jewish community following a stabbing incident outside the Heaton Park synagogue during Yom Kippur, which resulted in two deaths and a suspect being shot. The Manchester Council of Mosques, representing over 50 mosques and 80,000 congregants, is urging unity against violence and hatred. Chief Imam Allama Qamaruzzaman Azmi emphasised the importance of maintaining strong ties with Jewish neighbours, highlighting that acts of violence have no place in their city. They are calling for calm and respect during this distressing time, encouraging everyone to stand together and support one another. The message is clear: Manchester must remain a place of peace, mutual respect, and community solidarity, rejecting any attempts to drive division.
