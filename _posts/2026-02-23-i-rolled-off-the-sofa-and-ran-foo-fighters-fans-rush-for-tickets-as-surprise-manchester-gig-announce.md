Excitement was buzzing outside the O2 Ritz as Foo Fighters fans queued for tickets to a surprise gig announced just hours earlier. The show, set for Friday, would only allow ticket sales in person on a first-come-first-served basis, adding to the thrill. With a capacity of only 1,500, eager fans rushed to the venue, sharing stories of their frantic dashes after hearing the news. One couple from North Wales even detoured on their way to Telford just to get in line. Ticket prices were set at £99, and only card payments were accepted. This event is a much more intimate setting compared to their scheduled Liverpool show as part of the Take Cover Tour, making it a rare opportunity for fans. Alongside the anticipation, Foo Fighters recently released a new song and album, raising spirits even more. It’s safe to say, everyone’s feeling giddy about this surprise outing!
