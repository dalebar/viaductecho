Greater Manchester mosques have confirmed that Ramadan starts this evening, February 18, following a 'split start' due to different sightings of the crescent moon. Saudi Arabia announced the moon sighting, but UK astronomers questioned this, stating it wouldn’t be visible in many countries, including the UK. While some mosques adhered to Saudi guidance, others chose to wait for local moon sightings. After a night of observation, it was announced that Ramadan will officially begin on Thursday, February 19, with Manchester Central Mosque confirming the sighting. The New Crescent Society celebrated the successful sighting in the UK despite cloudy weather. Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is a time for fasting, prayer, and charity, and its start varies each year due to the lunar cycle. Last year also experienced a 'split start' as different regions followed varying moon sighting practices, with many communities looking to Saudi Arabia for guidance, while others rely on local sightings or those in their countries of origin.
