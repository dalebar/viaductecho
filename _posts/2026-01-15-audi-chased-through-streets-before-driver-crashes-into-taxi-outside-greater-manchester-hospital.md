A dramatic chase unfolded in south Manchester when police tried to stop a black Audi A3 flagged for no insurance. Instead of pulling over, the driver sped off, leading officers on a pursuit that ended outside Wythenshawe Hospital. After crashing into a taxi, the driver, a 19-year-old, was arrested for several offences including dangerous driving and driving without insurance. Police also discovered over £3,500 worth of Class A drugs in the vehicle, prompting further charges for possession and intent to supply. Thankfully, no one was hurt in the incident. DC Katie Havens from Greater Manchester Police emphasised how this arrest not only brought a dangerous situation to a close safely but also helped tackle drug distribution in the community, showcasing the vital role of traffic enforcement in larger criminal investigations.
