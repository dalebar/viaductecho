A Jet2 flight from Antalya to Manchester saw chaos when a brawl broke out, sparked by two passengers reportedly making racist remarks while heavily intoxicated. After the situation escalated, the plane made an emergency landing in Brussels, where Belgian police removed the pair, who are now banned from flying with Jet2 for life. Video footage showed multiple passengers getting involved in the scuffle, with shouts and one man even placed in a headlock. A stunned witness expressed how shocking the experience was, especially given the presence of children and vulnerable individuals on board. Flight attendants worked hard to calm things down, and passengers celebrated when the disruptive men left the flight. Jet2 has reiterated its zero-tolerance stance on such behaviour and will seek to recover costs related to the diversion.
