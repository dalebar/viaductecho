Three blokes from south Manchester—Ismael Lea South, Otis Thomas, and Richard Ampeh—spent a month running workshops to educate 200 local youths about the dangers of extremism, including incel culture and Islamic extremism. Meeting in neighbourhood mosques, they aimed to empower young minds to recognise and report extremist messages, particularly in light of rising tensions surrounding issues like Palestine. 

Ismael, a youth worker, shares relatable anecdotes and encourages open dialogue, even with kids as young as seven, about tricky topics like racism and community weaknesses. Initial resistance from some local mosques softened after a synagogue attack highlighted the need for this work.

Otis and Richard, founders of the TAP Project—a community interest company focused on African and Caribbean development—back Ismael’s sessions with funding and plans for a documentary on their journey. They emphasise the importance of showcasing local voices and perspectives in addressing these community issues rather than relying on external narratives. The initiative highlights that many within the community are aware and proactive in tackling these challenges, aiming for a positive impact and wider recognition of their efforts.
