From February 14 to February 22, Manchester Piccadilly Station will face major disruption as platforms 1-12 close for essential track and signalling upgrades, effectively halting trains from the south and east. Services will reroute or end at Stockport, and rail replacement buses will be provided. Only platforms 13 and 14 will operate with limited westbound services. Despite the closures, the station will remain open for shops and facilities, and access to the tram stop beneath it will continue as usual. This £8 million investment by Network Rail aims to modernise ageing infrastructure, improving reliability for the 400,000 trains serving the station annually. Key service changes include: Avanti and Cross Country trains terminating at Stockport, with limited services heading to Manchester Airport and Crewe. Various routes from the east and the north will similarly be rerouted or have different terminus stations, with numerous bus and tram services available to aid travel during the closure.
