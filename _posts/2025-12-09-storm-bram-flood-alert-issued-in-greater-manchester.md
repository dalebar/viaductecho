An amber flood alert's been issued for Greater Manchester due to Storm Bram, which brought heavy rain and gusty winds. The Environment Agency has removed the alert for the upper River Irwell but added one for the middle River Mersey, affecting areas like Bramhall, Stockport, Sale, Altrincham, and Urmston. They warn that rising river levels might lead to flooding today, especially in low-lying areas near Micker, Cringle, Sinderland, and Poynton brooks. Other locations at risk include Stretford, Gatley, Cheadle, and Cheadle Hulme. The amber alert for the lower River Irwell covers the rivers Irk and Medlock, as well as Wince and Worsley brooks, with flooding possible in these spots too. The Environment Agency is keeping a close watch on rainfall and river levels, advising folks to avoid low-lying footpaths and bridges near watercourses. Flood warnings aren't expected right now, but conditions are being monitored.
