Dramatic footage from Bolton shows a driver in a Nissan Juke ramming into police cars during a chaotic incident on Plodder Lane. The police tried to block the vehicle, but after getting wedged against a wall, the driver reversed into one police car and sped away, leaving debris scattered on the pavement. The situation is still unclear as Greater Manchester Police hasn’t confirmed the details, but they’ve been approached for a statement. The incident has caught attention online, with over 120,000 views on social media, and local political candidate Jack Khan urged the community to drive safely. Witnesses say the car was found later on.
