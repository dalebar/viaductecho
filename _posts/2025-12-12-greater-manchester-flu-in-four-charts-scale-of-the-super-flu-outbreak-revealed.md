Flu cases are on the rise in Greater Manchester, with an average of 164 patients hospitalised daily last week, and the NHS is under significant strain due to a harsh flu season they describe as the toughest since Covid. The new 'super flu' strain, A(H3N2), has quickly become the dominant type, leading to an early and intense flu outbreak nationwide. In England, flu hospitalisations have jumped 55% in one week, with similar spikes in norovirus cases. Manchester hospitals are feeling the heat, with the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust reporting an increase of flu patients. Bolton and Stockport are also experiencing higher case numbers. Currently, flu patients occupy 5-8% of beds in some hospitals, a stark contrast to the historical average of around 2%. Health officials are urging locals to get vaccinated and take safety precautions like handwashing and avoiding contact with vulnerable individuals if they're unwell.
