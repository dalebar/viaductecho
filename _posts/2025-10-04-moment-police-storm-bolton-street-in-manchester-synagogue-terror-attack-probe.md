Police in Bolton made several arrests following a tragic terror attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall on October 2. This incident left two men dead and four others injured during Yom Kippur. Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, was killed by armed police shortly after the attack, which involved a car crashing into people alongside a stabbing. Witnesses reported seeing armed officers and tactical units raiding a home on Central Avenue in Farnworth, where a man and a woman were taken into custody. Doorbell footage captured the scene as police searched the property and towed a grey Fiat Bravo from outside. Manchester police confirmed that the raids are linked to the synagogue attack, with multiple individuals, including two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, arrested on suspicion of terrorism-related offences. Tributes have been paid to the victims, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, while investigations and searches are ongoing.
