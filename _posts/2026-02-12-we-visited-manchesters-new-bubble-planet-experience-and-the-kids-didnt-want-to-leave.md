Bubble Planet Experience has landed in Manchester, turning Depot Mayfield into a dazzling, interactive attraction full of bubble themed fun! Open until the end of August, it offers ten themed rooms packed with sensory delights, from an LED Room with an aquatic adventure to the playful Bubble Ocean filled with balloons. Kids and groups can dive into the giant Bubble Bath ball pit for a proper giggle. While all ages are welcome, there are rules to keep things safe and enjoyable. 

Tickets are reasonably priced, with discounts for students and seniors, plus options for VIP packages. While the VR experience and cloakroom are extra, the interactive elements provide loads of fun for families. It’s a bit of a trek from Piccadilly, but parking isn’t a bother with local options nearby. Just be aware there's a one-way system, and once you’re through a room, that's it! Overall, it’s a solid outing for families or groups looking for a memorable day out in Manchester.
