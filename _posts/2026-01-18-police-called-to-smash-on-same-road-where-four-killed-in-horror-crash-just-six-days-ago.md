Another car crash happened on Wigan Road in Bolton, just six days after a tragic collision that claimed four lives. Emergency services responded to today's incident involving at least two cars near Beaumont Road, about a mile from last week's crash where a taxi driver and three teenagers lost their lives. Pictures reveal one car significantly damaged with debris scattered across the road. Although police and paramedics were on the scene, it's unclear if anyone was injured this time. The earlier crash had seen a red Seat Leon collide head-on with a taxi, resulting in multiple serious injuries among other passengers. Survivors from that crash, Georgina and Tom Daniels, shared their disbelief at having survived, expressing profound shock at the state of both the wreck and themselves.
