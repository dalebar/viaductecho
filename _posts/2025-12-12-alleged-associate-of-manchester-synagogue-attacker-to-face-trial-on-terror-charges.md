Mohammad Bashir, 31, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, is set to stand trial for allegedly assisting Jihad Al-Shamie, the Manchester synagogue attacker. Bashir faces four terrorism charges, including preparation of terrorist acts and sharing extremist content via WhatsApp in late 2024. He’s accused of driving Al-Shamie to the UK Defence Academy for hostile reconnaissance ahead of the October 2 synagogue attack, where worshippers Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby tragically lost their lives. During his preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey, Bashir confirmed his identity but plans to plead not guilty. His trial is provisionally slated for July 6 at Manchester Crown Court, and he’ll return for a plea hearing on April 17. Bashir was arrested at Manchester Airport on November 27.
