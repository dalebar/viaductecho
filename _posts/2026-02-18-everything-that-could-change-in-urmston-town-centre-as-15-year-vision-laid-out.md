Urmston is gearing up for a major makeover with a new 15-year plan aimed at revitalising the town centre. Trafford Council has launched the "Urmston Plan" to modernise areas like the derelict market site, the library vicinity, and vacant buildings. The blueprint focuses on improving street conditions with new seating and pedestrian crossings. Based on nearly 550 community responses, issues raised include poor upkeep, limited public toilets, and a lack of social spaces for young people. Residents also expressed concerns about congestion and parking, along with a desire for better public transport links like a Metrolink service. Council members, including Liz Patel, stressed the town’s unique charm and community spirit, highlighting that the plan will guide future development and funding. Key projects include enhancements along Higher Road, Flixton Road, and reviving vacant sites for cultural and community use. There’s potential for multi-use developments in various areas, but many sites face complex ownership issues. The council’s aim is to ensure Urmston remains a vibrant hub for both residents and businesses.
