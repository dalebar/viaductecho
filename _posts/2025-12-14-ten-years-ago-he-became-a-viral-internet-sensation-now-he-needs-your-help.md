It's been nearly ten years since the famous 'Creation of Manchester' photo featuring Mike Deveney went viral, capturing him sprawled outside the Arndale centre, reaching for a lager after a night out. Despite his situation, he impressively didn’t spill a drop, earning him a bit of a Mancunian hero status. Fast forward to now, Mike, 57, lost a leg to diabetes three years ago and struggles to travel far, limited by his old electric wheelchair. Photographer Joel Goodman and journalist Roland Hughes have set up a GoFundMe to raise £4,000 to £6,000 for a new high-quality wheelchair that would boost Mike’s mobility. Extra funds will help Diabetes UK and the charity Cavell, supporting nurses. Joel emphasised that Mike deserves this, as he’s brought joy to many across the globe. Roland echoed this sentiment, hoping people will help give back to Mike this Christmas.
