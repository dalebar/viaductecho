St Chad’s C of E primary school in Oldham is considering new 'faith-based' admissions criteria for its oversubscribed slots, aiming for the 2027 intake. Currently, they open up to around 30 kids each year but with more applications than available spots, changes are on the table. The proposed criteria prioritise looked-after children, siblings of current students, churchgoers, those with medical or social needs, and local residents. To qualify as a churchgoer, kids would need confirmation of attending services either 24 times in two years or 12 times in one year. Though St Chad’s insists it’s welcoming to all, reactions from parents have been mixed, with some calling the criteria outdated and expressing concern that it could favour church attendees over local children. The consultation period runs until January 28, and the school is encouraging community feedback to inform their final decision by February 28, 2026. Karen Bramwell, CEO, reassured families that they’re keen to reflect the school's Christian ethos while remaining inclusive.
