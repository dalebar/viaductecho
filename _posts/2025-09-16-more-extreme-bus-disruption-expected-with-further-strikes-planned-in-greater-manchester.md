Bus staff in Greater Manchester are gearing up for more strikes due to a pay dispute. From 19-22 September and again from 30 September to 2 October, about 2,000 drivers from Stagecoach, Metroline Manchester, and First Bus Rochdale will walk out, affecting around two-thirds of bus services, especially in Stockport and South Manchester, including school routes. Unite the Union claims the bus companies have failed to improve a pay offer of 3.2%, which they argue is a pay cut in real terms given the current inflation rate of 4.8%. Union general secretary Sharon Graham highlighted the companies' profitability while prioritising greed over their employees. Meanwhile, TfGM's Danny Vaughan encouraged operators and unions to negotiate to prevent disruption for passengers.
