Primark has acknowledged an incident involving a young boy who got his hand stuck in a lift at their Stockport store in Greater Manchester on December 12. Shoppers and staff quickly came to the boy's aid after hearing a terrifying scream and chaos ensued in the store. A witness described the boy's hand as being trapped in the open lift doors, and another shopper used a metal clothing rail to help free him while contacting emergency services. Thankfully, the North West Ambulance Service and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue were called but didn’t end up attending as the boy was freed before their arrival. Primark's spokesperson expressed regret over the situation, assuring that the safety and wellbeing of customers is their top priority. They've since taken the lift out of service for inspection.
