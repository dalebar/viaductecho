A young man, Michael Heaton, who was believed to be homeless, was found dead in a Manchester city centre car park on December 30. The cause of his death is currently unknown as the coroner's office awaits a post-mortem. Greater Manchester Police noted that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his passing. This tragic event follows the death of 47-year-old Anthony Horn, who was found on Boxing Day near Bridgewater Hall. Friends suggested he may have succumbed to the cold. Anthony, originally from Bury, had been homeless for about 8 to 10 years and estranged from his family. His sister described him as a kind-hearted person who had faced significant struggles over the years.
