This week, a legal challenge is being heard against Greater Manchester's housing masterplan, brought by the campaign group Save Greater Manchester’s Green Belt (SGMGB). They argue that the loss of green belt land under the Places for Everyone (PfE) plan isn’t necessary for the region's growth and should prioritise developing brownfield sites instead. The PfE plan proposes substantial development across nine boroughs, aiming to identify suitable areas for housing and industry until 2039, involving nearly 2,500 hectares of green belt land. Critics highlight that the GMCA significantly reduced proposed green belt additions from 49 to just 19 sites during the plan's examination, claiming the process lacked transparency and legal representation for communities. With over 27,000 residents objecting to the loss, SGMGB's chair Zoe Sherlock expressed frustration over the last-minute policy changes. The legal team representing SGMGB will argue that the GMCA misapplied legal tests regarding green belt designations. The GMCA and local authorities are set to defend their decision at a two-day high court hearing starting Wednesday, October 8.
