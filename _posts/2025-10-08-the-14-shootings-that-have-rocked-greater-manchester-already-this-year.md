In Salford, residents woke to a shocking crime scene after gunshots were fired through a home window on the morning of October 6. Forensics investigated the area, which was cordoned off, while police searched for the suspect behind the 'targeted attack' that occurred just metres from their homes. Fortunately, no injuries were reported. This unsettling event highlights a concerning trend in Greater Manchester, as the region faced at least 14 violent incidents in the first ten months of 2025. Many incidents didnâ€™t result in serious harm, but they continue to raise alarm. From January's taxi shooting in Oldham to multiple firearms discharges in Salford, Chorlton, and other areas, the police remain actively engaged in investigations. Recent incidents included shots fired in Newton Heath and Middleton, with arrests made in several cases. While the violence is alarming, most victims have narrowly escaped serious injury, leaving the community on edge.
