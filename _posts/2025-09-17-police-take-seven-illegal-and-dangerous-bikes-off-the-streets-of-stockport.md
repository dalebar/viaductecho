Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has recently seized seven illegal bikes in Stockport town centre as part of a crackdown on anti-social behaviour. This September, officers focused on areas with high reports of misused or illegally modified bikes, removing five illegal e-bikes and two motorbikes, which have been sent for destruction. The operation, part of GMP's 'Safe4Summer', took place from June to September and aimed to enhance public safety. Inspector Jason Holmwood emphasised the importance of ensuring people can walk freely without the threat of dangerous bikes. He reassured the community that this initiative isn't just a one-off; GMP will keep addressing concerns around illegal biking and anti-social behaviour.
