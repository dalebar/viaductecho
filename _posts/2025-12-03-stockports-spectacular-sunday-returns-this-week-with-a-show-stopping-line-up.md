Stockport's Spectacular Sunday is back on 16th November 2025, from 12pm to 5pm, promising a magical day packed with festive fun and entertainment for everyone. With over 200 performers and 50 free shows, the town centre will come alive as it transforms into a winter wonderland.

Expect a variety of acts, like stilt-walking Christmas Belles and bouncing snowmen, throughout key areas, including Merseyway and Market Place. Highlights include live drawings by local artist Emily Flanagan, the High Flyers’ flying contraption, and Mr Wilson’s Second Liners bringing a New Orleans vibe. There'll be interactive experiences like the Bees! installation and a minuscule disco, alongside performances by musicians and choirs. 

It's all organised by Totally Stockport in partnership with local entities, and best of all, the event is free to attend! For more details and updates, check out www.totallystockport.co.uk. Get ready for a right festive treat!
