Stockport Council’s plans to introduce charges at 25 previously free car parks are facing pushback. Councillors are calling for a pause and investigation into what they term 'procedural failures' in the scheme's implementation. The new fees, decided in a budget meeting earlier this year, have yet to be rolled out. Concerns have been raised about the council allegedly withholding information regarding the selection process for the car parks and the delay in reports related to the scheme. 

Councillor Christine Carrigan expressed frustration over the perceived lack of transparency, while Cllr Matt Wynne highlighted that local suggestions for car parks were overlooked without adequate communication. Charges are set to start at 50p per hour, reaching up to £2.40 for ten hours, potentially alongside resident permits. Cllr Grace Baynham defended the process, linking it to financial pressures that necessitate the changes, as the council needs to save significant funds over the coming years.
