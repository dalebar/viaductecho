Stockport's set to receive a whopping £56.3 million investment aimed at spurring on regeneration in the town centre. Of this, £41.3 million will back Stockport 8, a new neighbourhood bringing 1,300 energy-efficient homes, while £15 million goes towards redeveloping a derelict office block and car park into 245 'age-inclusive' homes. This funding, part of the Greater Manchester Good Growth Fund's £1bn investment across the region, was announced by Mayor Andy Burnham at an event on 20 November. Managed by Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation, this initiative aims to transform underutilised land into vibrant spaces for living and community engagement. Councillor Mark Roberts highlighted the funding as a significant boost for Stockport, promising new jobs and opportunities while ensuring the town centre thrives. Burnham stressed that Greater Manchester is spearheading economic growth, further enhancing its reputation as a success story.
