Rent prices in Manchester are on the up, hitting an average of £1,337 a month as of December 2025, a 3.4% increase from last year. One-bed and studio apartments have seen the biggest jumps, with one-beds averaging £979. Even though annual rental inflation is slowing, prices are still rising due to limited social housing and high demand. Studio flats range from £800 to £1,400, often with less than ideal living conditions. Experts argue the renting system is broken, pushing for mandatory rent caps to curb costs. The upcoming Renters Rights Act aims to protect tenants by limiting rent increases to wage growth or inflation, while also stopping landlords from overcharging and making rental bidding illegal. Greater Manchester's Mayor Andy Burnham is a strong advocate for these changes, highlighting the need for fairer rental practices to ease the cost-of-living squeeze.
