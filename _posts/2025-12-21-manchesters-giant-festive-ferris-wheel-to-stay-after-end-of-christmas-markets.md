The Manchester Christmas Markets are wrapping up on December 22, but don’t worry—the giant Ferris wheel will stick around until January 4, along with market stalls and fairground attractions at Albert Square. Standing at an impressive 50 metres, this eye-catcher has been delighting visitors since November 7. Open daily from 10 am to 9 pm, it’s only closed on Christmas Day, and will be part of the New Year celebrations with special hours on December 31, staying open until 12:30 am on January 1 for a countdown ride. Councillor Pat Karney praised the markets for being busier than ever, welcoming both locals and visitors to enjoy the festive spirit. Jan de Koning from The Giant Wheel Company highlighted the delight of seeing the wheel thrive in its hometown, contributing to the community’s Christmas celebrations. So if you haven’t yet experienced it, there’s still time to hop on for a ride before the festivities end!
