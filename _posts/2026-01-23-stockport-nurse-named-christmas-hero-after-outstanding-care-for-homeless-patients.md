Sheilagh Armstrong, a Stockport nurse, has been honoured as a 'Christmas Hero' for her exceptional care for patients facing homelessness during the festive season. She’s been working at The Wellspring, a charity providing vital healthcare for the homeless, for over a decade. Her role involves treating various health issues and helping vulnerable individuals access services while preventing unnecessary hospital visits. 

Recognised by the Greater Manchester Integrated Care Partnership, Sheilagh builds trust with her patients, advocating for them at appointments and assisting with housing and benefits. While many services reduce their hours over Christmas, The Wellspring stays open year-round, ensuring those in need can receive support. This festive season, they estimated around 100 people would enjoy a full Christmas dinner, with meals delivered to others in temporary accommodation. 

Dr Manisha Kumar, NHS Greater Manchester's Chief Medical Officer, praised Sheilagh as a true hero, emphasising her compassion and commitment in caring for those often overlooked. For more on The Wellspring, check out their website!
