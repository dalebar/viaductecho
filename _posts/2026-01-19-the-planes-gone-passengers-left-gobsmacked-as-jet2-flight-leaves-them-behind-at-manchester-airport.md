Passengers at Manchester Airport were left stunned when a Jet2 flight to Alicante took off without them. A group of around 35 holidaymakers had been waiting in a stairwell for up to 40 minutes after showing their boarding passes, believing they were waiting for a bus or staff to open the doors. Despite having checked in on time, they were informed by an airport worker that the plane had already departed. One passenger, Matt from Denton, expressed disbelief that no headcount was taken before takeoff, making it seem bizarre that multiple people could be left behind. Jet2 has since issued an apology and is investigating the incident as a priority, while arranging alternative flights for the affected customers. They also provided a £10 voucher during the wait. Matt, who was travelling with his son, described the situation as reminiscent of "an episode of Fawlty Towers", emphasising the confusion and frustration experienced.
