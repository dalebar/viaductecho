A dodgy firm in Manchester, Davis Acquisitions Ltd, has been shut down for facilitating unlicensed insolvency activities. It was found to be a front for helping directors dodge proper insolvency processes, having taken over 78 companies previously linked to Save Consultants Ltd. Both companies promised directors a quick way to shed their debts and avoid tough insolvency proceedings, but their services ignored necessary protections for creditors. Davis Acquisitions was liquidated by the High Court on September 30 after failing to cooperate with investigators and misusing multiple addresses. The Insolvency Service's Chief Investigator, David Usher, highlighted that their actions harmed creditors by blocking recovery of owed funds. Official regulations, including needing a licensed practitioner for insolvency work, werenâ€™t followed. The Official Receiver has been appointed as liquidator, aiming to uphold the integrity of the insolvency system.
