Bus services in Greater Manchester are set for major disruption this September as over 2,000 bus drivers from Stagecoach, Metroline Manchester, and First Bus Rochdale strike. Workers rejected a 3.5% pay increase, which they argue fails to compensate for years of low wages amid the cost-of-living crisis. First Bus Rochdale staff have also nixed a 6% raise. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, expressed that while these companies are profitable, their workers are not receiving fair wages. The strikes are scheduled from Friday 19 September to Monday 22 September, leading to potential chaos on the roads and affecting major events, including Manchester United's match against Chelsea and concerts by Peter Kay and Tom Grennan. Unite's regional officer, Colin Hayden, warned that this coordinated action could bring Greater Manchester to a standstill, and while they acknowledge residents' frustrations, the situation stems from the firms' failure to negotiate.
