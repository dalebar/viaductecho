This September, Greater Manchester is set for major bus service disruptions as over 2,000 Unite members, including bus drivers from Stagecoach, Metroline Manchester, and First Bus Rochdale, will strike. The drivers have rejected a 3.5% pay offer, arguing it doesn’t keep pace with inflation or address years of low pay amid the current cost of living crisis. First Bus Rochdale drivers also turned down a 6% offer. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, called out the profitable companies for not offering fair wages. The strikes will occur from 19 to 22 September, likely causing significant travel chaos, impacting many events in the city, including a Manchester United match and concerts. Unite’s regional officer noted the strike's potential to bring Greater Manchester to a standstill but expressed hope for renewed negotiations with the companies for a better pay deal.
