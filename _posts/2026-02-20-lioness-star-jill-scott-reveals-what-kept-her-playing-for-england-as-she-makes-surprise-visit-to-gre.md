Jill Scott, former England footballer, recently dropped in on Reddish North End FC in Stockport to support a campaign aimed at boosting nutrition in grassroots football. The Lioness star, who has deep ties to Greater Manchester and owns Boxx2Boxx café in Northernden, shared her own journey in football, crediting nutritional advice from England manager Sarina Wiegman for extending her career until 2022. Jill emphasised the importance of proper nutrition for young players, linking it to their performance and overall wellbeing. She wants to help the next generation learn about healthy eating, which she believes is crucial for success in football and beyond. During her visit, she helped prepare a healthy meal for the players, highlighted the role of grassroots football in her life, and even refereed a match. Reddish North End FC expressed gratitude for the support from the community and M&S, which has greatly benefited the club and its young members.
