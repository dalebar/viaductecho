Manchester is bidding a heartfelt farewell to iconic musician Gary "Mani" Mounfield today at his funeral. The order of service shared images celebrating his life, including moments with his family. The service starts at 11.30am at Manchester Cathedral, followed by a private committal. Hundreds lined the streets in Heaton Moor as Mani's funeral procession left his home. He passed away peacefully at 63 on November 20, just two years after losing his wife Imelda to cancer. The service features snapshots from their life together and their twin boys, Gene and George. He made a name for himself as the bassist for the Stone Roses and later Primal Scream, starting with the Roses in 1987. His death has triggered an outpouring of grief both locally and worldwide, with many from the music scene expected to pay their respects today in Manchester.
