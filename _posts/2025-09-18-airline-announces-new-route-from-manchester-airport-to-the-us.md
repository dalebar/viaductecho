Aer Lingus is launching a new route from Manchester Airport to Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, starting in April 2026. This new connection is part of an expanded transatlantic summer schedule, bringing the airline’s North American destinations to 26. Passengers will enjoy the benefits of US pre-clearance in Dublin, making arrivals in the US smoother. The Raleigh-Durham service will operate five times a week, reducing to four in winter, with fares starting at €299 each way. This is the first direct link between these cities and Ireland, and the state is known for its stunning outdoor spots, like the Blue Ridge Mountains and beautiful beaches. Aer Lingus plans to boost frequency to existing routes, including Nashville and Indianapolis, enhancing their appeal for North Atlantic travel.
