Exciting plans are in motion for a new food hall at Wythenshawe Civic Centre, right next to the old Peacocks store. If approved, three empty shops will be transformed into a vibrant market space for local food traders, complete with a communal seating area. The designs, crafted by architects IF DO, feature a stylish new façade with trendy tiling and a canopy for outdoor diners. Senior development manager Joel Chandler highlighted that the food hall aims to become a bustling spot for the community and bolster the night-time economy. There's already engagement with potential vendors to bring a variety of cuisines, reflecting what locals want. This project is part of a broader £20m redevelopment of the Civic Centre, including a new culture hub and improvements to public spaces, all aimed at creating more opportunities and attractions for Wythenshawe residents. The planning application is currently open for public feedback, in line with the council's commitment to enhance local amenities as requested by the community.
