There's a fair bit of disruption on Greater Manchester's motorways leading up to Christmas, with closures set from December 16-20. National Highways has announced that five major motorways—the M58, M60, M61, M62, and M67—will see various sections closed, mainly for maintenance. Most closures kick off around 9pm and wrap up by 6am, so best to plan your routes accordingly to avoid any detours.

Here's a quick rundown: the M58 will have multiple closures from Junction 5 and the M60 will see several exit and entry slip road closures at Junctions 1, 6, 7, and 8. The M61 and M67 also have planned closures during this timeframe. Just a heads up to keep you and your wheels moving smoothly this festive season!
