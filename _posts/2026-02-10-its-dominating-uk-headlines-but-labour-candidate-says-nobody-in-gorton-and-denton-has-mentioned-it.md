The Gorton and Denton by-election is heating up, but Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia says voters aren't chatting about the Peter Mandelson controversy linked to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Instead, she reports that people are concerned about everyday issues like the cost of living, the NHS, and community investments. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has called for the PM's resignation over the Mandelson saga, but Stogia hasn’t heard any mention of it while door-knocking. 

Meanwhile, Labour's Culture Secretary, Lisa Nandy, is rallying support for leader Sir Keir Starmer, acknowledging the PM's missteps while emphasizing the need for political change. Starmer defended his leadership during a recent Labour meeting, highlighting his determination to address issues vital to the party's future, including combating the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK. He urged unity within Labour to build a fairer, more inclusive society. Overall, the focus seems to be shifting from scandals to the pressing needs of everyday people.
