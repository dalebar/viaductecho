The Plaza Cinema in Stockport is celebrating its 25th anniversary since re-opening in 2000 after years of uncertainty. Originally opened in 1932, it was a thriving Super Cinema until it transformed into a bingo hall in 1967. Following its closure in 1999, the building faced a bleak future until a dedicated group of volunteers and the Stockport Plaza Trust revived it. Thanks to fundraising efforts and a National Lottery Grant, significant restoration has been carried out. General manager Ted Doan, whoâ€™s been involved since 2006, reflects on the importance of the Plaza to the community, contrasting it with the lost Davenport Theatre nearby. The anniversary will include festive events, like a performance on the original Compton organ and a screening of the musical comedy "Lucky Girl" from 1932. Ted celebrates how the Plaza holds cherished memories for locals, symbolising the community's effort to preserve a beloved heritage site that many consider family.
