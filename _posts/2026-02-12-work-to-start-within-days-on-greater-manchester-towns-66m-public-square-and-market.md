Big changes are on the horizon for Ashton town centre as work is set to kick off next week. Wigan Council has appointed Bethell Civils and Utilities to transform the historic market site and nearby Gerard Street, thanks to a £6.6M local regeneration fund. The project aims to create a new public square and vibrant market area, featuring a mix of diverse traders, events, and community activities once it’s finished. 

Over the next 10 months, expect some disruptions and diversions for motorists as various improvements roll out, like upgrades to car parks and new pedestrian crossings. There's also a focus on sprucing up shop fronts and adding public artworks, with grants available for local businesses. Some shops have already been revamped, and more are lined up for a makeover by spring. The council's goal is to enhance Ashton’s appeal and boost visitor numbers, so while it might be a bit of a hassle for now, the outcome should be well worth it!
