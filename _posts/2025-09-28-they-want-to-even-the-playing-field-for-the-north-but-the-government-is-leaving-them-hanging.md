A year has passed since the launch of the Eton Star Academy project in Oldham, aimed at helping disadvantaged students access top universities. Initially announced with much promise, the scheme has been stalled by the new Labour government's suspension of free school construction. Town hall head Arooj Shah expresses frustration at the wait for government approval. Along with Eton's headteacher, Mr. Henderson, they highlighted local demographic growth and the pressing need for a sixth form to close the educational gap between the North and South. Despite some public skepticism regarding Eton's involvement in an area with high child poverty, there's substantial support for the initiative, particularly its focus on disadvantaged students. Past discussions with the previous government had nearly finalised plans, but the political shift brought uncertainty. Both Coun Shah and Mr. Henderson remain optimistic and assert that the site for the academy is still secured, with ongoing behind-the-scenes conversations. They believe once the government gives the green light, theyâ€™re ready to move swiftly on the project, but for now, the community continues to wait for updates amidst broader regional delays.
