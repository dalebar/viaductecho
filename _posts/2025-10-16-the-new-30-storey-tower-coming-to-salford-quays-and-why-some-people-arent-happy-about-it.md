A new 30-storey tower block is slated for Salford Quays, but locals reckon it's an 'eyesore'. The Salford council has approved the plans for 141 apartments and 171 co-living homes at Clippers Quay, aimed to tackle housing demand. The co-living spaces will be on the lower floors while the apartments are on upper levels. Despite the potential benefits, 164 objections have been raised by residents, citing concerns about the building's design, its fit with the area, and existing transport issues. One resident called it "overdevelopment" and claimed it’s "entirely out of context." While the developer argues the scheme will boost the local economy, there’s no affordable housing included. Instead, they offered £500K to support local projects. Some councillors expressed disappointment at the lack of social housing, especially given the housing crisis in the city. The application passed with 11 votes in favour. The site is near Trafford Road and Exchange Quay Metrolink, with plans for communal amenities like gyms and cafes to foster a sense of community.
