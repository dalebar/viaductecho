Stockport folks, brace yourselves for some wet and wintry weather! The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice, affecting much of the North of England, including Stockport. Expect rain that may turn to snow in higher areas, with up to 5 cm possible above 200 metres and even 10 cm at higher elevations. This all kicks off at 7pm on Thursday, February 12, and will last until midday on Friday, February 13. It could lead to delays on roads and railways, plus a risk of slips and falls on icy paths. If you're heading out, check for any disruptions and consider taking it slow—leave home a bit earlier to avoid any rush. Stick to main roads if you’re walking, as they tend to be safer. Keep an eye on forecasts for any updates. Stay safe out there!
