Big changes are brewing in Stockport, with key issues to watch out for as we head towards 2026. Firstly, there’s a hot debate over plans to build up to 25,000 homes, many on green belt land, sparking protests from groups like Save Bosden Farm. The council has been consulting residents, gathering feedback, but it’s a tricky balance between housing needs and environmental concerns, especially with around 8,000 on the social housing waiting list.

On a brighter note, Stockport's town centre is set for a £56 million regeneration boost, creating a neighbourhood with 1,300 energy-efficient homes, retail, and improved walking and cycling paths.

As for transport, Greek Street will reopen in spring 2026 after bridge repairs, while the Bee Network plans to simplify train fares, introducing a ‘tap and go’ system. These developments will unfold over the next few years, shaping Stockport’s future and enhancing local life. Keep an eye out for these ongoing changes!
