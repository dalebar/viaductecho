Keith and Helen Atkinson from Walmersley are set to receive Bury’s highest honour, the 'freedom of the borough', in early 2026 for their incredible commitment to fostering. Since 1994, they've cared for 31 children, mostly teenagers, providing love and stability. The couple, both retired civil servants, didn’t actively seek fostering; it found them when their daughter brought home two children needing a safe place. What started as a one-night stay evolved into a long-term commitment, leading them to officially foster. They’ve seen improvements in local social services and maintained ties with several former foster children, treating each one like family. Despite their age, they have no plans to retire, continuing to oversee foster care policies in Bury. Coun Lucy Smith praised their life-changing contribution to foster care, highlighting the vital role they play in giving children a sense of safety and support.
