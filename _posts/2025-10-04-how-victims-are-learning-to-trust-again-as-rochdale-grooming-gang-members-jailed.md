Speaking out about trauma after a crime can feel overwhelming for victims, especially for those affected by child sexual exploitation. Recent events highlight Rochdale's past, where a grooming gang was jailed after extensive investigations. Detective Superintendent Alan Clitherow emphasises a victim-first approach, focusing on their pace and comfort, and ensuring they feel supported throughout the often lengthy process. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) works closely with the Saint Maryâ€™s Sexual Assault Referral Centre, where Assistant Directorate Manager Helen Lomax points out the importance of rebuilding trust with victims, given the historical shortcomings of services. They offer comprehensive support without forcing victims to go to court, respecting their choices. Support is accessible to anyone, regardless of whether they wish to involve the police. Survivors receive tailored assistance, including psychological support and help for families affected by disclosures. The overarching message is one of empowerment, assuring victims that help is available when they feel ready to seek it. The ongoing commitment to improve victim services stems from lessons learned, reinforcing the importance of making victims feel heard, believed, and respected.
