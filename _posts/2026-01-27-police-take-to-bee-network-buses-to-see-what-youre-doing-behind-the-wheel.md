Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are upping their game against reckless driving with a new initiative called 'Operation Top Deck'. Officers are patrolling busy routes in Bolton on the Bee Network bus, keeping an eye out for drivers using mobile phones and not wearing seatbelts, both part of the 'Fatal 4' offences linked to serious accidents. The bus’s height makes it easier to spot these sneaky violations, with police bikes and unmarked cars ready to intervene when needed.

Chief Inspector Mike Parker emphasises the importance of awareness around distractions at traffic lights, not just on motorways. The operation is part of the GMCA's ambitious 'Vision Zero' strategy, aiming to cut road deaths by 50% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2040. In just two hours in Bolton, 23 drivers faced fines and points on their licences, including one uninsured driver. GMP is keen for the public to share dash cam footage of dangerous driving through their 'Operation Snap'. Overall, it’s about tightening the screws on road safety across Greater Manchester.
