Victoria Smith, a dedicated employee at Heatons Cats, is fundraising by running a half marathon to support the charity, which has faced tough times recently. So far, she’s raised over £800 for the small rescue and rehoming charity that she holds dear. Victoria highlights the hard work and care that goes into giving cats a second chance, stressing that the charity depends on donations for essentials like food and medical care. With their shop on Manchester Road currently closed for refurbishments, the charity is struggling financially, especially with unexpected veterinary costs. Despite dealing with knee issues from a previous injury, Victoria believes the effort is worth it for the cats’ well-being. She invites everyone to donate to her fundraiser, stating that any contribution helps ensure the cats receive the love and care they need.
