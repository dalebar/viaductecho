Victoria Smith, a dedicated employee at Heatons Cats, is raising funds for the charity after tough times have hit. She's tackling a half marathon and has already raised over Â£800 for this "small but mighty rescue and rehoming charity," which holds a special place in her heart. The charity relies on donations for essentials like food and medical care, especially after facing unexpected costs from a minor infection and emergency vet visits. Their shop on Manchester Road, a key income source, is closed for refurbishments, further straining their finances. Despite recent knee issues, Victoria is determined to push through for the cause. Any donations, however small, will help ensure the cats get the love and care they deserve. You can support her fundraising efforts by donating through the provided link.
