An orchestra is gearing up for a series of free pop-up concerts around Greater Manchester, showcasing performances in quirky spots like libraries and skate parks. One exciting event will take place at Graystone Action Sports skate park in Salford, in partnership with local company From The Other. Following last year's launch of a Music Cafe in every borough, they're expanding to run an extra one in each area starting in early October, with varied times and locations. Stay tuned to BBC Radio Manchester for updates and connect with them on social media!
