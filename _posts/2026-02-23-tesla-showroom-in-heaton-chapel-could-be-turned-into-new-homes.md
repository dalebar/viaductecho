Plans have been submitted to Stockport Council for a redevelopment project at the Tesla showroom site in Heaton Chapel. The proposal aims to build 10 townhouses and 28 apartments, conveniently located near Heaton Chapel railway station. It includes 40 car parking spaces for residents and visitors. The planning application highlights the site's sustainability, asserting it will significantly address Stockport's housing needs. The development would utilise previously developed land, easing pressure on green belt areas. Additionally, around 12 homes may be offered at affordable rates, subject to further viability assessments. With about 9,000 people on Stockport's social housing list, the demand for affordable housing in the borough is pressing. Stockport Council plans to make a decision on the application by April 30.
