Jihad Al-Shamie carried out a tragic attack on Yom Kippur, driving his car into a group of people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester. After hitting the crowd, he stabbed several individuals, resulting in the deaths of two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, while injuring three others. Al-Shamie was shot dead by armed police, who suspected he had a dangerous device, later found to be harmless. He was a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent, raised in the area. His family, including his doctor father, have online ties to conflicting political views. Neighbours shared memories of Al-Shamie, noting his outdoor workouts and family life. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressed surprise at his name, which translates to 'struggle of the Syrian.' Following the attack, police arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of terrorism-related offenses, and a security cordon remains in place around the area.
