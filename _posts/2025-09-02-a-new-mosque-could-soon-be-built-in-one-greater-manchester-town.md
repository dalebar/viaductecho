A new and improved Jalalia Jaame Mosque may soon rise in Rochdale as part of a community legacy project. Since its opening in the 1970s, the mosque has become more popular and is now set for an extension and remodel. Planned upgrades include a first-floor extension, a lift, better common areas, and a small increase in prayer space. The exterior will see a complete redesign with the dome and minaret being replaced for a modern look. Although the car park will shrink from 68 to 62 spaces, bike spaces will be added, and an agreement with a nearby grocer will provide overflow parking. Eco-friendly features are also highlighted, with the building set to boost energy efficiency through better insulation, solar panels, and a rainwater harvesting tank to reduce water usage. Check out the Public Notices Portal for more details on planning applications and changes.
