Rochdale's Jalalia Jaame Mosque is set for a transformation with plans for a new and improved building as part of a community legacy project. Originally built in the 1970s, the mosque aims to expand and remodel to meet local needs. Proposed changes include a first-floor extension, a lift, new stairways, and enhanced common areas, along with a larger prayer space. The exterior will see a modern redesign, replacing the dome and minaret. The car park layout will be updated, reducing spaces from 68 to 62, but will include bicycle parking and an arrangement with a nearby shop for overspill parking. The plans also focus on eco-friendliness, featuring enhanced thermal insulation, solar panels generating 15KW of energy, and a 7500-litre rainwater harvesting tank for WC flushing.
