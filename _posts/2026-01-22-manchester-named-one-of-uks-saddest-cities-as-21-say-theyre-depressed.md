Manchester's just been labelled one of the 'most miserable places in the UK' according to research revealing that 57% of Brits are itching for some sunshine. Norwich tops the list with a quarter of residents feeling genuinely depressed in the dreary mid to late January months, followed by Stoke, Swansea, Manchester, and Edinburgh. A staggering 42% reckon January puts a real dampener on their spirits, largely due to the cold and lack of daylight. British Gas has stepped in with a plan to address this gloom by installing giant SAD lamps in Norwich, aiming to boost morale and illuminate the darkest days. Psychologist Dr Becky Spelman shared that winter can really bring us down, highlighting the importance of comfort, connection, and natural light exposure. She advises being gentle with ourselves during this tough month, promoting the use of SAD lamps, getting outside during the day, and maintaining warm, cozy environments. For those struggling, the NHS offers talking therapies for mental health issues like anxiety and depression, which can provide a vital support network.
