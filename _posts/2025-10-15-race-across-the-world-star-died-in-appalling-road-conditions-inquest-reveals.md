Sam Gardiner, a 24-year-old contestant from Race Across the World, tragically died following a car crash in Gatley on 26 May. An inquest revealed he was driving at 'significant' speed in 'appalling' weather conditions, which contributed to the accident. Sam's car collided with the central kerb after he had been 'overtaking and undertaking'. Despite being taken to hospital, he succumbed to a brain injury. His family expressed their gratitude to the witnesses and emergency services who assisted Sam. They described him as a loyal, funny, and protective son, brother, and nephew, bringing joy and adventure to those around him. Sam had gained a love for travel from his experiences on the show in 2019 and worked as a landscape gardener in Scotland. His family fondly remembers him for his warmth, laughter, and the lasting impressions he left on everyone he met. Theyâ€™re heartbroken but aim to cherish the happy memories of him.
