Sale put on a show by scoring five tries in a brilliant second half, completely outplaying Harlequins on Boxing Day. Things didn't go so well for Quins at their 'Big Game' at Twickenham last weekend, where they faced Bristol and ended up trailing 26-0 at halftime, finishing with a 40-14 loss. For Sale, the starting lineup included Carpenter, O'Flaherty, Du Preez, Louw, Wills, Ford, Quirke, Rodd, Cowan-Dickie, Harper, Bamber, Andrews, Vermeulen, Van Rhyn, and T Curry.
