NHS staff at some Greater Manchester hospitals are being asked to wear face masks to curb the virus spread, especially as flu cases are rising in the region. While Covid-19 rates are low, hospitals are experiencing high demand, with some, like Royal Oldham, reporting patients waiting over 50 hours for a bed. The increase in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adds to the pressure, prompting local health bosses to review infection control measures ahead of the busy Christmas period. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust has already implemented mask-wearing for A&E staff when treating patients with respiratory issues. They emphasised that patient and staff safety is paramount and that precautions will align with national guidelines. Mask-wearing might also be more common in GP surgeries and community pharmacies, although patients aren’t mandated to wear them. NHS Greater Manchester encourages sensible safety practices like handwashing and using tissues for coughs and sneezes, while advising those with flu symptoms to rest and seek medical help when necessary.
