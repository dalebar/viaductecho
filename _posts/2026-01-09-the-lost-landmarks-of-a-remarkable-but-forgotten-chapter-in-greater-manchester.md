In Greater Manchester, the temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries created a wealth of alcohol-free spaces like halls and bars, aiming to promote moderation and improve community well-being. A new book by Andrew Davison, 'The Built Heritage of the Temperance Movement: The Way Out of Darkest England,' highlights the architectural legacy of this movement as Dry January rolls around. The book reveals many historical buildings that have now faded from public memory, showcasing how temperance was linked to various societal issues like health and crime and even influenced Prohibition in the US.

Among the notable structures is Manchester's Grade II-listed Onward House, built in 1903 as a temperance society headquarters. The book also includes other local landmarks, such as former billiard halls now serving different purposes. With over 300 temperance halls once operational across England and strong ties to other social movements, Davison’s work sheds light on a pivotal but often overlooked aspect of English social history, connecting modern readers to the aspirations of their forebears.
