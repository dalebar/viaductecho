Stockport is set to host its annual Vegan Festival on Sunday at the Masonic Guildhall, featuring over 50 vegan traders from near and far. Visitors can enjoy a free pack of Clearspring silken tofu and participate in cookery demos by The Vegetarian Society. The festival will serve a variety of food, including Indian and Mexican street fare, and baked goods. There will also be an informative talk from Advocacy for Pigeons on helping distressed birds. Plus, you can adopt small animals like hamsters and guinea pigs through the charity Tiny Paws MCR. Organiser Victoria Bryceson encourages everyone to immerse themselves in world street food and local artisan produce, with expert talks on veganism and nutrition. The event, run by Miracle's Mission, supports animal welfare and aims to reduce stray populations. It runs from 10:30am to 4:30pm on 15 February, with tickets costing £5 (free for under 16s with an adult), available in advance from the Vegan Events UK website.
