Stockport is buzzing as it gears up to host the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift on July 31, 2027, part of the UK Grand Départs. This event is a massive deal, shining a spotlight on Stockport and attracting millions of viewers worldwide. The race starts in Leeds, heads through Manchester and Stockport, and finishes in Sheffield, with a grand finale in London. 

To celebrate this momentous occasion, all ten host venues lit up the night sky with a yellow beam in the "Tour de Skies" event. There's more to it than just cycling: the organisers are launching the Joy programme to combat inactivity and improve mental health while opening up thousands of volunteer roles for the community. 

Councillor Mark Roberts expressed excitement about this opportunity for Stockport and the chance to inspire the next generation, particularly women and girls, to embrace cycling. British champion Lizzie Deignan also shared her enthusiasm, highlighting how significant the event is for the sport. It's a great way for Stockport to showcase its spirit and charm while boosting local businesses. Keep an eye out for more updates as the event approaches!
