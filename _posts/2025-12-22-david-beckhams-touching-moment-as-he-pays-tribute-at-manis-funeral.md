Sir David Beckham was spotted paying heartfelt respects to music icon Mani at his funeral today in Manchester Cathedral. The Stone Roses bassist, who passed away last month at 63, was remembered by many, including Beckham and his former United teammate Gary Neville. Mani, a devoted Manchester United fan, had deep ties to the city, being born in Crumpsall and raised in Moston and Failsworth. His coffin was draped with a United scarf, and former bandmates Ian Brown and Bobby Gillespie spoke at the service. The coffin, adorned with the iconic 'Bye Bye, Badman' artwork from the Stone Roses' debut album, was carried out by notable figures including Liam Gallagher and other band members. Following the service, a private committal and invite-only wake will take place.
