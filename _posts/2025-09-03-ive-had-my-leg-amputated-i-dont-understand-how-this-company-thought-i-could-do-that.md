Gwyn Williams, 58, from Fallowfield, had his leg amputated below the knee and turned to Wheelfreedom for a hired wheelchair after being discharged from hospital. Once he received a free wheelchair from the council, he contacted Wheelfreedom to return the hired one but was shocked when told heâ€™d need to box it up himself and leave it outside for collection. This left him feeling upset, as he struggled to reassemble the box due to his condition. After Gwyn reached out to the Manchester Evening News, the paper contacted Wheelfreedom, which swiftly arranged for a driver to come to his home to collect and pack the wheelchair. A spokesperson initially claimed Gwyn was informed of the boxing requirement at the start of his rental. However, after apologising to Gwyn, they confirmed that the collection would be handled properly.
