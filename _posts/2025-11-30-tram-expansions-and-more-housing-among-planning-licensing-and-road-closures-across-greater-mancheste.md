This week in Greater Manchester, there are exciting developments on the horizon! Plans for new Metrolink tram lines and stops in both the north and south are stirring up buzz. A potential stop for Manchester Airport’s new £1.3bn Terminal 2 is on the table, along with tram extensions around Middleton that aim to support the new Atom Valley jobs hub. In Bolton, two significant housing projects are moving forward: a proposed 230-home estate on green belt land and a grand plan for 1,450 homes, a new relief road, and a park near the M61. 

Oldham might see a former pub transformed into a 17-bed HMO and a women-only gym. Meanwhile, Salford anticipates 67,000 new homes across the borough over the next 20 years. Stockport's plans include a 17-storey tower replacing The George pub. In Tameside, around 485 new affordable homes may soon be built on council land. Lastly, Altrincham FC looks to expand its fan zone for a better matchday experience. It's all shaping up to make the region come alive!
