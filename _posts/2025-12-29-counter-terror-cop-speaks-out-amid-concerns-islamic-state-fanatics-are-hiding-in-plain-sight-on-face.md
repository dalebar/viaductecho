A top counter-terrorism officer, Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts, voiced concerns about Islamic State supporters spreading hate on Facebook with little consequence, following the conviction of two individuals in a plot to target the Jewish community in Manchester. Walid Saadaoui, one of the convicted, openly posted anti-Semitic content and glorified past terrorist attacks on multiple fake Facebook accounts. Despite warnings from Facebook for violating community standards, his posts continued. Potts highlighted that this case underscores the alarming prevalence of such hatred online and called for better monitoring and removal of such content. He praised undercover operatives who risked their safety during the investigation that disrupted what could have been a catastrophic attack. The Crown Prosecution Service also noted the seriousness of this extremist plot, emphasising the need to protect communities from terrorism. The case has stirred anxiety within the Jewish community, prompting reassurance efforts from law enforcement and partner organisations.
