Claims about housing 800 asylum seekers in St Thomas' Park, Stockport, are false. A fake planning notice circulated online, stating a 'four-storey temporary structure' was under consideration, sparking local outcry. Stockport Council confirmed these notices are illegitimate and are being removed. No genuine planning applications for asylum accommodation have been submitted or approved. Councillors have voiced their frustration, emphasising the need for community unity and calling out attempts to create fear and division. Local leaders are actively removing the fake notices and encouraging residents to verify facts before sharing on social media.
