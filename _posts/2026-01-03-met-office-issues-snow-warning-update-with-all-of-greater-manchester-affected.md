This weekend, Greater Manchester is getting hit with snow and ice, prompting the Met Office to extend a yellow weather warning across the entire region, including Cheshire, Merseyside, and most of Lancashire. The warning kicks in at 3pm on Sunday, lasting until midday on Monday. Snow showers will move in, with 1-3 cm expected, and possibly 5-8 cm in some areas, especially higher inland spots. Drivers and pedestrians are advised to be extra careful, as icy surfaces could cause travel issues. Temperatures are predicted to drop to around -7C overnight on Sunday, barely creeping above freezing on Monday. Stay warm and safe!
