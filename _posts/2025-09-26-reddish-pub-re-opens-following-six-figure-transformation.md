The Carousel pub in Reddish has re-opened after a major renovation. Closed since 8 September for its six-figure makeover, the pub now features a fresh sports section with new TVs, pool tables, and dartboards. The interior is fully revamped, offering a warm vibe with comfy new furnishings, while the outdoor garden has also been updated with cosy lighting and stylish new furniture, perfect for socialising. Manager Catherine Dalton expressed excitement over the new look, hoping to provide a welcoming space for locals of all ages to gather and enjoy flame-grilled food and drinks. The pub aims to be a cherished hub for the community. For more details and bookings, check out The Carousel's website.
