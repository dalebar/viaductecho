Additionally, they're offering an instant win competition called the Leprechaun, featuring a whopping £100,000 prize pot split into smaller cash prizes. Each entry gives you a shot at finding a Leprechaun for instant cash rewards, alongside a chance to enter a grand £10,000 draw on 31st August.

High Peak Comps isn’t just about prizes; they also give back to the community, recently donating food to local animal rescues and food banks.
