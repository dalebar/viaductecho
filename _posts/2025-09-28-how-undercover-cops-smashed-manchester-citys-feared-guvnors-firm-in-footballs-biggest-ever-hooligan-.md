In the late 80s, Manchester City’s notorious hooligan firms, the Guvnors and Young Guvnors, were causing chaos in English football. With City struggling in the Second Division, their violent reputation drew police attention, particularly after events like the Heysel disaster. In response, Greater Manchester Police launched Operation Omega in 1987 to combat the hooligan issue, deploying undercover officers to infiltrate these gangs. Notably, one officer even drove hooligans to matches in disguise. 

After months of surveillance, a major crackdown occurred in February 1988, resulting in 21 arrests, along with the seizure of weapons. Despite this, violence persisted, culminating in clashes between City and United fans. In court, prosecutors highlighted the gangs' violent nature, describing them as organised like businesses. Ultimately, 25 of the 26 accused were convicted for violent disorder, with several receiving prison sentences and football bans. 

Operation Omega's success led to a broader focus on tackling other forms of crime, reshaping GMP’s approach to undercover operations.
