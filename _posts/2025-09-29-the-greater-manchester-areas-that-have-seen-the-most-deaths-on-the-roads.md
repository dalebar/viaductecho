Last year, Oldham had the highest road death toll in Greater Manchester with eight fatalities, while it accounted for 68 of the 259 serious injuries in the area. Across Greater Manchester, there were 51 road deaths and over 1,000 people seriously injured. Nationally, road deaths dropped by 1% to 1,602, but serious injuries remained alarming, prompting the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) to call for urgent road safety measures. They emphasise the rise in fatalities among vulnerable road users, like pedestrians and motorcyclists, and urge for strategies including lower speed limits, better infrastructure, and public education on road safety. Most fatalities involved males, particularly men aged 30-49. Despite the grim statistics, Great Britain remains one of the safest places to drive globally, with 24 deaths per million people.
