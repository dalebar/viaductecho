A discrimination case against Manchester council and ex-chief executive Joanne Roney has been dropped. Ben Rose, a property agent linked to the Weis Group, was seeking £30,000 for alleged racial discrimination based on an email he received from Mark Powell. The email included a derogatory remark about Rose’s ethnicity, which he believed originated from Roney. However, Roney denied any wrongdoing, stating she would never make such comments, and the council stood firm that no evidence supported the claims. After three days of proceedings, Rose discontinued his claim and agreed to cover the council’s £95,000 legal costs. Roney expressed relief at being vindicated, while Rose voiced his disappointment, believing he had acted in good faith based on Powell's email. Powell, meanwhile, described his wording as an “error of judgment” but has not commented further.
