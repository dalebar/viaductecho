A man wanted for murder after the tragic death of 19-year-old Brandon Lee Porter-Kershaw in Bury has fled the UK. Brandon was killed when a red Audi accelerated and struck him on Porritt Street while he was with friends on May 19 last year. He suffered severe head injuries and later died. The police initially arrested a 38-year-old man but he was released on bail. They then turned their attention to 23-year-old Tino Williams, who is also wanted in connection with the case. Following appeals and the circulation of his images, it's now believed he has left the UK shortly after Brandon's death. The Greater Manchester Police's manhunt continues, but details on how he managed to escape are unclear. Brandon's family described him as a gentle, kind-hearted young dad who was a “ray of sunshine,” leaving behind a young daughter. They have requested privacy as they grieve the loss of their beloved son.
