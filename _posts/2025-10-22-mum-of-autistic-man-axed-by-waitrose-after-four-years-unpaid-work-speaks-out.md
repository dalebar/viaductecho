Frances Boyd has spoken out about her son Tom, 27, who has autism and worked unpaid for over four years at a Waitrose in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. Tom, who was eager to belong and contribute, racked up over 600 hours stacking shelves as part of his work experience. When his family sought paid work for him, they were met with a cold response, stating he couldn't do the full role. Frances shared that while they initially felt hopeful after being told to check back later, communication went silent, and Tom's placement was ultimately ended without notice. She hopes to shed light on unfair volunteering policies for disabled individuals, noting they aren't protected under the Equality Act. While she’s been offered legal support, Frances just wants Tom back at Waitrose, and they’re now exploring opportunities at other supermarkets. A Waitrose spokesperson reiterated their commitment to inclusivity and is investigating the matter.
