Jihad Al-Shamie, the man behind a synagogue attack in Heaton Park, left a voicemail to a woman he married in an Islamic ceremony, expressing longing for her children and pleading to be his 'second wife.' In the message, he admits to feelings of anger and remorse, claiming he misses the children and professing his love for her. He falsely promised heâ€™d move closer to her, offering support while describing their rocky relationship, which had seen him admit to already being married with a child. The woman, who met Al-Shamie on a Muslim dating site, revealed how their relationship oscillated between kindness and abuse, with him pressuring her into a marriage. Following the attack, which claimed the lives of two individuals, it was disclosed that Al-Shamie was on police bail for a separate incident and possibly influenced by extremist ideologies. His voicemail highlights the contradictory nature of his persona, from being caring to manipulative, as he despaired over his unraveling lies.
