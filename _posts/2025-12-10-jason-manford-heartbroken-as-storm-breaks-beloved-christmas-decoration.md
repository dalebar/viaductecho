Jason Manford's festive spirit took a hit as a storm wrecked his cherished outdoor Christmas decoration—a massive nutcracker statue. The Salford comic found the towering figure toppled outside his Stockport home, with one of its arms snapped off, leaving him 'heartbroken'.

Fans quickly jumped in with light-hearted advice and cheeky comments, suggesting fixes like superglue or even repairs on a popular show. Despite the mishap, Jason's sense of humour shone through as he shared his disappointment.
