A new 'league table' has ranked NHS trusts in Greater Manchester based on criteria like financial performance, patient access, and A&E delays. The top performer is The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, placing third nationally, followed by Bolton NHS Foundation Trust and Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust, both tied at 59th. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust is 71st, while Stockport NHS Foundation Trust sits at 86th, and Wrightington, Wigan, and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust is at 92nd. The Northern Care Alliance Trust is the lowest at 116th. 

In non-acute rankings, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust was one of the lowest at 58 out of 61, while Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust ranked higher at 35 out of 60. North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust topped ambulance trusts in England. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasised the need for transparency to improve the NHS. Many trusts expressed commitment to enhancing care and responding to feedback to achieve better rankings.
