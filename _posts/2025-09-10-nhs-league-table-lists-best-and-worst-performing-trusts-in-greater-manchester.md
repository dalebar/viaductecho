A recent 'league table' ranking has revealed the performance of NHS trusts in Greater Manchester. The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, renowned for its cancer care, topped the local list at third nationally. Bolton NHS Foundation Trust and Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust followed, both sitting at 59th. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust ranked 71st, while Stockport NHS Foundation Trust and Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust placed 86th and 92nd, respectively. The Northern Care Alliance Trust was the lowest in the region, at 116th out of 134.

For non-acute services, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust was among the lowest in the country, at 58th out of 61, while Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust performed better at 35th. North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust was rated the best in England.

The rankings aim to increase transparency and encourage improvement across trusts, with poorly performing trusts facing financial consequences for management. Overall, the initiative seeks to drive better care standards for patients.
