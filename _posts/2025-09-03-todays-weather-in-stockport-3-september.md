Today in Stockport, it’s a classic cloudy and damp autumn day, with a 100% chance of rain. Expect mild temperatures peaking at 19°C and dipping to around 14°C, but the breeze from the 21mph winds might make it feel a tad cooler. Humidity will be high at 84%, adding to that typical British chill. 

If you're commuting, maybe leave a bit earlier to dodge potential delays, and consider waterproof gear to keep dry. For the day ahead, it’s best to stick with indoor plans if you can. If you have to head out, be sure to grab your raincoat and protect any electronics from the wet weather. Keep an eye on any weather alerts for extra safety!
