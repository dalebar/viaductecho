Stockport’s weather on Sunday is looking pretty grim, with cloudy skies and non-stop rain expected. Temperatures will hover between 7°C and 13°C, feeling a bit nippy due to high humidity at 87% and brisk winds reaching 23 mph. Definitely a day to pack your waterproofs, as there’s a 100% chance of rain. 

If you’re out and about, the roads might be slippery, so drive carefully and keep an eye on public transport updates for possible delays. Best to stick to indoor plans if you can, but if you must venture outside, layer up with windproof gear and sturdy shoes. Stay dry and warm, and keep checking for any changes in the weather throughout the day!
