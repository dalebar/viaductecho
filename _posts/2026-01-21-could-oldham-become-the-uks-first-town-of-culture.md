Oldham's council is mulling a bid to become the UK's first 'Town of Culture' and snag a £3.5m prize. St James councillor Josh Charters is keen on showcasing the borough's rich cultural history, from the iconic Oldham Coliseum to the legendary Pennine Sound Studios where Joy Division recorded. He believes this bid could elevate local pride and inspire young people to engage in culture. Coun Peter Dean, the council’s Culture and Leisure Cabinet Member, acknowledges the opportunity and confirms that they’re seriously considering applying, thanks to Oldham's strong cultural scene and investments in regeneration. The competition, launched by Lisa Nandy last October, aims to include areas beyond just cities, with the first winner set to be announced for a cultural programme in 2028. A final decision on the bid is pending discussion with the Oldham Cultural Partnership Board.
