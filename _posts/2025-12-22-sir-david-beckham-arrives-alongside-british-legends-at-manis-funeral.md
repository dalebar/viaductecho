Sir David Beckham was spotted arriving at Manchester Cathedral for the funeral of Gar 'Mani' Mounfield, famed bassist of the Stone Roses and Primal Scream, who passed away peacefully last month at 63. The service is set for 11.30am today (December 22), with many famous faces in attendance, including Gary Neville, Bez from the Happy Mondays, Paul Weller, and members of Oasis and Joy Division. Peter Hook spoke fondly of Mani, calling him "the smartest man." Singer Rowetta Idah, visibly emotional, shared how supportive Mani was to her, emphasising his greatness as a father and role model to his twin sons, Gene and George. Mani's death comes nearly two years after losing his wife, Imelda, to cancer, with whom he campaigned for awareness. The couple’s legacy lives on through their twins, who were born in January 2013.
