A person is receiving treatment for serious injuries after a shooting in Trafford tonight. Armed police and emergency services rushed to Higher Road in Urmston around 8.40pm, closing off the area near the railway station. Witnesses described a ripped puffa jacket on the pavement, which indicated someone had been treated at the scene. Greater Manchester Police confirmed they received reports of gunfire shortly after 8.40pm. A scene remains in place, with Higher Road cordoned off and additional patrols in the vicinity. They're seeking any info, CCTV, or dashcam footage that could help the investigation.
