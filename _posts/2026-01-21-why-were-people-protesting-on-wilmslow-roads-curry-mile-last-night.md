Last night on Curry Mile, tensions flared between Kurdish protesters and Syrian residents following a protest march about ISIS prisoners escaping in Syria. Police were called to manage the situation after cars were damaged and fights broke out. Authorities imposed a dispersal order to restore calm. Despite initial peaceful protests, things turned chaotic when some demonstrators clashed with local Syrians. Coun Rabnawaz Akbar urged for peace, stressing that such conflicts should not spill over into Manchester's streets, especially in diverse areas like Rusholme. GMP confirmed they did not make any arrests but are reviewing CCTV to identify those involved in the disorder. The protest was largely peaceful until a group turned hostile, prompting a robust police response. Anyone with info is encouraged to contact the police.
