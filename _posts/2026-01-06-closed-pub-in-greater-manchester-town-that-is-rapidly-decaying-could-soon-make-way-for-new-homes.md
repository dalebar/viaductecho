The Pegs Langtern pub in Ashton, closed since November 2025, is set for demolition to make way for nine new semi-detached homes. McCabe Ltd has submitted plans for the two-storey houses, featuring two to three bedrooms, private gardens, and driveways. The design aims to blend in with the local area, enhancing community safety and visual interest along St Albans Avenue and nearby streets. Planning documents highlight the proposal’s adherence to local and national policies, promoting it as a sustainable development that addresses the need for new housing while also tidying up the decaying site. The project seems to be a positive move for the community in Ashton-under-Lyne.
