Major road closures in Prestwich town centre are set to begin on Monday, October 13, as part of a £100m regeneration project. Fairfax Road and Rectory Lane will be closed to traffic from 7am to 5pm on weekdays for about nine months to facilitate construction and large steel deliveries. Roads will reopen for weekends but will close again on Mondays. The council assures that pedestrian access will remain available, and diversions will be clearly signposted. Bury Council leader, Coun Eamonn O’Brien, emphasised the necessity of these closures for safety and efficient project delivery. Local access to Longfield Centre car park from Rectory Lane will still be in place. Project manager Hugh Taylor added that while complications are expected in a built-up area, the closures are crucial for ensuring the project's safety and effectiveness. The new travel hub promises over 300 parking spaces and is vital for the community's future. The council appreciates local patience during this transformative phase.
