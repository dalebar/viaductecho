Holidaymakers had to be evacuated from an easyJet flight at Manchester Airport on Saturday morning as emergency services rushed to the scene. The flight, EZY 2029, was about to take off for Lanzarote when a tug vehicle, used for moving planes on the ground, accidentally hit the front wheels of the aircraft. Thankfully, no passengers were injured. They were moved back to the terminal while safety checks were conducted, and easyJet arranged for another plane to take over the flight. The airport confirmed that, despite one gate being out of action, the incident didnâ€™t disrupt other flights. An easyJet spokesperson reassured everyone that emergency services were there as a precaution and prioritised safety. They apologised for the delay and provided refreshments for the stranded passengers.
