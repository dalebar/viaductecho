Andy Burnham is backing the idea of providing free bus passes to homeless children in Manchester as part of the Manchester Evening News’ campaign. The aim is to help kids in temporary accommodation that’s over a 30-minute walk from school, as current government rules mean only those living more than two miles away qualify for free travel. Many homeless families in the city face the tough choice of paying for buses or relocating schools. Burnham stated the need is clear and is discussing how to implement this as budgets are sorted for the new financial year. The campaign gained traction after Manchester council unanimously supported it, with various MPs and charities also advocating for the change. The proposal was introduced by Green Party leader Coun Astrid Johnson, highlighting the importance of a united approach to ease the financial stress on local councils. Burnham also mentioned prioritising temporary accommodation passes and support for carers. The M.E.N. has been praised for bringing attention to the challenges faced by families in temporary housing.
