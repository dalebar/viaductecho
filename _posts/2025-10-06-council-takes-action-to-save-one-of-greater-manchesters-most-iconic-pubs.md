The Crescent, a landmark Grade II listed pub in Salford, has been ordered urgent repairs by Salford City Council due to its shocking state after sitting empty for eight years. Once a popular ale institution, it’s now in disrepair, with issues like a collapsing basement and asbestos. The council is taking legal action as repairs must be made or they’ll step in and bill the owners. A £2m restoration plan led by owner Kevin Liu aims to revive the pub as The Red Dragon, while also proposing to build apartments to fund the project. However, plans faced setbacks after concerns raised by Historic England led to a withdrawn application. The council’s Urgent Works Notice aims to stabilise the building's structure, while they work with the owner, who’s keen to proceed but has faced delays with investment. Both the council and Historic England emphasise the importance of preserving this historic site for future generations.
