Georgina Daniels, 28, from Bolton, reflects on the horrific night of January 11, when she and her husband Tom, also 28, were involved in a devastating taxi crash that claimed four lives. Just seven months into their marriage, they were out celebrating friends heading to Australia when a head-on collision with a Seat Leon occurred. Despite the chaos and loss, miraculously, they and two other passengers survived, albeit with serious injuries requiring multiple surgeries. 

Georgina recalls the trauma vividly, stating the experience has been emotionally and physically taxing. Their lives have changed drastically, facing uncertainty regarding long-term care and mounting medical bills. A fundraiser has raised over £30,000 to help cover costs not covered by insurance. 

The couple, who have always been close, now face recovery apart due to their injuries, adding to the emotional strain. With no clear path to healing, they’re trying to stay positive and take things one day at a time, yearning for a return to normalcy.
