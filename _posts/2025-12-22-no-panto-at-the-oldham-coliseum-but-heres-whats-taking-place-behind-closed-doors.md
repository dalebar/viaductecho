The Oldham Coliseum Theatre remains closed this Panto season for the third consecutive year, with hopes for a reopening now pushed to 2026. Originally shut after losing Arts Council funding due to financial mismanagement, the venue, a local favourite for almost 130 years, is under renovation with significant structural work ongoing, including new roofing and essential safety upgrades. The Oldham Council has committed £10m to restore the site, though progress has faced delays. They’re also planning a revamped entrance to improve accessibility. Meanwhile, the Coliseum’s production house is still active, staging 'A Christmas Fair' at Chadderton Town Hall until January 2, promising festive fun despite the theatre's closure. Local officials emphasize the importance of getting the restoration right rather than rushing for an early opening date, and future operations may evolve into a cooperative model to ensure sustainability. While there's no confirmation on a specific reopening timeline, many in the community remain hopeful for a festive return.
