Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has announced his intention to return to Westminster as a Labour MP by seeking selection in the Gorton and Denton by-election. He’s applying for approval from the Labour Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) following former MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation due to health issues. Burnham, who served as Leigh's Labour MP before becoming mayor, may face a challenge for the candidacy from party insiders concerned about a leadership rivalry with Keir Starmer. He assures that if elected, his aim will be to support the Government rather than undermine it. Burnham emphasised his commitment to addressing public concerns and fostering unity, drawing parallels between his mayoral success and the political landscape in Greater Manchester. The selection process is underway, with a deadline for applications looming. If successful, he would have to resign as mayor, potentially triggering another mayoral by-election. The by-election could coincide with local elections on May 7.
