The Prime Minister has praised the courage of those involved in the Manchester synagogue terror attack, which occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish Calendar, preventing a potentially worse disaster. Two people lost their lives, and four are critically injured, including a security guard, while the suspect was shot by police. PM Rishi Sunak commended the bravery of emergency responders, security staff, and worshippers, particularly Rabbi Daniel Walker, who barricaded the synagogue doors to protect congregants. He emphasised the rising threat of antisemitism in Britain and extended condolences to the victims' families. Greater Manchester Police Chief Sir Stephen Watson confirmed that quick actions from all involved stopped the attacker from entering the building. Witnesses hailed Rabbi Walker as a hero for his calm leadership in a frightening situation.
