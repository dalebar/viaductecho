Today in Stockport, expect a cloudy, drizzly autumn day with a 100% chance of rain. Temperatures will be mild, peaking at 19°C and dipping to around 14°C, so dress appropriately! Humidity is set to be high at 84%, and winds are blowing around 21mph, making it feel cooler. 

For commuters, it might be wise to leave a bit earlier to avoid potential delays from the rain. Waterproof clothing and sturdy footwear are a must to stay dry. 

If you can, plan for indoor activities, but if you're heading out, be sure to bring your rain gear and protect any electronics from the wet weather. Keep an eye on local updates for any weather warnings throughout the day.
