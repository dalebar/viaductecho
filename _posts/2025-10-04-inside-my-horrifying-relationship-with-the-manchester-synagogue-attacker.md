A young woman has shared her harrowing experience of being groomed into a controlling relationship with the Manchester synagogue terrorist, Al-Shamie. The relationship, which lasted four months, was marked by extreme views and abuse. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions on her family, met Al-Shamie on a dating app and soon discovered he had lied about his age and relationship status, hiding his three children and ex-wife. She described how he pressured her to wear traditional coverings and pushed extremist beliefs, even suggesting he wanted to join ISIS. Concerned for her safety, she ended the relationship after witnessing his erratic behaviour. Despite changing addresses and blocking him, Al-Shamie continued to stalk her.
