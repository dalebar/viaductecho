Ricky Hatton, the beloved former world champion boxer, tragically passed away at his home in Hyde, Tameside, sparking a wave of tributes from fans and the sporting community. At 46, Hatton was deeply cherished in Greater Manchester for his heartfelt connection to the city, his passion for Manchester City FC, and his generous spirit. Tributes highlight not only his boxing prowess but also personal anecdotes showcasing his character. Former Manchester Evening News writer Dominic King shared a humorous story of Hatton’s optimism after a phone theft, reflecting his personality. Hatton enjoyed writing a weekly column during his rise in 2005, despite light-heartedly believing it jinxed his team's fortunes. His impact and vibrant presence were felt deeply, with heartfelt remembrances noted at recent events like the Manchester derby. King encapsulated the sentiment beautifully: “What a brilliant lad he was to be around. What a tragedy his light has gone out. Rest in peace, Ricky."
