The government’s announced £7.3 billion investment for local roads over the next four years, with Greater Manchester set to receive £15.6 million next year. The funding aims to tackle potholes and enhance road maintenance, with the North West getting a total of £800 million. Rachel Reeves highlighted the commitment to fixing an extra million potholes yearly, doubling the previous budget. However, councils need to publish clear data on pothole repairs and follow best practices to access the funding, as the Treasury is putting more emphasis on transparency. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stressed this is the biggest investment in road maintenance to genuinely fix the UK's roads for the long haul. Each local authority can prioritise repairs based on needs, with the extra funding contingent on their compliance with data transparency.
