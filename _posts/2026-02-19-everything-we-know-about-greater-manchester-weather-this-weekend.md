This weekend in the North West, expect cloudy and unsettled weather with occasional rain or showers. Today (Thursday), any early rain should ease off, leading to a mostly dry, cloudy afternoon with some sun creeping through. It’ll stay chilly but with lighter winds. As we head into Friday, a dry evening will give way to showers overnight, turning to heavier rain by morning—particularly in higher areas. The weekend brings milder air, yet it'll still be mostly cloudy with frequent rain and some heavy bursts. Overall, temperatures will be above average for this time of year, with a mix of rain, drizzle, and the odd drier spell. Greater Manchester can expect a bit more rain compared to the eastern regions. Just a typical Mancunian weekend, really!
