Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander lauded Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's dedication to the region amid speculation about his return to Parliament following MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation. Gwynne's departure, due to health issues, prompts a by-election and has reignited discussions about Burnham possibly vying for leadership against Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Alexander expressed her sadness for Gwynne and his constituents, while indicating her strong collaboration with Burnham on enhancing rail services, particularly through plans for the Northern Powerhouse Rail initiative. This vision includes a new Liverpool-Manchester line aimed at slashing journey times to just 35 minutes. Alexander emphasised the need for improved rail services in the north, committing £1 billion over the next four years to this cause. She also hinted at the possibility of an underground station at Manchester Piccadilly, pending further viability tests. Overall, she's enthusiastic about boosting northern rail connections, believing that investment in this infrastructure is vital for economic growth.
