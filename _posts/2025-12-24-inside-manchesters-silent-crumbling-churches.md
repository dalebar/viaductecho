Church attendance in the UK has been on the decline since WWII, dropping from 15% in 1948 to less than half of the population identifying as Christian in 2021. Despite a recent uptick in belief among young people, many churches are now left abandoned or underutilised. Notable examples include Moss Side Unitarian Church and All Souls Church in Ancoats, both facing deterioration and potential demolition. Moss Side closed in 1947 and now stands as a half-demolished wreck, while All Souls, a Grade II listed building, remains unsold and in disrepair after closing in 1984. The Primitive Methodist Church in Ardwick has vanished from sight, replaced with empty land, and Philips Park Cemetery Chapel, opened in 1866, is sadly crumbling after 25 years of vacancy. Many of these historical structures are struggling to find new purpose amid changing societal values, highlighting the challenges of preserving our architectural heritage as communities evolve.
