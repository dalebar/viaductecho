A 52-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a string of violent robberies targeting women in Manchester, Salford, and Bury. Over ten incidents occurred between August 24 and September 3, where the suspect would approach women in public and forcibly steal their handbags, sometimes dragging victims to the ground. Police caught him in Crumpsall after he acted suspiciously and attempted to flee when spotted. Detective Inspector Natasha Feerick emphasised the seriousness of these offences and the importance of public safety, thanking victims for reporting these crimes. Local police are committed to tackling crime and ensuring community safety. Fortunately, none of the victims needed hospital treatment, but understandably, they were shaken up by the incidents.
