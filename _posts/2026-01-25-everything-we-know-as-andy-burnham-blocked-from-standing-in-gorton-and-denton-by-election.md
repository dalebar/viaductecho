Andy Burnham has been barred from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election by Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC). They’re worried about the potential costs and disruptions of a mayoral by-election in Greater Manchester if he steps down. This decision, made by a sub-group led by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, aims to preserve party resources ahead of local and devolved elections, emphasising that it’s crucial to maintain Labour’s control in the area. The move has stirred up some controversy, with senior figures like Lucy Powell and Ed Miliband pushing for grassroots input on candidate selection. Some MPs are miffed, worried this could jeopardise Labour’s chances in the by-election, especially with stiff competition from Reform UK and the Green Party. However, others back the NEC, arguing that speculation about Burnham’s candidacy is causing division and that it’s time to focus on unity and the campaign. Supporters of the decision reckon it provides clarity for Labour to move forward and present a united front to voters.
