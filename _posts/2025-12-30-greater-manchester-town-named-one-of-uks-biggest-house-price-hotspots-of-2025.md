Wigan's making waves as one of the UK's top property hotspots for 2025, sitting pretty at number three, with house prices up 10.5% to an average of £249,562. Plymouth and Stafford lead the pack, jumping by 12.6% and 12% respectively. Wakefield and Mansfield are also in the mix, while Stockport suffered a 4.7% decline, making it one of the biggest fallers. In the south, Crawley and High Wycombe saw steep drops of 8.9% and 7.4%. Overall, most regions experienced growth, with Northern Ireland enjoying a 5.8% rise, but London barely budged with a slight 0.1% dip. Amanda Bryden from Lloyds highlights the importance of picking a community that feels right for you, as that's just as vital as the numbers! If you’re on the lookout for a new pad, she suggests doing a bit of research on specific locations, especially where the north and Scotland remain more affordable.
