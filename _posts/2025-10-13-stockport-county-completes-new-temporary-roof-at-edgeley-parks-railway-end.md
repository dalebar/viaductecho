Edgeley Park has got a new temporary roof at the Railway End, which previously had no cover. This upgrade will keep fans dry and enhance their matchday experience, especially for away supporters in the 2025/26 season. The new layout improves access for home fans too, fostering a more connected atmosphere. It meets EFL rules requiring at least 20% of away fan seats to be covered. Gavin Bailey, the club's chief operating officer, expressed delight over the addition, highlighting its benefits like weather protection, better atmosphere, improved segregation, and direct access for away fans. He's optimistic about ongoing developments at Edgeley Park to boost facilities for all supporters.
