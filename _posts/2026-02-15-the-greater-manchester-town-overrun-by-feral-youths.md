A troubling situation is unfolding in Ashton-in-Makerfield, where locals like café owner Helen are livestreaming harassment from large groups of teens. Since months, these youths have been causing chaos in the area, throwing items at cars, verbally abusing staff at local businesses, and behaving aggressively towards passers-by. Over the past weekend, a mob of around 50 teens forced a nearby KFC to close early, with disturbing footage gaining over 200,000 views online. Residents report feeling unsafe, especially on weekends, with some saying the teens act like they own the streets, often riding bikes dangerously and throwing objects. Local councillor Danny Fletcher is working with police and schools to address the rising anti-social behaviour, emphasising the need for better community policing. While police have implemented dispersal orders and increased patrols, many locals worry about the lack of respect from the youths and fear for their safety as summer approaches. The situation has raised urgent calls for action to ensure a safer environment for everyone in Ashton.
