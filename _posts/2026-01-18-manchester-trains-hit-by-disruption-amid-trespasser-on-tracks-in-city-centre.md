Rail passengers in Manchester faced disruptions due to a trespass incident on the railway near Castlefield, affecting services between Oxford Road and Deansgate. Initially, trains were blocked but are now running at reduced speeds. Delays are expected to continue into the afternoon, with potential waits of up to 40 minutes. 

National Rail mentioned that all lines have since reopened but advised delays may still occur until around 2:30 PM. Affected passengers can use their tickets on Metrolink and other Northern services at no extra cost. The incident is impacting various routes, including those operated by TransPennine Express, East Midlands Railway, and Transport for Wales. 

Updates will be shared as the situation develops, but trains are gradually returning to schedule.
