Stockport War Memorial Art Gallery is gearing up to celebrate its 100th birthday this autumn! Opened in 1925 to honour those lost in WWI, it’s now a lovely spot for reflection and showcasing local art. To mark the centenary, the gallery will host a special exhibition called "Beautiful Things," featuring submissions from talented artists across the borough. This open exhibition launches on Thursday, 16 October, and aims to highlight Stockport’s vibrant history. Councillor Dan Oliver expressed excitement about the event, noting it’s a great chance for young creatives to share what they find beautiful in their community. The exhibition, alongside festivities like the Carnival of Art, pays tribute to Stockport's rich cultural legacy and promising future.
