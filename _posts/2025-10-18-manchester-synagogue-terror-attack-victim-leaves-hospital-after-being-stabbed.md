Andrew Franks, one of the victims of the recent Manchester synagogue attack, has been discharged from the hospital and is now back home. The attack, which occurred on Yom Kippur, resulted in the tragic deaths of two men, Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, when Jihad Al-Shamie rammed his car into a crowd outside the Heaton Park synagogue in Crumpsall. Al-Shamie attempted to enter the synagogue with a knife before being shot and killed by police. Alongside Franks, Yoni Finlay, 39, who was injured by a police bullet while trying to barricade the synagogue, has also been released. However, a security guard named Bernard remains in hospital after being struck by Al-Shamieâ€™s vehicle. Initially, armed officers feared Al-Shamie had explosives, but it was later confirmed to be non-viable. Despite the attack, the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation has resumed religious services. Al-Shamie, who claimed allegiance to Islamic State, called emergency services during the incident.
