In a shocking incident in north Manchester, two people have died and three are in serious condition after a car ploughed into pedestrians and someone was stabbed outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall. Armed police responded rapidly, confirming that the primary suspect was shot and killed due to safety concerns about suspicious items he had. Witnesses reported seeing two men in handcuffs being escorted away by officers on a nearby residential street, causing a major police operation with multiple armed units, helicopters, and ambulances on site. Local residents were asked to stay indoors as the situation unfolded, with reports of a heavy police presence and a lockdown around the area. The police have declared this a “marauding terror attack” under their emergency protocol. Greater Manchester Police is currently providing updates on the incident.
