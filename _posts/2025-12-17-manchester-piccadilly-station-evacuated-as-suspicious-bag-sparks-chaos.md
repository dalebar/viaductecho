Manchester Piccadilly station was evacuated this morning after reports of a suspicious bag. Police were called around 10am on December 17, and a cordon was set up while they investigated. Thankfully, the bag turned out to be non-suspicious, and the station reopened around 10:30am. However, National Rail warned of potential disruptions until 11:15am, with possible train cancellations or delays. Passengers shared their experiences on social media, expressing concerns but appreciating the efficient response from staff. Overall, it was a tense situation, but safety prevailed in the end.
