Residents of the Seven Sisters tower blocks in Rochdale are facing a lengthy move-out process that could take up to 18 months due to safety concerns highlighted in a recent survey. Initially, tenants were expected to vacate before Christmas, but now only two of the 229 have relocated. Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) is offering support, including financial assistance for moving, and is in discussions with residents about their options. However, some locals are sceptical, suspecting that RBH's intentions might lean towards demolishing the blocks, a move that has faced backlash in the past. There’s been a push from campaign groups like 'Save the Seven Sisters' to resist the move, arguing it feels like a hidden agenda for demolition. RBH insists no decision on the future of the tower blocks has been made yet and continues to work on long-term plans while enhancing support for those affected.
