Councillors in Salford are pressing the council to cut its hefty fees for bulky waste collections, currently starting at £52.50 for up to four items. They argue these costs are driving residents to rogue waste collectors and increasing fly-tipping, which has become a significant issue in the city. Recent discussions highlighted that fees in Salford can be much higher than in other Greater Manchester boroughs—for example, removing a mattress, washing machine, and fridge-freezer could cost £115 here, whereas it's free elsewhere. 

Councillor Stuart Dickman emphasised the financial burden on those without cars, making it harder for them to dispose of large items properly. Other councillors suggested subsidies or even free collections to make the process more resident-friendly. A council report identified over 7,600 fly-tipping incidents last year at a cleanup cost of £400,000, highlighting the environmental and social damage caused. Measures to tackle this issue are being considered, including new CCTV cameras and clearing high-risk areas, with councillors keen on finding solutions to support the community and reduce waste problems.
