Train services between Manchester Victoria and Huddersfield are facing major disruption for several days due to a fire in the Standedge Tunnel, which started on January 25. The tunnel is closed until at least January 29 for extensive repairs after it sustained structural damage. While services on other routes, such as Manchester to Redcar Central and Liverpool Lime Street to Newcastle, are also affected, the Manchester to Huddersfield line is the hardest hit, with many cancellations and delays. Some trains are being rerouted via the Calder Valley, but won’t stop at certain stations. Passengers between Dewsbury and Huddersfield are advised to use a combination of trains and rail replacement buses for their journeys. National Rail is encouraging everyone to check their travel plans and allow extra time, apologising for the inconvenience. They’re working to resolve the situation as swiftly as possible.
