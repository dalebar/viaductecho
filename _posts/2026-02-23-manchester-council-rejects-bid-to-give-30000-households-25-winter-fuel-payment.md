Manchester council has dismissed proposals to up spending on policing fly-tipping and parking issues, alongside a £25 winter fuel plan. As the council prepares to approve its budget on February 27, Labour leaders have introduced various measures following a 24% funding increase from the government, focusing on city clean-up and park maintenance. Opposition councillors, led by John Leech from the Liberal Democrats, suggested amendments aimed at addressing ongoing problems, including a £756,000 cost-of-living payment for eligible households and additional funds for road resurfacing, fly-tipping, and parking enforcement. 

Workers pointed out existing budget measures already addressing some of these proposals, like significant support for cost-of-living and maintenance initiatives. Some amendments, notably those regarding road treatment lapses, were critiqued for potentially leading to higher costs. The opposition's proposals weren't endorsed by the scrutiny committee but will be debated in an upcoming council meeting.
