Angry Ginge, aka Morgan Burtwistle, clinched the top spot in the I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here final, much to the delight of fans and his old schoolmates from Salford City Academy. Having previously studied at Christ Church CE Primary and Northern Primary School, Morgan showed promise during his school years, shining in drama and history while also becoming head boy. His mum shared that he wasn't perfect—he once got in trouble for selling Lucozade at school—but he was diligent with his homework and a supportive friend. His former teachers praised him for his determination and leadership, expressing pride in his triumph. Ginge made history as the first social media star to win the show, securing over half the votes. His mate Jakey from Rochdale had faith in him all along and joked about how Ginge might handle his newfound fame within their friend group. All in all, everyone’s chuffed for Ginge and can’t wait to see how he celebrates this well-deserved win!
