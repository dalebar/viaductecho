Stockport's weather on Sunday will be a mix of sun and clouds, with the temperature starting at 14°C and peaking at 20°C. Expect a bit of rain thanks to a 58% chance of showers, and be ready for breezy conditions with winds around 17 mph. 

As the day's mild temperatures rise, you might enjoy some sunshine, but don’t forget it could get wet. Commuters should keep an umbrella or a light raincoat handy, especially since the wind might sway taller vehicles. Dressing in layers is a smart move to adapt to the changing weather, and staying hydrated is key with the humidity in the air. If you’ve got outdoor plans, waterproof gear will keep you comfortable. Enjoy your Sunday, but stay prepared!
