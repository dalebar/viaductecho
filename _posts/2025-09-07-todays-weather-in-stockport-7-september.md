Sunday in Stockport will be a mixed bag, featuring partly cloudy skies with some rain showers. Expect temperatures between a mild 14°C and a max of 20°C, along with a hefty 73% humidity and a 58% chance of rain. Winds will be brisk at 17 mph, adding a touch of a chill to the air.

The day will kick off pleasantly mild, warming up to around 20°C with some sunny spells. But don’t forget your umbrella, as those rain showers could crop up anytime! If you’re commuting, a light raincoat or umbrella could save you from getting drenched, especially with the wind making things a bit tricky for taller vehicles.

For a comfy day out, layered clothing is the way to go, as you’ll want to adjust based on the weather. And with the humidity in play, staying hydrated is key. So, grab your waterproof gear if you’re heading outside, and make the most of what Stockport has to offer!
