Manchester’s facing a significant homelessness crisis, particularly among refugees like Sivi, who fled Sudan seeking a better life. After receiving leave to remain in the UK, he faced homelessness when he was forced out of Home Office accommodation. Many asylum seekers are given just 28 days to secure work and housing, which is nearly impossible, especially with language barriers. 

Sivi, now sleeping in a tent in Lincoln Square for eight months, describes the harsh conditions and lack of dignity he’s experienced. Since December, over 3,200 refugees have sought help from local charities like Mustard Tree, highlighting a growing need for support in the city. As the backlog of asylum assessments clears, many are left with inadequate time to find employment or accommodation. 

Charities, not primarily focused on refugees, are struggling to cope with this crisis. Manchester’s reputation for kindness draws many refugees, but without the ability to work or train, the situation remains dire.
