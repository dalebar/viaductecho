The FELT exhibition has launched at the Hat Museum in Stockport, focusing on young people's mental health. Featuring the works of 22 artists aged 18-30, the exhibition blends fine art, textiles, sculpture, and photography, all inspired by their experiences with mental health issues. Organised by the Arc Centre, a local charity promoting art and wellbeing, it coincides with Children's Mental Health Week. Many participating artists found creating art therapeutic, with some sharing how it helped them express their feelings during tough times. One artist, Mars, described how art helped simplify overwhelming thoughts, while Yiru's piece aims to encourage connections through shared experiences. The exhibition is open until 14 March, welcoming the public on select days, alongside the charity's ongoing community art initiatives. Overall, the event hopes to raise awareness about mental health and promote open discussions while showcasing the benefits of artistic expression.
