A man's body was found in the River Spodden at Healey Dell nature reserve near Rochdale.

The area close to the viaduct was cordoned off, and the entrance to the park remained shut later in the day. Greater Manchester Police confirmed the recovery of the body but have not released the man’s identity yet. Investigations are still ongoing, with a police presence at the scene. Further details are pending.
