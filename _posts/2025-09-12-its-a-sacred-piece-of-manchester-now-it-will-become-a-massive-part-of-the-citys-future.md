Construction has kicked off at the old Boddingtons Brewery site in Manchester, transforming it into Brewery Gardens with 505 new homes, most of which will be affordable. This project marks the first social housing built in the city centre in 40 years. Led by Latimer and the local council, the development aims to turn the long-derelict site into a vibrant community. Council leader Bev Craig and Mayor Andy Burnham recently visited the site, reflecting on Boddingtons’ significance to the city. The new development will include a mix of housing types: 132 for social rent, 202 for private sale, and more for shared ownership. With plans to add 7,000 homes in the Strangeways area, the project aims to address Manchester’s housing crisis, where many residents are on waiting lists. The brewery's rebirth also coincides with the return of Boddingtons beer, now produced by JW Lees, celebrating the city’s rich brewing history. Completion of the housing project is projected for 2028, aiming to alleviate the housing shortage in Manchester.
