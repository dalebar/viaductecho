The trial of Manchester brothers, Abubakr and Umar Ben Yusaf, accused of causing the death of Rhys Jenkins in a crash, has collapsed after the jury was discharged for legal reasons. Jenkins, a father of two, died in a collision on the A483 last November, while his nine-year-old son suffered severe injuries. Both brothers, locum optometrists from Manchester, denied charges of dangerous driving and have claimed they were not racing when the crash occurred. A new trial is scheduled for June 1, 2026. The case has seen eight days of proceedings at Mold Crown Court, where the prosecution alleged that Abubakr's BMW struck Jenkins' Toyota Yaris after he veered into the wrong lane.
