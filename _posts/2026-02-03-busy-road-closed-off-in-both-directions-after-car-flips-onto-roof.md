Church Street West in Radcliffe was closed this morning following a two-vehicle crash just before 11am, where one car ended up flipped on its roof. Bury Council put a diversion route in place and reminded drivers to allow extra travel time. Thankfully, no injuries have been reported. The road was cordoned off but reopened by 11:45am, with access to Radcliffe Medical Practice remaining unaffected. Police confirmed their response to the incident, and Bury Council shared updates on social media regarding the situation. Everything's back to normal now—Church Street West is fully open again!
