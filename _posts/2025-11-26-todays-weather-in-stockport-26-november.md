Stockport's weather today is all about clouds, with overcast skies dominating the scene. Expect a chilly day, with temperatures peaking at around 8°C but feeling much colder due to a minimum of -1°C. High humidity at 86% will give things a damp feel, and there’s a solid 77% chance of rain in the late afternoon, so be prepared for a wet spell. Winds will be quite brisk at 17 mph, adding to that nippy vibe. If you’re commuting, it might be wise to allow a bit of extra time due to potential rain affecting traffic. Make sure to wear waterproof gear and consider staying indoors if you can, as it’s a perfect day for snuggling up rather than braving the drizzle! Stay warm and dry!
