Local leaders in Greater Manchester are worried that Andy Burnham's tense relationship with the government, particularly after his clashes with Keir Starmer, could hurt investment in the region. Despite Burnham's claims of supporting the Prime Minister and committing to his mayoral duties, he hasn't dismissed the idea of challenging Starmer. His recent comments have drawn criticism, even from his own party, with some likening him to Liz Truss. Local politicians fear this friction could hinder government support for vital projects, including the long-awaited Northern Powerhouse Rail and the Manchester Baccalaureate initiative. They don't expect outright project cancellations but worry ministers may shy away from backing Burnham to avoid further conflict. A Labour source noted the pressing need to rebuild relationships with the government to strengthen devolution efforts. Meanwhile, the Labour Party announced support for the Victoria North development, which will create 15,000 homes and marks a positive step amidst ongoing tensions.
