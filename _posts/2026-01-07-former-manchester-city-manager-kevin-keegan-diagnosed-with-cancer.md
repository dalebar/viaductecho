Kevin Keegan, the former Manchester City and England manager, has been diagnosed with cancer, as announced by his family. The 74-year-old was recently hospitalised for ongoing abdominal issues, leading to this diagnosis. They've expressed gratitude for the medical team's care and requested privacy during this tough time. 

Keegan’s football journey began at Scunthorpe before moving to Liverpool, where he enjoyed tremendous success, winning multiple league titles and cups, as well as being named European Footballer of the Year twice while at Hamburg. He earned 63 England caps, played in the 1982 World Cup, and captained the national team. 

Keegan's managerial career kicked off at Newcastle, where he led them to the Premier League and nearly secured the 1996 title. Following stints at Fulham and England, he managed Manchester City briefly before an emotional return to Newcastle in 2008, which ended after eight months amidst board tensions.
