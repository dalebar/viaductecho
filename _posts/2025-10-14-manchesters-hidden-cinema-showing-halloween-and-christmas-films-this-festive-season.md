There's a hidden gem in Manchester's King Street Townhouse – a quaint mini cinema that accommodates 20 for a super snug viewing experience. They're showing a mix of Halloween and Christmas classics like Hocus Pocus, Nightmare on Elm Street, Love Actually, and How The Grinch Stole Christmas. Screenings run from October 27 to November 2, then on weekends and daily in December up to Christmas Eve. Tickets are flying off the shelves! Options include just the film or bundles with snacks, afternoon teas, and cocktails. The full menu features popcorn, pizzas, burgers, and more. Fancy a special occasion? You can book the whole cinema for events like baby showers or enjoy a cinema and spa package, which includes a spa treatment and brunch! Ticket prices range from £15 for the film alone to £65 for a complete package. For those eager to join in, check the website and Eventbrite for schedules and booking info. Don’t miss out on the festive fun!
