A major recruitment drive is underway in Greater Manchester to find the next wave of prison and probation officers, part of the Government's ‘Plan for Change’ aimed at reducing crime and enhancing community safety. The campaign encourages individuals from diverse backgrounds, especially men, to explore careers in this field. Lord James Timpson, the Minister for Prisons and Probation, highlighted the commitment of staff at Manchester's Probation Service and stressed the impactful nature of this work. Barry Saunders, a probation officer, described the role as a chance to facilitate positive change for offenders, while Dean Arnold, from HMP Manchester, shared his rewarding experience in the prison service. The campaign runs through autumn, offering roles across Greater Manchester with full training and flexible entry routes for both graduates and seasoned professionals. Interested candidates are encouraged to apply and be part of this crucial mission.
