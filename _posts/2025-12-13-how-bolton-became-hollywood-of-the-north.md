Bolton has officially launched its own film office to make the most of its ‘Hollywood of the North’ fame, thanks to its charming Victorian and neoclassical architecture. The town's unique look has attracted loads of film and TV shoots, with productions like Peaky Blinders and Happy Valley taking advantage of its cobbled streets and stunning locations. The new Bolton Film Office aims to bolster this reputation by promoting affordable filming options with local talent while encouraging community involvement and film tourism. Recent years have brought a flurry of activity, with Bolton seeing 95 productions and over 370 days of filming since 2020. The launch event featured industry experts discussing the town's appeal, highlighting its versatility across different genres. Popular spots include Le Mans Crescent and the old magistrates’ court, with many productions showcasing their historic charm. Coun Nadeem Ayub emphasised that the film office would continue to enhance Bolton's cultural significance and keep it thriving in the filming spotlight.
