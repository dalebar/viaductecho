Greater Manchester Police have nabbed 20 individuals for various offences like knife possession, drug dealing, and serious violence as part of Operation Venture, aimed at tackling violent crime in Stockport since August. Police employed high-visibility patrols and community insights to both deter and respond to incidents. During the operation, they executed 43 stop and searches, leading to the seizure of weapons, drugs, Â£4,050 in cash, and 18 vehicles. Notably, officers quickly apprehended a suspect after a woman was run over by her ex, and seized a significant stash of drugs and a large knife from another individual trying to flee. Sergeant Mohammed Waqas highlighted the importance of community cooperation in enhancing safety, stating that every action, from arrests to seizures, contributes to making local areas safer.
