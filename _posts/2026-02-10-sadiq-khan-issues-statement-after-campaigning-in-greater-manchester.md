Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, campaigned for Labour's Angeliki Stogia in the Gorton and Denton by-election, framing it as a choice between "hope and fear." During his visit on February 9, he championed local community spirit at Grounded MCR CIC café, highlighting the essence of Manchester's unity. Khan warned against the divisive politics of Reform, stressing that this election impacts not just Gorton and Denton but the entire country. Stogia echoed his sentiments, expressing pride in her city and commitment to unity over division. She aims to address local issues and foster community pride, reflecting her deep connection to Manchester after over 30 years of living there.
