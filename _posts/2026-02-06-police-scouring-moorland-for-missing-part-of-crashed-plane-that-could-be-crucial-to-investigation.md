Police in Rochdale are investigating a plane crash that claimed the lives of two men on February 3. Emergency services were called after a light aircraft, the Cirrus SR20, crashed near Blackstone Edge, about 40 minutes after taking off from Birmingham. Both men were pronounced dead at the scene, and no one else was on board or injured. Authorities are looking into the crash's cause, with a deployed parachute, now stuck to a pylon, as a crucial part of the investigation. 

Police have issued a warning not to touch a missing parachute component containing propellant, which hasn't been located yet. This small device is red, measures about 10cm in diameter and 30cm long, and weighs under 2 kg. They urge anyone who finds it to contact them immediately. Greater Manchester Police is appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward by calling 101 or using their Live Chat service, referencing log number 1056 from February 3.
