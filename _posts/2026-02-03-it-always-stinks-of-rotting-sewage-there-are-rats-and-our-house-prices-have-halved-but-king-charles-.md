Residents near a massive illegal dump in Bickershaw, Wigan, have called on King Charles to help clear the toxic waste affecting their lives and property values. The site, described as the 'UK's worst illegal dump', contains over 25,000 tonnes of rubbish, including household waste and hazardous materials. Locals report a foul smell and a rat infestation, which have led to their house prices plummeting, with one resident’s property dropping from £170,000 to £88,000. Homeowners feel neglected by Wigan Council and the Environment Agency, believing earlier action could have prevented the current crisis. The Duchy of Lancaster, part of King Charles's land, is exempt from clean-up duties due to outdated laws, frustrating locals who feel accountability is lacking. While the council has initiated closure orders and a criminal investigation is underway, residents claim the response has been delayed and inadequate. They’re urging stronger government support and a collective effort to tackle the issue, as the smell and vermin continue to disrupt their lives.
