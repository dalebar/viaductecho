Julius Goncarukas, 42, has been sentenced after alarming the Jewish community by brandishing a fake gun from his car in Salford. On August 2, 2025, as he drove down Welbeck Grove, adults and children fled in fear upon seeing him with a BB gun. Following multiple 999 calls, police arrested him nearby and recovered the imitation firearm from his car. Though he initially stayed silent in his police interview, he later admitted to waving the gun around. Goncarukas received a 16-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, after confessing to possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear. The sentence included an uplift due to the hate element of the crime. Additionally, he has been ordered to undergo 15 days of rehabilitation and comply with 90 days of alcohol monitoring. Daniya Alvi from the Crown Prosecution Service emphasised that there’s no place for hate in society and vouched for justice against such actions.
