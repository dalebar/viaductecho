Flood warnings and alerts are still active across Greater Manchester following a heavy downpour on Saturday. On Sunday morning, there's nine flood warnings and five alerts, signalling expected or possible flooding. The Environment Agency is keeping an eye on the situation, though water levels are stabilising now that the rain has stopped. Areas affected include the rivers Irwell and Mersey, as well as parts of south and north Manchester. Timperley Brook in Altrincham has a warning, with Green Lane and Canal Road identified as higher-risk spots. Stockport and the Worsley area of Salford are also under caution, alongside parts of Lancashire and Cheshire. The Met Office forecasts a dry and bright Sunday ahead.
