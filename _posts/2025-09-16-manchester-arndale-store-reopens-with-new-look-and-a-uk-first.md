Lush has reopened its store in the Arndale after a major refurbishment, making it even more popular than before. On Monday, it was the first in the UK and Ireland to launch this year’s Christmas collection, featuring a special area for the much-loved Snow Fairy range, which outsells any other location. This year, new Snow Fairy products include a pink Scrubbee, a Super Milk hair primer, and a miniature candle. Along with Halloween goodies like a Pumpkin Spice body spray and Alien Egg Farm shower jelly, the revamped store boasts a 'Fragrance Greenhouse' for autumn, Halloween, and Christmas scents, along with a complimentary fragrance reading service. A new makeup counter showcases Lush’s vegan Firework collection, alongside tailored consultations. The reopening drew plenty of local support, and upcoming events include bath bomb making. Plus, a city-exclusive Bee tote bag is available, with 50% of proceeds going to Real Change MCR, helping those facing homelessness in Manchester. It’s all about that community spirit!
