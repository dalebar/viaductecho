Police in Manchester have provided an update after a Britain First march and several counter-protests took place on February 21. The far-right group gathered near Piccadilly station, advocating for “remigration and mass deportations,” while groups like Resist Britain First and Stand Up To Racism Manchester organised counter-demonstrations. To manage the situation, a significant police operation led to 11 arrests. Among those arrested, one man has been charged with breaching a dispersal notice, while others were released without charge or bailed on various public order offences or assaults on emergency workers. A dispersal order was also implemented in the city centre to ensure safety. Assistant Chief Constable Rick Jackson commended the police response, stating that the planned protests and football matches were handled well, allowing various groups to express their views safely. He highlighted Manchester's commitment to peaceful protest while ensuring the safety of residents and visitors.
