Police in Salford are looking for 32-year-old Dominic McDaid, who failed to show up at Chester Crown Court for sentencing on drug-related offences. He lives on Walker Road in Eccles and is described as a white man with a heavy build, short brown hair, and blue eyes. If you’ve got any info on where he might be, give Cheshire Police a shout at 101 or visit their website, mentioning the reference number 26000061918.
