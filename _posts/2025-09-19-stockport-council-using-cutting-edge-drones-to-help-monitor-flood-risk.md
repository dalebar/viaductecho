This initiative has already aided safety along the Goyt Valley footpath and is a collaboration with Wilde Consultants, which has also created local jobs and supported young engineers. The project has received recognition, earning a spot on the shortlist for the Best Use of Technology Award 2025 by the Local Council Roads Innovation Group. Cllr Grace Baynham expressed excitement over the nominations, highlighting the council's commitment to community safety and a greener future through innovative partnerships.
