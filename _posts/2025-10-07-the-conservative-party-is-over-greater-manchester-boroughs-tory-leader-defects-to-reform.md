Councillor Jack Rydeheard, the Conservative leader of Bury council, has quit the party and joined Reform UK, claiming that "the Conservative Party is over" and only Reform can enact the necessary changes for Britain. This move comes after a turbulent year for Bury's Tories, who have seen their numbers dwindle from 10 to just 5 members. Other recent defectors have left to sit as Independents. Rydeheard, who has represented Elton since 2022, expressed that after almost a decade with the Conservatives, he feels they no longer align with his values. He praised the Bury Conservative members but believes Reform UK offers a bold plan to address issues like immigration and local government spending. The announcement coincides with the Conservatives' annual conference in Manchester, and Reform UK has welcomed Rydeheard, highlighting their commitment to integrity and meaningful change.
