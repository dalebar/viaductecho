Manchester City Council is dealing with a £9.1m overspend for 2025/26, largely due to escalating costs in children’s social care. Despite this financial pressure, the council has just revealed an ambitious local plan for the next 15 years, aiming to build almost 60,000 new homes, including a requirement for 30% to be affordable. This comes alongside exciting proposals for 100 miles of floating walkways along the River Irwell, part of the CyanLines initiative that aims to enhance connections between the city’s parks and waterways. Costing at least £100m, these vibrant walkways are still in the conceptual stage. Meanwhile, the council’s finance boss highlighted challenges including a shortage of foster carers and increased demands that affect children's placements. While the Local Government grant is the best seen in 15 years, the council is actively seeking ways to manage the overspend, which, if unaddressed, could tap into reserves by year-end. Overall, the city remains committed to its development goals, with a strong push for sustainability and community focus.
