A three-year-old boy named Oliver has made impressive progress after being the first person with Hunter syndrome to undergo innovative gene therapy at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. His family from California chose this treatment, which is a significant step beyond the existing, costly medication, Elaprase. While Elaprase can slow physical symptoms, it doesn’t address cognitive issues due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. 

Oliver's cells were sent to Great Ormond Street Hospital for processing, and he has regular follow-ups every three months back in Manchester to monitor the therapy's effects. The groundbreaking work was led by researchers at the University of Manchester, specifically by Prof Brian Bigger, who spent over 15 years developing this gene therapy. It’s a heartwarming story of hope and advancement in medical science!
