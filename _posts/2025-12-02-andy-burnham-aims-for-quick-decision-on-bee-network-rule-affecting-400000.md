Andy Burnham’s set to make a quick decision on a bus pass rule impacting hundreds of thousands of Bee Network passengers. Currently, disabled and older pass holders can't use their passes before 9:30am or after midnight on weekdays. But this rule was trialled twice this year to see its effect on the network. The first trial was in August, and after positive feedback, a second trial ran through November, the network's busiest month.

Burnham announced that while the November trial ends soon, he’s keen to reach a permanent solution quickly. So far, there haven't been significant issues reported with the temporary rule lift, which is promising for those advocating for change. A permanent lift could help tackle accessibility concerns and allow the elderly to engage better with their communities and attend important appointments. Age UK representatives have highlighted the importance of this initiative for ensuring older individuals remain active and connected. A decision is expected in December so folks can get some clarity moving into the new year.
