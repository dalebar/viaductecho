Ofsted's recent inspections have covered various educational facilities in Greater Manchester, reporting their findings the week of November 24, 2025. Oldham College received a rating of 'requires improvement,' but showed significant progress in curriculum redesign and student support. Rochdale Islamic Academy and Safe Start School also got 'requires improvement' ratings, with concerns about undeveloped curriculums and inconsistencies in teaching methods. While progress was noted, both faced challenges, particularly in supporting pupils' learning effectively. Meanwhile, Wigan Council's children’s services received praise for their improvements since May 2022, achieving a 'good' rating with a strong emphasis on child-centred practices, though some areas still needed work. Notably, no inspection reports were published for Manchester, Bolton, Trafford, Stockport, or Salford this week.
