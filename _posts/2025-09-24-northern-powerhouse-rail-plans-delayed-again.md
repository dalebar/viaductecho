Plans to extend high-speed rail in northern England are facing further delays and won’t be revealed by the Prime Minister at the Labour Party conference next week. It’s been reported that the Department of Transport has put a plan to the Treasury, aiming to secure up to £1.5bn for preparatory work set to kick off around 2030. A key concern is whether linking Manchester Airport to the city centre, part of the Northern Powerhouse Rail and similar to the scrapped HS2 Phase 2, offers good value for money. The Treasury has yet to comment on these developments.
