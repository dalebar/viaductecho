James Binks has stepped down as the chief executive of Rochdale council amid allegations of ‘inappropriate behaviour’. He was suspended last month during an investigation by Manchester City Council, where he previously worked. It's reported that he received no payout as he left under normal terms. Julie Murphy, the corporate services director, has taken over as interim chief executive while the council looks for a new permanent replacement. The council leader, Neil Emmott, suspended Binks to protect the council’s reputation following media scrutiny. In his communication to council members, he expressed the importance of upholding the organisation's values. While Binks has apologised for his actions during the incident, he asserts that any implication of sexual misconduct is untrue. The recruitment process for a new chief executive will now begin.
