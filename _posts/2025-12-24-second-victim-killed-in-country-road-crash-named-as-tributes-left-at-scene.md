Dawn Reed is the second woman who tragically lost her life after being struck by a car in Bolton. The incident occurred on Scout Road, where both she and 59-year-old Vicki Attenborough, a local Green Party branch secretary, were hit by a VW Polo early on December 22. Emergency services arrived but unfortunately, both women died at the scene. Touching tributes have poured in, highlighting their vibrant personalities and love for life. Vicki was not only a dedicated environmentalist and involved in local campaigns, but she also had a close-knit family, with her absence profoundly felt by them. Her involvement in the community and commitment to social justice have been widely recognised, leaving a significant impact. A 19-year-old driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing their deaths by dangerous driving, and Greater Manchester Police are seeking information related to the incident.
