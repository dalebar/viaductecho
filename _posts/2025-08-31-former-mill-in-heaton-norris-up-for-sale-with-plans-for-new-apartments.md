A former mill in Heaton Norris, known as the Ropeworks, is up for sale with planning permission for 34 new homes, including four houses and 30 apartments. The 10,000 sq ft building, located on Stanbank Street, has been empty and suffered some damage since initial conversion plans were approved in 2016. After a previous developer's plans fell through in 2020, new permission was granted in Summer 2024, and the site is now listed by Landwood Group. The development aims to preserve the original facade while revitalising the structure, which is ideally situated for residential use, close to Manchester Road. Potential buyers are invited to submit offers, but no price has been set yet.
