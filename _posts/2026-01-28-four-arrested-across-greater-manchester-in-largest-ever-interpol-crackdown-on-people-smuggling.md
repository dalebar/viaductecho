Four individuals in Greater Manchester were arrested during INTERPOL's largest-ever operation aimed at tackling people smuggling and human trafficking, dubbed Operation Liberterra III. Spearheaded by the NCA's Joint International Crime Centre, the operation targeted offenders who had illegally entered the UK. Among those detained was a 38-year-old Iraqi man wanted for rape in Germany and a 41-year-old Syrian man linked to illegal boat crossings. Additionally, a 23-year-old Ukrainian and a 31-year-old Romanian man were arrested for sexual exploitation. Nationally, other arrests included a Syrian man wanted for child rape in Liverpool and an Egyptian man wanted for murder in Bedfordshire. Overall, the operation resulted in 3,744 arrests worldwide, with 1,800 related to human trafficking. NCA Deputy Director Rick Jones expressed pride in the UK's role, highlighting international cooperation and the ongoing extradition processes to ensure justice for serious offenders.
