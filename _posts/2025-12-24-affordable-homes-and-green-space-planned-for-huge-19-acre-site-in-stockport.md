Bellway has submitted a planning application for 176 new homes on a 19-acre site at Jacksons Lane in Hazel Grove, Stockport. Half of these will be affordable housing. The development will also introduce new open public green space. This comes as part of the Stockport Local Plan, which earmarks land for residential use. The homes will vary in size, including two to four-bedroom properties, and will retain existing hedgerows, mature trees, and ponds, alongside new native plants to boost local biodiversity. There'll be wildlife habitats created too, including bat and bird boxes.

Sebastian Burrow from Bellway highlighted the project's sustainability, noting it’s close to local amenities like shops and schools, encouraging walking and cycling with new pedestrian links. The plans also include contributions towards improving local infrastructure, such as schools and healthcare. Overall, this project aims to meet local housing needs while supporting the development of balanced communities in Stockport.
