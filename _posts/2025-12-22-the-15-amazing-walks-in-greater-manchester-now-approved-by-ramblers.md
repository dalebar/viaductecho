Over a dozen walks in Greater Manchester have been relaunched by the Manchester and Salford Ramblers, now branded as the 'Manchester Green Trail.' Originally established in 2012, these trails span 67.2 miles and connect green spaces like parks, rivers, and canals throughout the city. Starting from Chapel Street park in Levenshulme, the route meanders north to Heaton Park and south through the city centre to Wythenshawe. The initiative aims to encourage more folks to enjoy the health benefits of walking in urban areas. With backing from the council, it's all about getting people out into nature to explore local areas, making outdoor activity a part of everyday life in Manchester. The relaunch includes improved maps and resources, helping everyone discover Manchester’s green gems. You can grab PDFs for each trail from the Ramblers' website.
