Emma Martin is turning her traumatic experience into a mission to help other domestic abuse survivors after her ex-husband, Nicholas Martin, attempted to murder her by setting their home on fire. Following his 30-year sentence, Emma managed to escape the blaze with serious injuries, including broken ankles and PTSD. Despite her struggles, she’s making “fantastic progress” in recovery and has returned to work. Emma now collaborates with charities like White Ribbon UK and Women’s Aid, aiming to support others and raise awareness about domestic abuse. She emphasizes the importance of sharing her experiences to help those in similar situations and is excited about her new charity engagements. Emma is also reconnecting with family after the isolation inflicted by her ex’s abusive behaviour. Grateful for the support she's received, she feels empowered and hopeful for the future, declaring, "This definitely feels like this is my year."
