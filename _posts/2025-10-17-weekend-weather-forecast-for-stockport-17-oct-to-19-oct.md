This weekend in Stockport looks a bit of a mixed bag. Friday kicks things off with some lovely partly cloudy skies, highs of 13°C and no rain, perfect for getting out and about. Saturday leans towards more cloud, with temps between 10°C and 13°C, and a slight chance of rain but stronger winds making it feel a tad chillier. 

Then there's Sunday, which isn't looking fab at all—cloudy with rain nearly guaranteed, highs of 15°C and strong winds up to 28mph. If you’re commuting, Friday and Saturday should be fairly smooth, but brace yourself for a wet and windy Sunday that may slow things down a bit. 

Best bet? Get your outdoor plans in for Friday, maybe Saturday as well if you don’t mind the clouds. But for Sunday, maybe stick to indoor activities or don your waterproofs if you’ve got to brave the outdoors. Stay safe and enjoy your weekend!
