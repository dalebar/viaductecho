Two lanes on the M62 eastbound are closed this morning due to flooding between junctions 11 (Birchwood) and 12 (Eccles Interchange). The closures began around 3am and traffic is currently queuing for about three miles leading up to the affected area. There's also one lane shut on the westbound side because of the same issue. Highways workers are on site dealing with the situation, and motorway cameras indicate flooding near the hard shoulder. Motorists are advised to take care as they approach the closure.
