Stockport is set to welcome a vibrant new neighbourhood in Stopford Park, featuring 442 homes across three buildings, including the newly topped-out Bosden block with 62 homes. The development, located near the railway station and Wellington Road, aims to enhance access to local transport, jobs, and leisure facilities. Council leader Mark Roberts highlighted that this project is about more than just homes; it's about creating a modern urban area that respects Stockport’s heritage. Residents can also look forward to a landscaped art park for relaxation. Future plans include 258 apartments in the 16-storey Lyme building and 122 build-to-rent homes in Torkington. The historic Stockport Arts College will be transformed into a workspace and social hub called Cheers and Smith. Cityheart's development director, Greg Ball, acknowledged the challenges of developing on brownfield sites but emphasised the excitement around Stockport's future and the importance of public-private partnerships in navigating financial hurdles. Residents could start moving into Bosden as early as next year.
