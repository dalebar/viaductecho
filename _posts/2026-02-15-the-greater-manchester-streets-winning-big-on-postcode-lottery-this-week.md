Ten streets in Greater Manchester have had a lucky week, winning big in the People’s Postcode Lottery. Since February 8, a number of players have each pocketed £1,000 from the draws. To join in, folks need to sign up their postcode and pay a monthly fee of £12.25. The lottery has raised over £1 billion for UK charities since 2005, donating 33% of ticket sales. 

In a standout win, NHS worker Lisa Waller and her husband Nigel scooped nearly £154,000 on Valentine’s Day, sharing £1 million with their neighbours in Rotherham after their postcode bagged the weekly Millionaire Street prize. 

While the biggest wins were outside Greater Manchester, local winners include postcodes M32 9HP (Stretford), WN3 4TN (Wigan), OL16 2PE (Rochdale), and several others that won £1,000 each. Quite the streak of good fortune!
