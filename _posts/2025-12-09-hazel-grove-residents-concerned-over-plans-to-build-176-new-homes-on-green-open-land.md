Residents in Hazel Grove, Stockport, are worried about plans from Bellway Homes to build 176 new homes on green land south of Jacksons Lane. Though half of the properties would be affordable housing, locals fear increased traffic and the loss of important green space. Long-time resident Erika Morgan, 94, expressed concern about the negative impact on the community, while Adele Shaw, 51, highlighted the importance of the area for family activities. Bellway claims the development will include accessible green spaces and promote walking and cycling, with construction potentially beginning in 2028 and lasting up to eight years. The area is classified as part of Stockport's green belt, raising concerns about the implications of further development in the region.
