Altay Bayindir will keep his spot as Manchester Unitedâ€™s goalkeeper for the derby against City this Sunday, according to head coach Ruben Amorim. He mentioned that new signing Senne Lammens has the potential to become the first choice in the future. Unfortunately, Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha, and Diogo Dalot will miss the match due to injuries. Interestingly, United has included at least one academy graduate in every first-team matchday squad since 1937.
