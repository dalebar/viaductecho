Agita Cica, a 27-year-old woman, has been banned from all John Lewis stores in England and Wales after stealing £2,400 worth of designer fragrances from the Cheadle branch. She was caught in August 2024 during a series of organised thefts and provided false information to the police. After failing to appear in court and evading arrest for over a year, she turned herself in to Northumbria Police in November 2025. Cica pleaded guilty to four counts of theft at Newcastle Magistrates' Court in December 2025, resulting in a 12-month ban from all John Lewis stores. Police Constable Kenneally emphasised that her actions were not spontaneous but rather calculated, highlighting the serious impact of shoplifting on retailers and honest shoppers alike.
