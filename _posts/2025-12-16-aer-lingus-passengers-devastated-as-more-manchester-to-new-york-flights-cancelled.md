Aer Lingus passengers flying from Manchester to New York are facing significant travel disruptions due to multiple flight cancellations. The airline recently cancelled several direct flights from December 3-7, citing "aircraft technical issues," with further cancellations affecting the EI45 flight on December 12, 14, and 16. Passengers have expressed frustration, with reports of confusion at the airport, where some were notified of cancellations only upon arrival, despite being able to check in online.

One family drove two hours to find their December 14 flight cancelled and opted not to rebook due to their short trip. Others, like Judith from North Wales, were put up in hotels after their flights were unexpectedly cancelled. The disruptions come amid possible plans for Aer Lingus to close its Manchester operating base, putting over 200 staff at risk, and following strike actions over pay discrepancies. Many affected passengers are now seeking compensation, but reports suggest they are facing challenges in communicating with the airline.
