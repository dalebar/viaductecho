Salford is gearing up for some exciting changes to enhance walking and cycling around the city. New routes are being developed to encourage more active travel, especially in busy residential and commuter areas. A fresh number 30 bus route will link the Trafford Centre to Manchester, easing some parking and traffic woes in Salford.

The council is set to invest £4m in upgrading roads in Ordsall, focusing on key improvements like new toucan crossings for cyclists and pedestrians, dedicated cycle lanes, and traffic calming measures. Various streets, including Eccles New Road, Howard Street, and King William Street, will see upgrades for safer pedestrian access and better traffic flow. Plans also include widened footpaths, raised junctions, and improved drainage on Hulton Street.

Overall, these developments are part of the council's vision for a greener, healthier Salford, fostering better movement and connectivity throughout the area. It’s a positive step towards making the city more vibrant for residents and visitors alike!
