Boxing Day in Greater Manchester brings a bit of a rubbish problem as folks deal with leftover wrapping paper and festive waste. Luckily, councils have set out revised bin collection schedules for the holiday period. Most towns are adjusting collection dates due to the Christmas and New Year’s bank holidays, with a big emphasis on recycling. 

Tameside, Bury, Oldham, Manchester, Rochdale, Stockport, Salford, Trafford, Wigan, and Bolton each have their own collection changes, like delayed pickups for Christmas Day bins to later dates. For instance, Tameside's collections will shift from December 25 to December 27. 

And if you're wondering about your Christmas tree, many councils are providing collection services through Just Helping or drop-off sites for recycling. Just remember to prep your tree properly by removing all decor first. So keep an eye on your local council’s website for specific dates and recycling tips to help keep our Manchester clean and green this festive season!
