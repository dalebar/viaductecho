A section of the M6 in Cheshire had to be closed after a van flipped over, trapping the driver and a dog inside. This happened close to junction 17 at Sandbach, just before 2pm on Monday, January 2026. Emergency services, including Cheshire Fire and Rescue, rushed to the scene where a fire engine and rapid response unit were deployed. Firefighters had to remove the windscreen to rescue the driver and the dog, who were then handed over to paramedics. The incident caused all four lanes to be shut, leading to significant delays.
