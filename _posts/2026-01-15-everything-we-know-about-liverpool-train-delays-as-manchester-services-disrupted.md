Train services to and from Liverpool Lime Street are facing major delays and cancellations due to a car crash into a bridge, causing disruptions since Thursday, January 15. Passengers can expect delays of up to 45 minutes and are advised to check their journeys before heading out. Affected routes include services to Manchester, London, Nottingham, and more. However, trains between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Airport and some other routes are running fine. Ticket restrictions have been lifted in the affected areas, allowing for more flexibility. Tickets are also valid on alternative services like Merseyrail and TransPennine Express without any extra charges. If trains are cancelled, passengers can use their tickets on other services within a two-hour window. Delayed passengers might be eligible for compensation—just hang on to your ticket and jot down your journey details. Normal restrictions will resume once the service is back on track.
