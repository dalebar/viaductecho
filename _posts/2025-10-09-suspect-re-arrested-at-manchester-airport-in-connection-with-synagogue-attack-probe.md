A suspect linked to the recent synagogue attack in north Manchester has been re-arrested at Manchester Airport. Jihad Al-Shamie, who launched a horrific attack on the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation during Yom Kippur on October 2, was shot dead by police. He allegedly pledged allegiance to ISIS during the incident. Following the attack, six others were detained, but many have been released without charge. The 30-year-old man re-arrested at the airport faces allegations of failing to disclose information under the Terrorism Act. Despite ongoing investigations by Counter Terrorism Policing North West, authorities believe there is currently no ongoing threat. Tragically, two victims were killed during the attack: Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53. For more updates, Manchester Evening News offers various platforms, including newsletters and WhatsApp groups, to keep locals informed about significant stories and developments.
