A bloke in Oldham, Charlie Cooper, was stunned when he spotted about ten peacocks in his neighbour's garden, climbing on cars and causing a right commotion. The 22-year-old travel vlogger filmed the scene and shared it on TikTok, where it went viral with over 17,000 likes. In his one-minute clip, Charlie even tried feeding one of the peacocks, which lunged for the crisp in his hand. Locals have nicknamed the area the 'peacock estate' due to these flamboyant birds wandering about, mainly because a neighbour tends to feed them. While some found the situation hilarious, sharing mixed reactions from thinking they’d move out to grumbling about dodging peacock droppings, others are debating whether the birds are pests or deserve protection. Quite the feathered affair!
