Plans for a new road in Royton, Oldham, are set to enhance safety for pedestrians and bus users, stemming from a recent public consultation. Starting in January 2026, the project will create a bus corridor along Rochdale Road with widened pavements, accessible bus stops, and improved lighting. While some locals are excited about the upgrades, many express concerns over potential traffic chaos during and after construction. Criticism includes worries about the removal of safety railings in the shopping precinct, which some residents believe are vital for safety based on past incidents. Yet, supporters highlight benefits for disabled users and a push for more active travel. Council members assure those concerned that essential railings will remain in key areas, and any disruptions will be managed carefully. The goal is to enhance accessibility and connectivity while addressing local feedback. The initiative is part of the larger Bee Network to improve transport across Greater Manchester, aiming to reduce congestion and better connect communities.
