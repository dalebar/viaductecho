A tragic incident in south Manchester led to the death of 16-year-old Alfie Moran, who was hit by a car while crossing Kingsway in Burnage. His mother described him as a “special boy with the biggest heart” and expressed her devastation over losing him. Following his passing, a fundraiser was launched to assist the family with funeral costs, quickly raising nearly £3,000. Alfie was remembered by his family and friends for his kindness and vibrant spirit, with heartfelt tributes pouring in. An investigation into the incident is ongoing, with an 18-year-old man previously arrested in connection with the case. Police are appealing for any witnesses or those with video footage to come forward.
