Tadi Alemeyeha, a 23-year-old man living in an asylum hotel in Didsbury, Manchester, faces accusations of sexual assault against a woman. His case was heard today at Manchester Crown Court. Though he was due for a plea and trial preparation hearing, Alemeyeha couldn't attend. He has previously pleaded not guilty to the charge at magistrates' court in August. The judge has adjourned the case until November for another pre-trial hearing, with a trial set for February. In the meantime, Alemeyeha remains in custody.
