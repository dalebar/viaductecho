Readers of the Manchester Evening News are voicing their frustration over the delays and soaring costs of the Manchester Town Hall refurbishment. Originally due to finish in spring 2024, it's now pushed back to spring 2027, with the total cost skyrocketing to £525 million—almost £200 million more than expected. Some, like Kianu, labelled it "an utter disgrace," comparing it to HS2 for its overspending, while Sue Haymes raised concerns over inconsistent explanations for the delays. Councillor criticisms included calling the situation "a disaster of project management," and Anthony 'Ted' Taylor questioned why there’s no penalty for the delays. Paul Candelent, the project director, noted that the contractor's setup means they don't bear the risk of delays unless negligence is involved. Commenters like Seymourtotti acknowledged the complexities of restoring such a historic building, suggesting the council's budgeting doesn't match the project's demands. Overall, there's a sense of disappointment with how this project is unfolding and a call for transparency towards taxpayers.
