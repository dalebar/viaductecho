A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman in her 30s was found dead at a house in Wythenshawe. Police received reports of a disturbance on Lulworth Gardens this morning, and despite CPR efforts, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. A blue forensics tent is now in place outside the terrace house. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officials reassure the public that they’re diligently investigating the incident and believe there’s no wider threat. Supt Gayle Brister stated that specialist officers are supporting the deceased’s family and emphasised the importance of community cooperation, inviting anyone with information to come forward. Witnesses can contact 101, quote log 516 of January 27, or reach out to Crimestoppers anonymously.
