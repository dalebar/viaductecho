Sir Howard Bernstein, Manchester's former council chief executive, is being honoured with a new road named after him, Sir Howard Bernstein Approach, in the First Street estate. He passed away in June 2024 at the age of 71, and is credited with driving Manchester's transformation, including bringing the Commonwealth Games to the city in 2002, regenerating Hulme, and redeveloping the city centre after the 1996 IRA bombing. The new street runs off Medlock Street and connects to James Grigor Square and Hulme Street. His wife, Lady Vanessa Bernstein, expressed how fitting it is to commemorate him in a city he loved and improved. Manchester City Council leader, Councillor Bev Craig, praised his lasting impact on modern local government. Developer Ask Real Estate highlighted that naming the street reflects Sir Howard's significant contributions to Manchester's evolution. The road joins other tributes in the area that celebrate figures who shaped the city, emphasizing Manchester's rich legacy and community spirit.
