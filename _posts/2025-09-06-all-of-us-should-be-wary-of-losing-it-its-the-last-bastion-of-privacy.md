A local chippy in Manchester serves up delicious haddock, but there's a growing concern about cashless payments. Many businesses are pushing for card payments to avoid processing fees, though some customers prefer cash. Steve Speakman, chair of the Manchester Civic Society, is campaigning to ensure that cash remains an option at major venues, like hospitals and galleries. His motivation stems from personal stories of people, including those with disabilities and the elderly, who struggle without cash. Despite some viewing him as outdated, Steve highlights the practical need for cash to prevent exclusion and maintain financial privacy. He’s had success in reinstating cash payments at various locations, sharing how staff often express relief at the return of cash for tips. Recent surveys show support for cash payments, with many fearing the vulnerabilities of a fully cashless society. As he continues to advocate for this cause, Steve’s efforts aim to safeguard cash access for everyone in Greater Manchester and beyond.
