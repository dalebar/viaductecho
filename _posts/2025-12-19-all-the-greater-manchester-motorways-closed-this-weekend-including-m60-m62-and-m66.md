Heads up, everyone! If you're planning to hit the shops or enjoy a night out the weekend before Christmas, be aware of some overnight motorway closures causing a bit of a hassle. From Friday, December 19 to Sunday, December 21, sections of the M60, M62, M66, and M67 will be closed for maintenance. The closures usually kick off around 9pm and should be lifted by 6am, so it’s a good idea to plan your route ahead of time to avoid any detours. Here’s a quick breakdown: M60 will see multiple closures, including from Junctions 6 to 9; M62 Westbound will close at Junction 18; and M67 has some entry and exit slip road closures. Drive safe and keep an eye out for those signs!
