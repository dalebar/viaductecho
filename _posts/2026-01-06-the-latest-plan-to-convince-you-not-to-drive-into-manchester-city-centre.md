Manchester council is planning to reduce car parking in the city centre as part of a new parking strategy aimed at creating a more walkable environment. The strategy includes consolidating parking spaces in hubs outside the inner ring road and encourages residents to use public transport instead of driving. Conor Chaplain, the transport lead, noted that as surface parking developments continue, the supply of parking in the city centre will gradually decline. There’s a push for more multi-storey car parks on the outskirts, like the recently opened Ancoats Mobility Hub, to better accommodate both visitors and residents. However, there are concerns about potential parking issues in nearby residential areas, with complaints from locals in Ancoats, Hulme, and Ardwick about commuters parking on their streets. The council is also considering improvements to controlled parking areas to address these problems. More details about the controlled parking zone and the overall strategy will be shared later this year for public feedback.
