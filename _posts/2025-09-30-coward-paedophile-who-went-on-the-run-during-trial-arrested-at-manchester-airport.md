Hassan Mahmood, a 24-year-old from Bury, was arrested at Manchester Airport after fleeing the country during his trial for serious child sex crimes. He was convicted on multiple charges, including engaging in sexual activities with a girl under 16, and was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison, all in his absence. Mahmood had absconded on the second day of the trial, reportedly heading to Pakistan. The court revealed he engaged in sexual communication and behaviour with the victim through Snapchat and FaceTime, despite knowing her age. Following his arrest, he sent the victim an abusive letter. Detective Constable Shaheen Saleh expressed relief that Mahmood is now facing justice, highlighting GMP's commitment to tackling child sexual offences.
