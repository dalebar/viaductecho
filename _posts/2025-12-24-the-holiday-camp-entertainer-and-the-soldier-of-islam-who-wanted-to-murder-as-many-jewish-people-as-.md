Two Islamic State fanatics plotted mass murder against Jewish people in Manchester, highlighting extreme hatred rooted in the Gaza conflict. Walid Saadaoui, a former holiday camp entertainer turned restaurant owner from Tunisia, and Amar Hussein, a self-identified ‘soldier of Allah’ from Iraq, represent contrasting lives. Saadaoui painted himself as a victim manipulated by a terror contact, Almasalahki, under threat; he claimed to dabble in magic instead of true Islam. Despite evidence, including Almasalahki's death, he maintained the narrative to the court. Hussein openly embraced terrorism, with his courtroom outbursts reflecting his unwavering commitment to jihad.

Saadaoui's brother, Bilel, was convicted of failing to inform authorities about the plot, showing sympathy towards ISIS views. He shared extremist materials and videos while dismissing them as harmless, claiming a mere interest in religion. Their trial exposed the complexities of radicalisation, with each seeking justification for their actions amidst a backdrop of fear, defiance, and manipulation, yet all aiming to carry out horrific acts in the name of a twisted ideology.
