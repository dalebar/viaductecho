Greater Manchester might see some snow next week, with flurries expected from early Tuesday morning, January 27. Temperatures are set to dip between 3°C and 4°C, prompting the chance of snowfall around 6am in areas like Wigan, Bolton, and Rochdale. Although snow is on the cards, no official weather warnings have been issued. As the day goes on, snow may turn into rain, especially in the western and central parts of the city. By 9am, northern parts, particularly Rochdale, are likely to have snow, but the flurries should clear as the day progresses. Moving into Wednesday, the forecast looks much drier with temperatures rising slightly to around 7°C and 8°C. Overall, the Met Office describes the weather as unsettled, especially on Tuesday with rain expected across the country due to a deep low-pressure system moving in. Keep an eye on the skies, folks!
