Victoria Smith from Heatons Cats is running a half marathon to raise funds for the charity, which has been facing challenges lately. She's already gathered over £800 for this important cause, as Heatons Cats relies on donations to provide care for cats that have had tough beginnings. The charity’s shop on Manchester Road, a primary source of income, is currently closed for refurbishments, leading to financial strain, particularly with unexpected medical costs for the animals. Despite having knee issues from a previous run, Victoria is committed to this challenge for a cause close to her heart. Every donation, big or small, will help ensure these cats get the love and care they deserve. You can support Victoria's fundraising efforts through her donation link.
