Victoria Smith, an employee at Heatons Cats, is fundraising for the charity, which has faced challenges recently due to a closed shop for refurbishments. She's running a half marathon to support the "small but mighty rescue and rehoming charity," and so far, has raised over £800. The funds will go towards covering essentials like food, medical care, and unexpected veterinary costs. Victoria is passionate about the cause and sees firsthand the dedication that goes into helping cats in need. Despite past knee issues with running, she’s determined to take on this challenge for the charity that means so much to her. Every donation, no matter how small, will make a difference for the cats. You can support her fundraising effort [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/halfmarathon-for-heatons-cats).
