At the Etihad Stadium, Manchester City fans paid heartfelt tributes to boxing legend Ricky Hatton, who passed away at 46. Before the Manchester derby, supporters applauded in his memory and unveiled a tribute banner featuring Hatton in City shorts, while the family watched emotionally. The display, organised by fan group 1894, included a silhouette on the big screens and a banner saying, "There's only one Ricky Hatton." His family was visibly moved, with his son Campbell in tears. They led the players onto the pitch, and flowers and a City scarf were laid on Ricky's seat. Blues manager Pep Guardiola greeted the family warmly upon arrival. Ricky's funeral is set for October 10 at Manchester Cathedral, with the public able to pay respects during the procession.
