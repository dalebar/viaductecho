Andy Burnham reassured Greater Manchester that “immediate danger has been averted” after a serious incident outside the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall. Armed police responded quickly following reports of a car driving at the public and a stabbing. The police confirmed an armed officer shot the male suspect at the scene. Four people sustained injuries from the incident, which is being investigated as a potential terror attack. 

Burnham noted that the situation is particularly alarming as it occurred on Yom Kippur, a significant day for the Jewish community. He emphasised the importance of community reassurance, especially for local Jewish residents who may be feeling anxious in light of recent events. The Community Security Trust is collaborating with the police and local community to address concerns after this "appalling attack."

Greater Manchester Police confirmed that the incident unfolded quickly, with emergency services on-site promptly, but cautioned the public to avoid the area as investigations continue.
