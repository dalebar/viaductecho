This Sunday in Stockport, expect a mix of early morning showers followed by partly cloudy skies. Morning temps kick off at about 9°C, peaking at a comfy 16°C later on, but with high humidity at 80%, it'll feel a bit muggy. With a 100% chance of rain early on, grab your umbrella before you head out. The rain should clear as the day goes on, making way for some nicer weather, though you should still watch out for wet roads during your morning commute. If you're hitting the roads or catching public transport, allow extra time for any delays. For the rest of the day, keep a light jacket handy and make sure to stay hydrated. The evening promises some lovely weather for dinner or a stroll outside. Enjoy!
