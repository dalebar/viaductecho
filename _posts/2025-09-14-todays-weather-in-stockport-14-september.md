Today's weather in Stockport is a bit of a mixed bag—partly cloudy with showers on the cards. Expect temps to hover between 9°C and 15°C, but with a high humidity of 86% and a solid 100% chance of rain, it’ll feel a touch heavier. Winds could gust up to 29 mph, making it feel chillier than it is. 

Morning starts off cool, warming slightly by the afternoon, but definitely grab a sturdy umbrella and waterproof gear if you’re heading out. Commuters might encounter slippery roads, so allow extra time and drive carefully. 

For outdoor plans, it’s best to aim for earlier in the afternoon when it’s warmest. Think about shifting any activities indoors if possible, and make sure to secure anything outside that the gusty winds might send flying. Stay safe and dry out there!
