Train passengers travelling on the west coast mainline out of Manchester are experiencing delays of up to two hours or cancellations due to an incident affecting the line to Stockport. Police were seen at Levenshulme station informing commuters that it was closed around 7pm. Delays of up to 120 minutes and many service cancellations are reported by Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, and East Midlands Railway. Avanti West Coast noted that emergency services are managing a situation which has led to blockages, causing some trains to be diverted and not stop at Stockport and Stoke-on-Trent. Theyâ€™ve arranged ticket acceptance with various rail companies for travel between Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly. British Transport Police has been approached for further information.
