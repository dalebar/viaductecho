Ashton’s historic town hall is set for a revitalising makeover after securing planning approval to restore its exterior, including the main steps and southern façade. This project is part of a £19.87m Government funding initiative aimed at regenerating the town centre by 2030. The plans will return the steps to their original 1840 design, enhancing safety and accessibility while aligning with ongoing improvements in Market Square for a lively civic space. Following its closure in 2015, the town hall fell into disrepair, but construction on the steps is slated for completion by Spring 2026. Future phases include creating community spaces, commercial venues like a wine bar and restaurant, and a revamped council chamber, with work expected to start in 2028. Every phase will adhere to strict heritage standards. Tameside council leader Eleanor Wills and Coun Stephen Homer expressed excitement about this transformative project, aiming to bring Ashton’s historic gem back to life while balancing its character and modern needs.
