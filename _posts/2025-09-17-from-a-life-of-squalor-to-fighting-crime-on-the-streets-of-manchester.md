Bruce, Pablo, Lola, and Nellie, four springer spaniels rescued from a squalid situation in Doncaster, are now joining Greater Manchester Police (GMP) as sniffer dogs. They were among 78 animals found in appalling conditions earlier this year, which a rescue boss described as one of the worst cases of cruelty. After rescue, the dogs showed potential, and four were selected to be trained for crime-fighting roles. The Tactical Dog Unit, now operating 24/7, is experiencing record levels of arrests thanks to its expansion. Between May and July 2025, the unit made 170 arrests linked to various local crimes, with significant increases in stop searches. One notable addition is Barney, GMPâ€™s first digital detection dog, trained to sniff out hidden electronic devices. His handler noted that Barney consistently finds items that officers might overlook, playing a crucial role in serious investigations. Chief Inspector Chris Clarke highlighted the vital contributions of these dogs, emphasising their importance in maintaining safety across Greater Manchester.
