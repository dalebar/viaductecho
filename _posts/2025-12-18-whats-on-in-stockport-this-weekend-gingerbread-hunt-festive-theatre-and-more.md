Stockport's got a lively weekend ahead with plenty of events! Thanks to sponsors like EatGoodWest UK and Worker Bee Markets, there's a mix of fun activities to check out. Highlights include the popular panto "Aladdin" at Stockport Plaza, featuring Brian Capron as Abanazar and Karim Zeroual as Aladdin, running from 5 December 2025 to 4 January 2026. 

Over at Bramall Hall, you can join the Elf Trail until 21 December, where kids can hunt for cheeky elves and earn a treat for just £3. Meanwhile, Merseyway shopping centre is hosting a free Gingerbread Hunt from 20-21 December, where families can help Mrs Claus find missing gingerbread men, culminating in a visit to Father Christmas and some sweet goodies.
