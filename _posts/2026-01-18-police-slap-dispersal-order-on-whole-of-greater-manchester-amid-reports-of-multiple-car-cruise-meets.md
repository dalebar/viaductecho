Police have issued a dispersal order across Greater Manchester due to concerns over organised car meetings, particularly after a tragic crash in Bolton that resulted in four fatalities. The order, effective from 3.30pm today until 5am Monday, empowers officers to remove anyone suspected of anti-social behaviour. Chief Insp John Haywood stressed the need for safety, citing past incidents where such gatherings led to risks for attendees. He urged anyone planning to attend these events to think about their potential impact and to follow police instructions to ensure public safety and order.
