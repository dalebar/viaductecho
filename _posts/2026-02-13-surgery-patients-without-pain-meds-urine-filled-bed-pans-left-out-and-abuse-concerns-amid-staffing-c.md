Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester is facing serious concerns after a recent inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) revealed staffing shortages and a lack of proper care, resulting in patients experiencing pain and delays in receiving help. The surgical services have been rated as 'requires improvement', with inspectors issuing a warning due to risks of abuse and problems with hygiene, such as uncollected bottles and bedpans. Patients reported feeling unsafe and uncomfortable asking for help, particularly during night shifts. 

Inspectors noted multiple regulatory breaches, including inadequate staff training and poor management of risks, which have persisted since earlier inspections. Although improvements are reportedly underway, including hiring additional nursing staff, the environment remains aged and worn, raising further concerns about patient safety. The hospital is under pressure to make "rapid and significant improvements," with the CQC warning that more drastic actions could be taken if standards don't rise. Overall, the hospital's rating remains 'requires improvement', highlighting ongoing challenges in delivering safe and effective care.
