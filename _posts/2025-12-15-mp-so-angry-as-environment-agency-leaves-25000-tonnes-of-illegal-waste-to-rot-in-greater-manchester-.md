Wigan MP Josh Simons has strongly criticised the Environment Agency for not addressing a toxic waste dump in Bickershaw while spending millions to clear a similar site in Kidlington, Oxfordshire. Simons emphasised the dangers the Bickershaw dump poses to local residents and especially children at a nearby school, noting it's already caught fire twice. He feels the EA's inaction reflects a bias against working-class communities, stating, “What’s not ‘exceptional’ about a toxic waste dump on fire next to a primary school?” Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham also requested clarity on how the waste allowed to pile up. The EA, however, defended its decision, citing newly discovered risks at the Kidlington site and stressing that they aim to hold the polluters accountable rather than taxpayers. Simons vows to continue fighting for fair treatment for his constituents, highlighting a stark divide in how environmental issues are managed in affluent versus working-class areas.
