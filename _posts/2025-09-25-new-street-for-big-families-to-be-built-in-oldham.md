Oldham is set to get 14 new family homes thanks to Hafiz Construction & Management's planning permission. The development will feature four, five, and six-bed houses arranged around a cul-de-sac off Cambridge Street, complete with gardens and private parking. Although these homes will be bigger than nearby ones, they aim to create a distinct identity in the area. The site, once a community green space owned by the council, is now mainly scrubland with no significant vegetation. Town planner Dave Richards highlighted its readiness for redevelopment, and while the council considered a financial contribution for local open spaces, they deemed it would make the project unviable. This new build could really help tackle Oldham's overcrowding issue, with around 7.5% of homes classified as overcrowded, notably higher than the national average.
