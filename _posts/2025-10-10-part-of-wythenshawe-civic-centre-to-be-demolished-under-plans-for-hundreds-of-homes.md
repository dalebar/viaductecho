Wythenshawe’s Civic Centre is set for a massive revamp, with part of it being demolished for new homes as part of a £500 million investment. The project aims to create a vibrant town centre featuring a culture hub, greenery, and a food hall, alongside 2,000 new homes. Developers have shared plans for the first 400 homes, which include residential units in Brotherton House (which will be converted) and the demolition of Alpha House and The Birtles shopping arcade. Alpha House will yield 125 new apartments, while The Birtles will feature 80 flats and commercial space. These homes will focus on affordability, with most capped at social rent, ensuring they're accessible for locals. Council leader Bev Craig emphasised the importance of quality housing for health and well-being, and WHCG’s Andrea Lowman highlighted the project’s community-driven approach. Residents can provide feedback on the plans online until October 26, or in person at Open Space on October 16.
