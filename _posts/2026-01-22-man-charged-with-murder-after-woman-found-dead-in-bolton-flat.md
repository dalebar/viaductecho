A 33-year-old man, James Morton, has been charged with murder after a 45-year-old woman was found dead in a flat in Bolton. Emergency services responded to a welfare concern on January 19 but unfortunately, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Forensic teams conducted investigations at Kempton Gardens, and police cordoned off the area. Morton, who was arrested at the scene, is now remanded in custody and set to appear in Wigan and Leigh Magistrates Court on January 22. Greater Manchester Police are appealing for anyone with information to get in touch, whether through 101, the Live Chat, or Crimestoppers for anonymous tips. They're particularly interested in any relevant images or footage related to the incident.
