Three men have been charged following a pitch invasion aimed at Gary Neville during Salford City FC's match against Oldham Athletic on October 18. The match was interrupted when several men, wearing hoodies stating "Gary Neville is a traitor," stormed the pitch. Britain First, a far-right group, claimed responsibility, alleging they collaborated with local Salford supporters. This protest comes after Neville removed a British flag from one of his properties, citing its negative connotations, leading to public backlash. The men waved England flags while one attempted to plant a flagpole in the centre circle. They were quickly removed by stewards, and the match resumed. Charged under the Football Offences Act 1991 are Dominic Campbell, 33, and Tyler Brown, 20, both charged with pitch encroachment and throwing a missile. Christopher Walsh, 43, is charged with pitch encroachment. All three have been bailed and will appear in court in February 2026.
