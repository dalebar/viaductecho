The Jewish community in Manchester is deeply affected by a horrific terror attack during a Hanukkah celebration in Sydney, where 16 people were killed, including British rabbi Eli Schlanger, with ties to the local community. The incident comes shortly after a similar attack in Manchester. Community leaders expressed a mix of fear and resilience, with many feeling the threat is real even across the globe. GMP is boosting security in local Jewish areas, which has been met with some reassurance, though critics point out that safety measures treat symptoms rather than the root causes of hatred. Community representatives spoke about the emotional toll of recent events, with concerns about safety remaining high. Despite these ongoing fears, there's a strong spirit within the Manchester Jewish community to continue celebrating their heritage and living proudly as Mancunian Jews.
