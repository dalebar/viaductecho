Trafford Council's gearing up for a tough financial year, planning to borrow over £12 million while implementing one of the highest council tax hikes in the UK, at 7.5%. They face a projected £34 million budget shortfall, largely due to government funding cuts of £24 million over three years, while neighbouring Manchester gets a cash boost instead. The budget gap for the upcoming year is around £19 million, driven by soaring costs in adult social care, children’s services, and temporary housing. To tackle this, the council is exploring various cost-saving measures and is working to find an additional £27 million by 2028/9 to balance the books. Labour leader Tom Ross acknowledges the challenges but insists on the necessity of tough decisions to ensure the borough’s financial health while continuing to provide essential services for vulnerable residents. The draft budget will be discussed at the upcoming full council meeting.
