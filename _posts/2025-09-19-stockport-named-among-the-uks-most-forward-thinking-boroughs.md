Stockport has been hailed by PwC as one of the UK’s most investable and forward-thinking boroughs. Their report highlights the town's new housing projects, vibrant events scene, and a plethora of leisure options, noting that Stockport is establishing its own identity apart from Manchester. PwC emphasised how its mix of city proximity, unique character, and affordability enables Stockport to stand on its own. They specifically praised the Mayoral Development Corporation’s efforts in regenerating the town centre, especially the ambitious Town Centre West project, which aims to create 4,000 new homes on 130 acres of Brownfield land. A spokesperson from Stockport Council expressed pride in this recognition, pointing to developments like new homes, a rooftop park, and modern workspaces as part of building a lively community for residents and visitors alike.
