Pizza Hut is shutting down 79 restaurants across the UK, but the Stockport branch will remain open. On 20 October, the chain entered administration, leading to the closure of 68 restaurants and 11 delivery sites. Nearby locations in Ashton, Oldham, Manchester Fort, Bolton, and Rochdale will be affected. The closures result from tough trading conditions and rising costs, risking around 1,200 jobs. However, thanks to a deal with Yum! Brands, 1,277 jobs at 64 other locations have been saved. Stockport's Pizza Hut at 103a Wellington Road South will keep serving customers alongside its usual pizza and dessert offerings.
