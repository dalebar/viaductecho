Life Leisure is rallying behind the Let's Lift the Curfew campaign, led by This Girl Can, aimed at addressing the curfew many women feel during the darker months due to safety fears. From November to March, they'll host 5k run clubs across Stockport to promote solidarity and raise awareness of barriers women face exercising outdoors after dark. Now in its third year, the campaign calls for better safety measures and allyship as it highlights the societal issues that limit women’s freedom. Participants can join runs each month at various locations and are encouraged to share their experiences on social media with the hashtag #LetsLiftTheCurfew. The initiative is open to those aged 16 and up, including men supporting the cause. Life Leisure aims to foster safer, more supportive spaces, encouraging conversations and real change in the community. For more info, check their website.
