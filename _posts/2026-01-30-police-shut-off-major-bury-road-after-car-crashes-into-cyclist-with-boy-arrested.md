A road in Bury was taped off after a collision between a car and a cyclist on January 29. Witnesses reported a significant police and ambulance presence, including an air ambulance landing nearby. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed that the cyclist was taken to hospital with injuries that aren’t life-threatening. A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop following the incident and is currently in custody. Photos show damage to a white vehicle at the scene. The road has since reopened, but congestion remains in the area. Police are still present as they continue their investigations.
