Stockport's weather this week is shaping up to be quite the mix! Starting off on Monday, you'll enjoy clear skies, but things swiftly change with rain and snow expected from Tuesday onward. Temperatures will hover between -7°C and around 10°C by Sunday, so it's a bit of a rollercoaster.

Monday kicks off with a chilly -1°C, no rain in sight, but from Tuesday, you're looking at a complete shift with a 100% chance of precipitation. Expect wet and snowy conditions midweek, particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday continues this trend, and Friday brings more of the same, though Saturday might get a break, with just a 52% chance of rain or snow.

For your weekend plans, keep an eye out for Saturday’s possible rain or snow, while Sunday warms up a bit but might be windy. Commuters should stay alert for delays and slippery roads due to the weather changes. Best to prepare for anything, like bringing your umbrella and maybe opting for indoor fun!
