Dozens of flood alerts are out across England, including two in Greater Manchester, thanks to Storm Bram’s heavy overnight rain. The Met Office predicts continued rain in the region until around 11am, easing to showers by 1pm. The Environment Agency has issued 32 red flood warnings, signalling that flooding is likely, while another 172 amber alerts indicate possible flooding. This includes the Lower River Irwell catchment in Greater Manchester, affecting areas like central Manchester and Salford Quays. Residents have been advised to stay clear of low-lying paths and bridges near watercourses and to avoid driving through floodwater. A second amber alert covers the Upper River Irwell catchment, impacting parts of Oldham, Bolton, and Rochdale. River levels are expected to remain high until 3pm today. Across the UK, there are additional weather warnings in place for rain and strong winds, particularly in the South West and North Wales. It's best to stay safe and keep an eye on the situation!
