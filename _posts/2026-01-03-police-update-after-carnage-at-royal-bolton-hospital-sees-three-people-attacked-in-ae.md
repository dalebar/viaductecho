Police have updated the public after three individuals were attacked at Royal Bolton Hospital on January 3. Witnesses described chaos in the A&E waiting room when a man launched unprovoked attacks. Michael Anderson, who helped restrain the attacker, recounted how an elderly man was punched, and another bystander had a part of their ear bitten off when they tried to intervene. The attacker, a 22-year-old British male, was arrested on suspicion of assault and racial public order offences, and he is now detained under the Mental Health Act. The incident left one man in his 30s with serious ear injuries and two others with minor injuries. Det Chief Insp Mike Sharples acknowledged the public's concern and assured that a thorough investigation is underway. This incident followed another attack in Newton-le-Willows just days prior, where six people were hurt with a crowbar. The suspect in that case is also detained under the Mental Health Act. Anyone with information about either incident is encouraged to contact the police.
