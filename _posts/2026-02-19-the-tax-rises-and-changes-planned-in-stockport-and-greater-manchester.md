Councils across Greater Manchester are finalising their budgets, affecting council tax rates for residents. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), led by Mayor Andy Burnham, recently approved a 20% tax increase, raising costs for a typical band D home from £128.95 to £153.95 annually. While some opposition councillors criticise these rises, Burnham argues the budget will improve residents' lives through various measures, like removing the 9:30am limit on bus passes for the elderly and disabled, and extending the £2 bus fare cap until 2026. 

Stockport council is also planning a 4.99% tax hike, amidst £20m in savings and possible job cuts, with council leader Mark Roberts blaming funding gaps on inadequate support from the government. He emphasises that Stockport's challenges stem from prioritising London and the south, leaving them in a tough spot for the future.
