A mum-of-three, Mandy Hendry, was caught at Manchester Airport bringing over 20kg of cannabis from Thailand after being promised a free holiday and £8,000. She initially claimed there were cigarettes in her suitcase but later admitted to having cannabis. After pleading guilty, the court learned she had recently left an abusive relationship, which had affected her mental health. The prosecution highlighted a significant rise in drug smuggling cases, with Hendry's case being among many similar offences across the UK. Judge Tom Gilbart acknowledged her naivety and low risk of reoffending, opting for a suspended sentence of 14 months instead of prison time. She’ll also have to complete 25 days of rehabilitation and 250 hours of unpaid work.
