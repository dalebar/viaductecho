Just a week left until the Gorton and Denton by-election on February 26, with 11 candidates vying to replace Andrew Gwynne, who stepped down for health reasons. The campaign's been pretty wild, featuring drama, apologies, and even police probes. Labour's Angeliki Stogia is facing pressure from her party’s recent controversies, while the Reform UK's Matt Goodwin and the Green Party's Hannah Spencer are seen as strong challengers. 

The atmosphere is tense, with Labour and the Greens battling over who’s best positioned to beat Reform, resulting in some public squabbles, including a back-and-forth over campaign banners. Farage's Reform UK also stirred controversy when their candidate suggested taxing non-parents, which Farage has since tried to distance himself from. 

With previous weeks marked by heated debates and troubling incidents like an effigy found outside a school, it’s shaping up to be a contentious race. So, it's all eyes on Gorton and Denton as candidates gear up for the final push before voting day!
