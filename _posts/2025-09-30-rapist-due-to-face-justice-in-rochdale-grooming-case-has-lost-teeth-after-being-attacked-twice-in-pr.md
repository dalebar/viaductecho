Mushtaq Ahmed, 66, is facing sentencing for his involvement in the grooming and historic sexual abuse of two vulnerable girls in Rochdale. Since being remanded in prison, he's been attacked twice and lost his front teeth, leaving him fearful of his future behind bars. Ahmed is one of seven men scheduled for sentencing related to the abuse from the mid-2000s, where the girls were treated as "sex slaves" and forced into degrading situations by their abusers, many of whom were local taxi drivers or market traders.

During the hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court, defence barristers described the personal circumstances of the defendants, highlighting their backgrounds and the impact of their crimes. For example, one defendant's barrister claimed he was easily influenced by peers, while another's background and character were depicted in a more sympathetic light despite his conviction. The sentencing is expected to conclude soon, with the judge considering the complexities of each defendant's situation.
