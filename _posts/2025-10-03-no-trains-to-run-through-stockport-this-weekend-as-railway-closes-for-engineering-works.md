The railway in Stockport will be closed from 4th to 5th October to facilitate engineering work on the Greek Street bridge and roundabout. Engineers will dismantle a redundant wall in the tracks and begin reinstating the road and walls on the roundabout above. Passengers travelling from Piccadilly to Macclesfield, Stoke, and beyond should check travel plans using the National Rail journey planner. Project manager William Brandon acknowledged the public's patience, noting this closure is crucial for safely installing components of the new roundabout. The bridge replacement, which is about halfway complete, is expected to last for 120 years. After these closures, more work will be needed over Christmas, and Greek Street will remain closed to vehicles until Spring 2026, though pedestrians can still access it.
