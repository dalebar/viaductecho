Next month, Manchester will host a horse-drawn procession for local legend Jimmy "The Weed" Donnelly’s funeral. Hundreds are expected to pay their respects to Jimmy, who passed away peacefully at 84 after battling cancer, just weeks after his brother Arthur's death. Celebrated for his colourful history as a member of the notorious Quality Street Gang, he also made his mark as a successful businessman and boxing promoter. 

Jimmy's funeral will take place on Friday, October 3, starting from his home in Victoria Square, Ancoats. Mourners can join the procession to St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Collyhurst for a requiem mass at 11.30 am, followed by interment at St Joseph’s cemetery. The family invites everyone to celebrate Jimmy’s life at a reception at The World Heritage Irish Centre after the ceremony. A true character with a legacy, Jimmy is remembered fondly by many in the city.
