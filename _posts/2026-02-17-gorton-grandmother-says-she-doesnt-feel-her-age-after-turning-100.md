Margaret Shaw, a lively grandmother from Gorton, has just turned 100 and doesn’t quite feel her age. Celebrated with loved ones at Gorton Parks Home, she humorously responds to the secret of her longevity, saying, “I don’t think I’m 100—someone must have got that wrong!” The dedicated team at Advinia Healthcare organised a party for her, featuring a performance by singer Craig. Family has always been central to Margaret’s life, having been married to her husband Maurise and naming their son after him. Home Manager Barbara Cameron praised Margaret, saying she's a joy to care for, highlighting the uniqueness of reaching such an impressive milestone. The party was a heartwarming occasion, reflecting Margaret's warm spirit and the affection she’s garnered from both family and the care team.
