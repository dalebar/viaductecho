Greater Manchester is considering introducing self-driving vehicles, backed by Andy Burnham's office, with a trial planned in Bolton as part of Transport for Greater Manchester’s strategy through to 2050. The proposal involves a 24/7 autonomous vehicle service along a decommissioned railway between Royal Bolton Hospital and the town's interchange, with potential expansion to Logistics North. The project is still in the early stages with no set timetable. A council spokesperson highlighted that the system would utilise small electric vehicles and operate more affordably and with less environmental impact than traditional rail services. Additionally, TfGM is exploring AI for traffic management and the use of drones to address congestion. The overall goal is to reduce car journeys from 60% to 50%, and the draft strategy is open for public feedback.
