A fifth man has been released on bail following his arrest connected to a shooting in Urmston, Trafford, which left a 21-year-old man in a critical but stable condition. The incident occurred on January 16, after emergency services were alerted around 8.40pm. The 38-year-old suspect was held on suspicion of attempted murder and conspiracy, joining four others aged 18, 21, 25, and 28, who were also arrested on similar charges. All five have since been released on bail as Greater Manchester Police continue their investigation. Detective Chief Inspector Justin Bryant reassured the public that such violence won't be tolerated while urging anyone with information or footage to come forward. They can reach GMP via 101 or through LiveChat, and there's also an option to report anonymously to Crimestoppers.
