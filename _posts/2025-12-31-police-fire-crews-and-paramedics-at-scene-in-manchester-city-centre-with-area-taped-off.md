On Tuesday evening, December 30, emergency services in Manchester responded to a welfare concern involving a man on the top floor of an NCP car park near Bloom Street and Chorlton Street. The area was cordoned off for about 40 minutes while police, fire crews, and paramedics dealt with the situation. Photos showed a significant presence of vehicles from various emergency services, including Enhanced Rescue Units. Thankfully, the incident was resolved safely, leading to the lifting of the cordon. The fire service and North West Ambulance Service provided assistance but remained on site for only about half an hour. No further details have been shared.
