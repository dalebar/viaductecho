A 14-year-old boy is set to face court for his role in the tragic e-scooter accident that led to the death of Jacob Calland, also 14, in Wythenshawe. Jacob tragically passed away eight days after the crash with a car on Timpson Road last March. His mother, Carly, started a campaign called Jacob's Journey to raise awareness about e-scooter safety and push for regulatory changes. She shared a poignant final photo of herself and Jacob together in hospital. Jacob was remembered as a bright and loving boy whose life was cut short. The accused, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving, as well as driving unlicensed and uninsured. He’s been released on bail and is due to appear at Manchester youth court on February 24.
