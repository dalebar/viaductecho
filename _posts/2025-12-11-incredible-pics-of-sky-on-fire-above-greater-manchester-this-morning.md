This morning in Greater Manchester, locals have been treated to a stunning fiery dawn sky, with vibrant reds and oranges lighting up the horizon. Photos are pouring in from all over the region, showcasing the beautiful silhouettes of homes and trees against this dramatic backdrop. Such skies often spark thoughts of the old sailor's rhyme about predicting weather changes, and there's some truth to it. The fiery look is created by sunlight scattering through dust and moisture in the atmosphere, especially when a high-pressure system moves eastwards. This implies there could be some rough weather ahead, as the saying rings truer in mid-latitude areas. There’s a lovely collection of photos shared by readers, capturing the breathtaking views from various spots like Middleton, Bolton, Oldham, and beyond. Quite the sight for a brisk Manchester morning!
