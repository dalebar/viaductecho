Three members of a gang involved in a massive fraud operation at a now-closed Manchester food business were sentenced at Bolton Crown Court for handling over £500,000 of stolen goods. The investigation, launched by Greater Manchester Police in 2017, uncovered that the gang illegally acquired frozen chicken and other products using cloned company details, defrauding 13 firms across Europe. Key players included ringleader Devinder Singh, who received six years and six months, and Zakaria Dean, sentenced to two years and nine months. Mohammad Farid got a two-year suspended sentence. Both Singhs were previously disqualified from company directorships but continued their operations, breaching court orders. Paul Barrett, connected to the haulage yard, received a suspended sentence as well. The Detective Constable highlighted that, despite their claims of innocence, evidence showed they knowingly advertised stolen goods at lower prices.
