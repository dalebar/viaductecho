A recent poll indicates that Andy Burnham would secure more votes than Keir Starmer in a Labour leadership contest, with 62% of Labour members supporting Burnham compared to 29% for Starmer. It’s a tough time for Starmer, as a third of members believe he’s not doing well, and 37% think he shouldn't lead Labour into the next election. Burnham is seen as the frontrunner, with 54% backing him as the preferred successor. 

In the deputy leadership race, Lucy Powell has a slight edge over Bridget Phillipson, with 35% saying they’d support Powell. Angela Rayner's recent resignation was viewed unfavourably by 60% of respondents. Burnham's approval ratings have dipped somewhat, despite overall high support, particularly in South West England. Though he hints at a potential leadership bid, he maintains commitment to his role as Greater Manchester mayor and won't start a campaign without being in Parliament. He’s all about staying local for now!
