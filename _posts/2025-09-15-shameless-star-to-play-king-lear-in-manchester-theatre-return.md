David Threlfall, famed for his role as Frank Gallagher in Shameless, is set to take on King Lear at Manchester's Royal Exchange next year. This will mark his return to the stage at the venue after a long hiatus since 1999. Sir Tom Courtenay, a familiar face at the Royal Exchange, will also make an appearance in a pre-recorded segment. The theatreâ€™s anniversary season promises more excitement, featuring the premiere of Rory Mullarkey's Even These Things, which explores key moments in Manchester's history, including the dramatic impact of the 1996 IRA bombing on the city and theatre.
