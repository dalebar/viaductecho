Martha Machiek lives with her four kids in a cramped three-bedroom flat on Lancashire Hill, one of the poorest areas in Greater Manchester, after fleeing war in South Sudan. The family faces serious challenges, including a lack of hot water and a single toilet for nine people, leading to stress and conflict among the children. They've reported issues like mould and persistent maintenance problems to Stockport Homes, the social housing provider, but feel their concerns are not being adequately addressed. Alongside Martha, other residents express frustration over broken lifts and general neglect in the community. While some find positives in their close-knit environment, many feel overlooked amidst local investment elsewhere. Community leaders, like Green Party Councillor James Frizzell, are advocating for better support and improvements in living conditions, emphasising the need for urgent attention to these ongoing issues to avoid a deepening social crisis. Stockport Homes acknowledges the challenges and claims to provide support, but residents remain sceptical about the changes and improvements promised.
