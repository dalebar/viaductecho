Over 50 roads in Manchester are getting a facelift ahead of autumn and winter, with Â£1.93m allocated for preventive maintenance. The work, scheduled from September 16 to September 27, involves a two-stage process using bitumen and stone chips, potentially extending road life by up to a decade. Expect lower speed limits and closures during the work, with the aim to improve safety and efficiency for drivers. Councillor Tracey Rawlins emphasises the importance of acting now to protect roads from winter stresses, thanking residents for their patience. Specific roads across areas like Cheetham Hill, Longsight, and the city centre will be upgraded, ensuring a smoother ride for everyone in the coming years.
