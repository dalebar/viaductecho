Ricky Hatton, the beloved boxer from Stockport, sadly passed away at his home in Hyde on 14 September. His family described him as more than just a world champion, emphasising his role as a loving son, father, grandfather, and friend. They remembered Richard for his big heart, kindness, and the way he inspired generations with his fighting spirit and humility. Despite his immense success in boxing, he remained very much the down-to-earth lad from Stockport. The family expressed overwhelming grief but found solace in the support and love from the community, highlighting the impact Richard had on so many lives. They asked for privacy as they navigate this loss, but take comfort knowing his legacy, both in the sport and as a person, will endure. No suspicious circumstances were reported surrounding his death. After retiring, Hatton actively campaigned for mental health awareness, even opening a new mental health wing at Crumpsall Hospital earlier this year.
