Aer Lingus passengers are feeling stressed and frustrated after multiple flights from Manchester to New York JFK were cancelled this week, with issues attributed to ‘aircraft technical problems’. Flights EI 45 on December 2 and 4 were among those cancelled, with more cancellations expected from December 3-7. Aer Lingus has apologised and is trying to rebook affected passengers, primarily onto indirect flights via Dublin or alternative carriers. Many passengers reported only getting last-minute notifications about their cancellations, leaving them anxious about onward travel plans. Experiences shared on social media reflect their dissatisfaction, including last-minute changes and poor communication from the airline. Some travellers have found themselves unexpectedly switched to indirect flights despite paying for direct routes. Adding to the turmoil, Aer Lingus may be closing its Manchester operating base, putting over 200 staff jobs at risk, following recent strike actions related to pay discrepancies. Overall, passengers are unhappy and concerned about their disrupted travel plans and the airline’s handling of the situation.
