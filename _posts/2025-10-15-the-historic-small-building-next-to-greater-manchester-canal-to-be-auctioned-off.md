The Transhipment Warehouse in Dobcross, a century-old gem by the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, is heading to auction with a guide price of £37,500. Once a loading shed for Stonebottom Mill, it’s been rejuvenated as an office for the Huddersfield Canal Society since 2009. Now, it’s ready for a new purpose, whether as a unique office space or potential holiday let with stunning waterside views. The property includes an entrance hall, meeting room, office, kitchen, and W.C. While it currently lacks mooring rights, the seller suggests the Canal and River Trust might grant them with the right approach. Auctioneer James Pank highlights the building's historic significance and appealing scenery, making it a great opportunity for either a business or a boating enthusiast. The auction takes place online on October 21 at 12pm.
