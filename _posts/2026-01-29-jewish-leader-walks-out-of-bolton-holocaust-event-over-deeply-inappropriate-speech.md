Marc Levy, head of the Jewish Representative Council for Greater Manchester, walked out of Bolton's Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations, claiming a speech by deputy council leader Akhtar Zaman "politicised" the occasion. Levy found it inappropriate for Zaman to reference Gaza and other current conflicts during a day dedicated to remembering the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis. While reflecting on various humanitarian crises, Zaman's remarks sparked controversy, prompting Levy to leave before his own scheduled reading. He expressed that such politicisation detracted from the focus of the day, which was meant to honour those affected by genocide. Bolton Council, hosting the event, stated they regretted Levy’s early departure and emphasised that the event aims to connect historical lessons with contemporary issues. They reiterated the importance of remembering the Holocaust while also recognising ongoing global conflicts, stating their commitment to dialogue with Levy about his concerns.
