Bury's upcoming food market will be called Casewells, named after the town’s first black pudding shop, established in 1810. Though it was demolished in 1968, locals chose to revive the name through a public vote for the new 'flexi-hall' being built at Bury Market. Midlands Events Bury Ltd (MEB) is set to potentially operate the venue, which will feature 12 food and retail units, a central bar, and a performance stage. The firm, known for running Queens Market in Rhyl, aims to manage Casewells with a long-term lease starting once the hall opens in Autumn 2026. Councillor Eamonn O'Brien sees this as a pivotal step for Bury’s town centre, enhancing the night-time economy and complementing the well-loved market. MEB's director, Jordan Burnett, expressed excitement about the hall's potential to blend food, culture, and community vibes. A council meeting is set for February 11 to discuss the plan further.
