Greater Manchester's been given a heads-up about delayed travel due to snow and ice on Monday, January 5. Yellow weather warnings, in effect from Sunday at 10am until midday Monday, foretell possible disruptions and slippery surfaces across the region. The Met Office expects snow showers to move inland, with 1-3cm accumulating in many places, and potentially 5-8cm in some areas by Monday morning. Travelers are advised to be cautious on untreated roads, pavements, and cycle paths, as icy patches are likely. National Rail recommends checking before you head out, noting they'll do their utmost to keep services running safely despite the cold weather. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Matthew Lehnert warns of winter weather hazards but notes that milder conditions may arrive midweek, bringing possible rain and more organised snow as temperatures fluctuate. Best to wrap up warm if you’re heading out!
