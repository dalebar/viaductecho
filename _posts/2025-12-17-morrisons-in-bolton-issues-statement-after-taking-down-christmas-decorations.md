A Morrisons in Bolton faced backlash after removing its Christmas decorations at the Atlas Mills store, sparking complaints that they were 'offensive'. While the store hasn’t confirmed this reason, locals reacted strongly on social media, with some threatening to boycott. In response, Morrisons reinstated the decorations, citing a 'miscommunication' for their removal. Despite this, some critics remained upset, arguing that Christmas decorations shouldn't offend anyone and should be celebrated as part of a multi-faith community like Bolton. Local Councillor Susan Priest echoed these sentiments, emphasising the importance of celebrating all religions and seasonal festivities throughout the year. Morrisons stated that the decorations are meant to create a festive atmosphere for customers and colleagues and are currently investigating the mix-up, though they won't comment further for now.
