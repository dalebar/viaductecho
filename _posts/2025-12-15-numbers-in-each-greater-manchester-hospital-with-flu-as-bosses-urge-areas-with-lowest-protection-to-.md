Greater Manchester is currently experiencing a significant rise in flu cases, with an average of 164 patients admitted to hospitals daily. This figure has jumped 48% in just a week and is the second highest in England, behind Birmingham. Health officials warn that admissions are increasing even more rapidly, with A&Es facing double their usual numbers. The flu outbreak is attributed to a newly dominant strain known as A(H3N2), or 'super flu,' creating intense pressure on the NHS, comparable to the challenges faced during Covid. NHS Greater Manchester encourages eligible families to utilise extra flu vaccination clinics running from December 12 to 30, particularly in areas with low vaccination uptake. Dr Helen Wall reminds everyone to take precautions, such as washing hands and staying home when sick, to help manage the strain on health services.
