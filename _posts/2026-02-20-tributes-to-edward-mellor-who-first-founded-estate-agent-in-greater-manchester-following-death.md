Edward Mellor, a well-respected estate agent and lifelong Manchester City fan, sadly passed away on February 15. He launched his estate agency in Gorton back in 1983, growing it into a 13-branch network spanning Manchester and beyond, alongside a national online auction house. Edward's passion for integrity and professionalism helped shape a family legacy that now thrives under his son, Colin Mellor. Colin shared a heartfelt tribute, highlighting his father's belief in placing trust and relationships at the core of estate agency. Though Edward stepped back from daily operations in the mid-90s, he remained deeply involved with the business he loved. His values and standards continue to guide the agency today, ensuring that his legacy lives on through his family and the team. Edward Mellor will always be remembered not just as an estate agent, but as a legend who built a reputation and culture that endures.
