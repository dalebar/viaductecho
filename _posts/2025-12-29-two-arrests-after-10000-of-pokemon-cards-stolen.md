Two men, aged 24 and 26 from Leeds, were nabbed in Manchester after stealing over £10,000 worth of collectible Pokémon cards. They allegedly broke into a warehouse in Nottinghamshire on December 27, cutting through fences and removing bricks to get to the goods. After loading the cards into a cloned plate van, the duo headed to South Yorkshire and then Manchester. Police tracked the van and caught them in a storage yard while they were unloading the stolen loot. Detective Sergeant Andrea Brown praised the swift collaboration between Nottinghamshire and Greater Manchester Police, highlighting the importance of tackling burglary due to its impact on businesses and residents. The police also discovered burglary tools in the van, and the investigation is ongoing to find any additional suspects.
