Three people, including a man from Bolton, are in court over charges related to supporting and financing the terrorist group Hamas. Bisharet Ali, 61, and Mohmed Patel, 50, are accused of promoting support for Hamas and acquiring funds for terrorist purposes between October 2023 and January 2024. Ayesha Ali, 33, faces similar charges but is said to have only had "reasonable cause" to suspect the funds would be used for terrorism. All three defendants, who are British nationals, confirmed their identities during a brief hearing at the Old Bailey. Prosecutors summarised the charges as funding and supporting Hamas, with a trial set for November 9, 2026, at Nottingham Crown Court. Bisharet Ali and Patel received conditional bail, while Ayesha Ali was granted unconditional bail, leading up to a plea and trial preparation hearing on March 6 next year.
