In September 2024, a freight train derailed in Audenshaw, Greater Manchester, due to undetected failed screws on the track. Nine out of 24 wagons derailed, causing significant damage and an eight-week railway closure, but thankfully, no one was injured. Residents felt their houses shake during the incident. The Rail Accidents Investigation Branch (RAIB) found that multiple failed screws led to a loss of track gauge restraint, allowing the wheels to fall off. They criticised Network Rail's inspection processes for not detecting these failures and noted poor local record-keeping, with many documents missing. Previous fatigue damage to these screws had gone unnoticed, despite earlier incidents. The RAIB made eight recommendations to improve staff training, review rail traffic impacts, and enhance inspection records. Network Rail has accepted the findings, completed necessary repairs, and upgraded their inspection regimes at similar sites to avoid future issues.
