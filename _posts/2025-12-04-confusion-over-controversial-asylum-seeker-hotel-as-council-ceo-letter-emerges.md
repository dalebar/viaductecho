There's been some tension in Trafford over the use of the Cresta Court Hotel for asylum seekers, particularly single adult males. The council's chief executive, Sara Todd, wrote to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressing concerns about financial pressure and community cohesion issues stemming from this arrangement. Despite her warnings about rising protests and local unrest, a Conservative motion to halt the hotel's use as temporary accommodation was shot down at a council meeting, backed by the controlling Labour group. Coun Nathan Evans of the Tories criticised Labour leadership for disregarding residents' concerns. Meanwhile, Green Coun Michael Welton condemned the inappropriate behaviour of some protesters, saying it crossed the line and fostered a hostile environment. Labour Deputy Leader, Coun Liz Patel, affirmed the council's commitment to community unity, insisting they've been responsive to the situation. Overall, it seems there's a real struggle between addressing asylum accommodation and maintaining local harmony in Trafford.
