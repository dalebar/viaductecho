Stockport's set to inspire a future generation of scientists with a new initiative from Kao Data, which is building a data centre in Reddish. They’ve launched the 'Kao Academy', an online resource for primary school kids aged 9-11, filled with lessons on science and tech, plus games and puzzles. To get kids even more involved, they're running a competition for schools across Greater Manchester, inviting students to design their own Data Centre Superhero. Winning schools could snag £100 Amazon vouchers, and there are STEM toy prizes for individual winners. Navendu Mishra, Stockport's MP, emphasised the importance of preparing youngsters for an AI-driven economy and praised the initiative for connecting kids with the tech industry. Lizzy McDowell from Kao Data highlighted the academy's goal to spark early interest in STEM subjects, particularly for underrepresented groups, addressing the talent shortage in the data centre sector. Overall, it’s a brilliant effort to inspire kids to consider careers in science and tech!
