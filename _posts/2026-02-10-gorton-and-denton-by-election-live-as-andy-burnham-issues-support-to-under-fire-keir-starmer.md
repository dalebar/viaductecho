The Gorton and Denton by-election is on February 26, following Labour MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation due to health issues and controversy over disparaging comments about constituents. The Labour Party is facing challenges, notably regarding Sir Keir Starmer's leadership amid the Peter Mandelson scandal. Despite calls for his resignation from figures like Anas Sarwar and Nigel Farage, many party leaders, including Andy Burnham, express their support for Starmer, advocating for unity and stability within the party. 

Labour's candidate, Angeliki Stogia, is joined by ten others in the election race, which features a mix of party affiliations. There's been tension over an unauthorised endorsement letter from a supposed reform candidate supporter, prompting an investigation from Greater Manchester Police. Overall, local concerns appear focused more on everyday issues rather than the national turmoil surrounding Labour's leadership. Political heavyweights are actively campaigning in the region, framing the election as a choice between hope and division, while discussions continue on the party's future direction in light of recent controversies.
