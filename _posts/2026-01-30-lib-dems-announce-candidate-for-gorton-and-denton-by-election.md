The Liberal Democrats have chosen local campaigner Jackie Pearcey as their candidate for the impending Gorton and Denton by-election, scheduled for February 26. Pearcey, who lives in the area and serves as the regional Lib Dems president, previously garnered 2,600 votes in the 2017 election. She's enthusiastic about tackling local issues like the cost of living and NHS improvements, emphasising that constituents deserve better than the current Labour government. This by-election was triggered by the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne following a scandal involving inappropriate comments shared within Labour. Meanwhile, Reform UK has selected journalist Matt Goodwin as their candidate, while Labour is deliberating between Eamon O’Brien and Angeliki Storgia. The Workers’ Party is considering either George Galloway or Shahbaz Sarwar for their nomination, and the Greens are set to announce their candidate soon.
