Snow across the UK caused transport chaos on Monday, with many areas waking up to ice and freezing temperatures. Liverpool John Lennon Airport had to shut its runway for several hours for snow clearance, while Manchester Airport managed to operate normally but advised passengers to allow extra travel time and keep an eye on flight updates. Some flights, particularly to Amsterdam, faced cancellations due to conditions at Schiphol.

The cold snap is set to linger as an Arctic air mass impacts the UK, with Manchester Airport prepared for any extreme weather. They monitor the conditions closely and use de-icing fluid to treat runways, as traditional grit isn't suitable for aircraft. Their snow-clearing fleet includes over 30 vehicles, like jet sweepers and ploughs, ready to tackle even a small amount of snow, which can quickly pile up. Extra staff are on standby, and with these wintery conditions expected to continue, passengers are reminded to be cautious and plan ahead for their journeys.
