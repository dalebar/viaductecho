Residents in Stockport and Greater Manchester are being invited to share their thoughts on future public transport initiatives through a consultation running until 9 March. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) is focusing on its Transport Strategy for 2050 and the 2027-37 transport delivery plan, which aim for 50% of all journeys to be made by public transport or active travel by 2040. The plan aims for 90% of peak-time trips into Manchester city centre to utilise the Bee Network. TfGM also envisions neighbourhoods designed for easy walking and wheeling, and pledges to make the Bee Network one of the safest transport systems globally, targeting a 95% safety satisfaction rate. Vernon Everitt, the Transport Commissioner, emphasised the importance of public feedback in shaping these ambitious plans. The survey closes at 11.59pm on 9 March, so residents are encouraged to share their views.
