Manchester Piccadilly station has reopened after a major upgrade, with thousands of commuters back in action. Over nine days, engineers replaced tracks, signalling systems, and points in the Ardwick area, marking a significant modernisation since the late 1980s. Simon Bennett, the station manager, mentioned the dedication of hundreds of workers around the clock and highlighted the improved reliability of train services. During the closure, almost 9,000 rail replacement bus services operated as platforms 1-12 were entirely shut to passenger trains. The upgrade is expected to make journeys smoother, with around 38 million journeys made last year and nearly 1,000 trains passing through daily. Additional routine work is scheduled for early March, which may affect services into the station until lunchtime. Overall, it’s a big boost for rail travel in the area!
