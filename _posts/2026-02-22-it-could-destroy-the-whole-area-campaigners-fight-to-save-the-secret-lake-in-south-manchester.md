Jeremy Hoad, a local resident, expresses concern over plans to develop the ‘Secret Lake’ area in Levenshulme and Reddish, which currently serves as a wildlife haven and community space. A proposal for 109 houses and 91 apartments could drastically change this cherished spot, beloved by families for generations. Many locals, including Claire Clark, worry about potential loss of green space in a densely urbanised area and question whether the affordable housing promised by developers, Northern Group, will genuinely benefit the community. She's particularly skeptical about the actual affordability of the homes, given local income levels. Additionally, residents fear increased congestion and habitat destruction.
