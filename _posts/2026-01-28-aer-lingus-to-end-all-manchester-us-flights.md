Aer Lingus has cancelled all flights between Manchester Airport and New York, effective from 23 February, and plans to end all transatlantic services from Manchester by 31 March. A replacement service from Dublin to Barbados will run from April to May for affected passengers. The airline apologised for the disruption and is in talks with staff representatives about service cuts and severance packages for Manchester-based employees. They are reassuring affected passengers, offering refunds or alternative flights, and emphasised their commitment to keep customers updated. Other Aer Lingus flights between Manchester and Ireland remain unaffected.
