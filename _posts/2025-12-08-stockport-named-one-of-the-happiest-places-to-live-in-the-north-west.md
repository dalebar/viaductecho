Stockport has made it onto the list of the happiest places to live in the North West, coming in seventh according to Rightmove's annual Happy at Home Index. The survey gathered feedback from thousands of locals across over 200 areas, highlighting the importance of community, safety, and access to essential services such as schools and healthcare. Notably, towns with walkable high streets and green spaces scored particularly well. While Altrincham, Macclesfield, and the Wirral topped the regional list, Stockport also landed 43rd overall in Great Britain. Residents expressed that feeling part of a community significantly impacts their happiness, with those living near parks or nature enjoying higher satisfaction. The survey underscores how a town's physical environment—like vibrant urban areas and accessible nature—plays a key role in residents’ well-being.
