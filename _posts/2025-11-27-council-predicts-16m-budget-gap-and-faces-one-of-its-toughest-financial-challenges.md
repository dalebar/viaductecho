Bury council is facing a challenging financial situation, with a projected £16m budget gap for 2026/27 due to rising costs, particularly in social care. About 70% of their budget goes to adults' and children's services, which are seeing increased demand. To address the deficit, the council is planning a 5% rise in council tax, alongside identifying £8.5m in savings and strategising to close the remaining £7.5m gap. They aim to maximise independence in care and reduce third-party costs, projecting savings of £3m over the next three years. Public consultation begins on December 4, with an emphasis on protecting vulnerable residents while improving efficiency and managing demand. Coun Sean Thorpe highlighted the importance of local decision-making and ongoing investment in the community to create a sustainable future.
