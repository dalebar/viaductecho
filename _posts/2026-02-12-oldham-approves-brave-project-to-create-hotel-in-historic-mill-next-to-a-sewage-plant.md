Developers are set to turn Oldham’s historic Ram Mill into a hotel, thanks to a £20m project. This transformation will convert the upper floors into 180 hotel rooms. The mill, over 120 years old and previously modernised into a business and retail centre, is near Oldham's wastewater processing plant. Councillors gave the thumbs-up to the planning proposal, with Councillor Marc Hince praising the developer's brave approach to revamping such an important site for the community. The plans include 75 double rooms and 105 aparthotel units targeted at business visitors. There'll also be flexible workspaces and common areas to enhance guest experience. Although not grade listed, the mill is seen as a significant local heritage asset. The development aims to conserve the building and promises economic boosts along with new job opportunities.
