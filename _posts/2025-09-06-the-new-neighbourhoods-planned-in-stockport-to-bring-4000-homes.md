Plans are progressing in Stockport to build around 4,000 new homes in the town centre east area, including affordable housing, as part of a major redevelopment project. The aim is to create a more vibrant community with natural spaces, a health hub, and pedestrian-friendly streets to promote healthy lifestyles. Key features of the project include a ‘riverside corridor’ and enhanced access to the Goyt River, as well as a focus on preserving Stockport’s heritage around the Piccadilly area. The Hillgate neighbourhood will see a ‘green connected’ area linking different parts of the town. The council and the Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation are leading this transformation to address underused land and prevent economic decline. Councillors have expressed the need for more affordable housing, emphasising this is a unique redevelopment opportunity. Overall, there are plans for a total of 8,000 new homes in Stockport over the next 15 years, with discussions on the town centre east plans scheduled for September 16.
