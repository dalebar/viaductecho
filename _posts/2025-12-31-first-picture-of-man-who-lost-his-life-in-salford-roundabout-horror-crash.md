Michael Page, 48, tragically lost his life in a car crash on New Year's Eve in Irlam, Salford. The accident occurred around 7:15 am when Mr Page's vehicle hit a roundabout, causing him to veer off the road. Despite the rapid response from emergency services, he could not be saved. A 50-year-old female passenger suffered critical injuries and is currently in hospital. Friends remember Mr Page as an "absolute legend," sharing heartfelt tributes on social media, reminiscing about good times and extending support to his family. The scene remains cordoned off for investigation, with Greater Manchester Police appealing for witnesses and anyone with relevant footage to come forward. They can be contacted directly or anonymously through Crimestoppers.
