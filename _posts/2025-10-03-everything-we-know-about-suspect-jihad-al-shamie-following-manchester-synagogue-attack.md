Further details about the Manchester synagogue attacker, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, have emerged following a devastating attack that left two dead and three injured. This incident unfolded outside the Heaton Park synagogue during Yom Kippur when Al-Shamie drove into worshippers and then launched a knife attack. Authorities confirmed he was wearing what appeared to be an explosive vest, but it was later deemed non-viable. Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, reportedly moved to the UK as a child and was granted citizenship in 2006. Early investigations show he hadnâ€™t been known to police or under any active investigation. Neighbours described him as a somewhat reclusive figure who lived with a family member and frequently exercised outdoors. At present, three men are in hospital with serious injuries, and police continue to investigate the motivations behind this shocking act of violence.
