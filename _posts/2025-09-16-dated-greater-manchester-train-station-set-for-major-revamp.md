Rochdale's train station, with a history dating back to 1839, is set for a major makeover. The Rochdale Development Agency wants to revamp the north entrance, adding a new 25m canopy with a green roof, planters, seating, and bike racks. This upgrade aims to address the station's dated look and improve way-finding and signage. Alongside this, there's a future plan to enhance an underpass. The station has always been a key transport hub, situated near bus and tram routes, making it essential for commuters and visitors. These improvements are part of a broader multi-million-pound regeneration project in the area, which includes building new homes and a public square. Coun Danny Meredith highlighted that this project will give a fresh feel to the station, match its importance, and promote biodiversity with green features. Overall, itâ€™s an exciting time for Rochdale as it looks to improve its transport connections and overall community space.
