Vex Coffee, a Stockport-based start-up, has just hit its one-year milestone! Founded by locals Ross Jamieson and John Bradshaw, the brand aims to bring speciality coffee to folks across the UK, especially outside major cities. They launched a monthly subscription box service, delivering two curated bags of high-quality coffee sourced from over 18 countries, including Ethiopia and Colombia. Both founders, who juggle their tech jobs with the coffee biz, taste-test every coffee to ensure subscribers receive fresh and varied selections. In just a year, Vex Coffee has grown its subscriber base by an impressive 250%, with a focus on fostering a community feel. Their subscription starts at £23.50 a month. Ross and John are keen to keep their members happy while partnering with more local roasters.
