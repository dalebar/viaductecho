The Bohemian Arts Club in Stockport is set to close this Friday, 3 October, to make way for an expansion of the Bohemian Salon upstairs. Founded by Tom Ogden from Blossoms and his wife Katie, the bar opened its doors in May 2023, specialising in cocktails. The announcement was shared on social media, expressing mixed emotions about the closure. While it’s sad to see the bar go after 2½ years of hosting celebrations, the owners are excited for the salon's growth and the space’s new direction. They cherish the memories made with customers and are looking forward to the future.
