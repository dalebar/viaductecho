Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, staunchly defends his handling of the grooming gang scandal, insisting safety for children is his top priority. At a recent Q&A, he responded to concerns that fear of being labelled racist hindered action against predominantly Pakistani Muslim gangs targeting white girls. Burnham firmly stated he has always put the safety of young women first and accused online critics of spreading hate. He highlighted that local reviews and police investigations have led to arrests and convictions, making communities safer. Despite these efforts, he acknowledged constraints with local inquiries lacking the power to compel evidence. Burnham called for a national inquiry for better accountability, contrasting it with his party's stance. Overall, he remains confident in the actions taken under his leadership, affirming, "Nothing is more important than the safety of kids."
