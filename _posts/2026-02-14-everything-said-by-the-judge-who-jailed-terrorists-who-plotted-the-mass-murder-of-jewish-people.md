A judge has sentenced two men, Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein, to life imprisonment for plotting a potential mass terror attack against the Jewish community in Manchester. The judge described their plan, which involved using AK47s at a pro-Israel march, as likely one of the deadliest in British history. Saadaoui was given a minimum term of 37 years before parole review, while Hussein must serve at least 26 years. Their plot was uncovered through an undercover police operation, where an operative posed as an accomplice. A third defendant, Bilel Saadaoui, received a six-year sentence for failing to report the plan. The judge highlighted the duo's antisemitic motivations and their intention to cause widespread harm. Both showed no remorse during the trial. The meticulous police work and bravery of the undercover operative were commended, as their actions helped prevent a significant tragedy.
