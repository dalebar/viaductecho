Keir Starmer expressed his shock over a synagogue attack in north Manchester on October 3, prompting him to return to the UK for an emergency Cobra meeting. The Prime Minister, who was attending a European leaders' meeting in Denmark, will also come back following the incident that injured four people when a car was driven into a crowd on Middleton Road, Crumpsall. Greater Manchester Police declared a major incident and activated their "Plato" protocol, typically used for potential terror attacks. Starmer condemned the act, particularly as it occurred on Yom Kippur, the most sacred day for Jews. Police were alerted at 9:31 am, with reports of a stabbing and a car attack. By 9:38 am, shots were fired, involving the alleged offender. A white lorry marked ‘Bomb Disposal’ arrived, while Mayor Andy Burnham confirmed the seriousness of the situation but reassured the public that the immediate danger seemed to be under control, praising the swift response by police and on-site security.
