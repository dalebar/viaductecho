In 2025, Oldham dealt with significant changes, but also faced considerable delays on major projects. The Oldham Coliseum didn't reopen for the panto season as planned due to asbestos and structural issues. Tommyfield traders were meant to move to a new venue, but delays meant they remained at their old market, leading to frustrations among stallholders. Despite these setbacks, the council launched various initiatives like a new park, ‘SportsTown’ at Boundary Park, and housing developments to tackle the housing crisis. There was also the reopening of the renovated town hall as the JR Clynes Building. Council leader Arooj Shah acknowledged public concerns over broken promises in regeneration projects but emphasized the importance of doing things right for sustainable outcomes. Meanwhile, a new school project, initially stalled for budget reviews, was finally greenlit towards the end of the year. While progress may have slowed, there's a shared hope that these setbacks will lead to thriving developments in the future.
