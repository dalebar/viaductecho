Oldham Council is facing heavy criticism over disturbing deprivation statistics showing the borough's situation is worsening. Recent data ranked Oldham as the 11th most deprived area in England, a drop from 19th. Councillor Sykes has urged the council to focus on jobs, training, and skills to combat this decline, noting that nearly 40% of neighbourhoods are now among the ten most deprived in the area. Even historically affluent regions like Saddleworth have seen declines. The council's low scores in "Income" and "Employment" categories are linked to a long-term decline in job opportunities and wages.

In response, Council leader Coun Arooj Shah accused Sykes of political grandstanding, pointing out the impact of years of austerity and cuts. She claims the council is actively working to improve the situation, highlighting initiatives like Get Oldham Working, a jobs fair, and plans aimed at job creation and skills development. The conversation is heating up as both sides try to navigate the best path forward for the borough.
