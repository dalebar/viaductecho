Manchester Pride organisers have announced they’ve gone bust, putting the future of one of the UK’s major LGBT events in jeopardy. They expressed their sadness in a statement shared with artists, contractors, and suppliers involved in the event. Saki Yew, a contestant from RuPaul's Drag Race UK 2024, mentioned she hasn’t received any updates regarding her fee. Although detailed financial info isn't released yet, reports indicate a loss of about £468,000 in 2023.
