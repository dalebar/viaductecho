The family of Michael Barron, who tragically died on January 26 last year, has shared their heartfelt memories during the trial of Josh Baxter, accused of unlawfully killing him. The court heard that after meeting on Grindr, Baxter allegedly choked Michael during sex, leading to his death from cardiac arrest. While Baxter was acquitted of manslaughter, he was found guilty of intentional strangulation and grievous bodily harm. Michael's family, including his mum, Mary, and siblings, stressed that he was much more than the circumstances surrounding his death. They highlighted his dream of being an actor, his kindness, and his influence within the LGBT community, especially in his small Irish hometown. Michael was known for his vibrant personality, love for family, and passion for performance. He had recently started a course with an LGBTQ+ radio station, showing promise in a field he adored. The family expressed their gratitude towards the Greater Manchester Police for their support throughout the ordeal. As Baxter awaits sentencing next month, they hope to remind the world that Michael's life was about love, laughter, and being unapologetically himself.
