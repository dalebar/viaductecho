Families of victims from the Manchester Arena bombing have expressed disappointment in the proposed Hillsborough Law, particularly regarding its exemptions for intelligence services. After meeting with Sir Keir Starmer, campaigners like Ruth Leney emphasised that they need complete accountability, fearing that any loopholes would undermine the law's effectiveness. Critics argue that the draft law could let security chiefs cover up failures under the guise of national security. Although Starmer affirmed that the duty of candour should apply to intelligence services and proposed amendments, campaigners believe these changes still leave too much power in the hands of service heads to decide what to disclose. The debate on the law, named after the Hillsborough disaster that claimed 97 lives, has been postponed until January to allow for further government adjustments that may address these concerns. Families continue to call for a robust law, insisting that no one should be above accountability, especially after tragic events like the Manchester Arena bombing, where intelligence failings played a significant role.
