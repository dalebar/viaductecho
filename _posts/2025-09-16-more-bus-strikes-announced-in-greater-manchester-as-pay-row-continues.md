Unite, the union for bus workers, has announced three new strike dates affecting Manchester's Bee Network bus service from September 30 to October 2, adding to ongoing strikes starting this week. More than 2,000 Unite members will walk out over pay issues, impacting two-thirds of bus services in Greater Manchester, including school buses. Services in all boroughs except Bolton and Wigan will be affected, causing major disruption. The union claims bus operators First, Metroline, and Stagecoach have failed to provide acceptable pay offers despite being profitable. Strikes may coincide with significant events like a Manchester United match and a comedy gig, adding to the chaos as students move in for freshers' week. In response, Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) is providing alternative travel options, allowing passengers with various bus passes to use trams on strike days. TfGMâ€™s chief officer urged the operators to negotiate to avoid disruption, emphasising the need for passengers to plan ahead due to limited bus availability.
