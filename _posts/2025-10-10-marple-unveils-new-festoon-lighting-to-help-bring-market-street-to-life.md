Market Street in Marple has been brightened up with new festoon lighting, designed to liven up the area during the evenings. The project, led by Marple Fest and supported by Stockport Council, was funded through various sources including the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, local budgets, crowdfunding, and the Marple Beer Run in memory of Tommy Tognarelli. Cllr Colin Macalister praised the initiative as a brilliant example of community spirit, highlighting the collaboration between residents, businesses, and volunteers. The lights are expected to enhance the evening atmosphere, support community events, and improve safety. A spokesperson for Marple Fest expressed gratitude for the contributions from local businesses and the community, especially the Tognarelli family. This project truly shows what can happen when the community and Council come together.
