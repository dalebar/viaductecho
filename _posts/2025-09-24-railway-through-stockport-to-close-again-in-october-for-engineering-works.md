The railway network through Stockport will be closed from 4th to 5th October 2025 for essential engineering works on the Greek Street bridge and roundabout. Engineers will be removing a now-redundant wall in the centre of the tracks and starting work on the road and walls above the bridge. Passengers are advised to check their travel plans with the National Rail journey planner. Network Rail's project manager, William Brandon, expressed gratitude for passengers' patience, noting that while the bridge reconstruction is done, further work requires a short closure. Following this, utility companies will be involved in redirecting services before the road can be reopened. These latest closures follow a previous three-week railway shutdown in August for bridge upgrades, with more work scheduled over Christmas. Greek Street will stay closed to vehicles until Spring 2026 but remains open for pedestrians.
