Councillors in Stockport are considering installing retractable bollards near the scenic Marple canal locks to tackle issues with abandoned cars and rubbish dumping. The area, close to the Aqueduct Business Park, has faced complaints about vehicles being left there, some linked to bodyshop repairs, and heaps of waste. Recently, the Canal and River Trust reported ongoing conflicts with local tenants over the abandoned vehicles, which have returned despite previous removals at significant cost. During a recent area committee meeting, Coun Steve Gribbon highlighted the problem, emphasising better communication with the Trust was needed. The suggestion of installing bollards aims to restrict vehicle access and curb further nuisance. Fly-tipping has also become an eyesore, with various waste like fridges and tyres piled up, attracting pests and detracting from the area’s natural beauty. Overall, there’s a push to maintain the charm of Marple while addressing these local concerns.
