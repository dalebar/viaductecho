Claire Reid, a Tameside councillor for nearly 20 years from the Labour Party, has resigned from her position representing the Denton South ward. Because her term ends in May 2026, there won't be a by-election to fill her seat. This decision means the seat will be contested during the local elections in May 2026. The council specified that a by-election only occurs if more than one ward seat is vacant, and Reid's resignation falls within six months of her term ending, which legally prevents a by-election. Claire clarified that her resignation isn't linked to the recent Labour Party fallout involving a controversial WhatsApp group she participated in. She chose to step down to embark on a new chapter in her life away from politics, expressing pride in her achievements, particularly in community development. Reid and other councillors were suspended following the scandal, but she later returned to the Labour Party.
