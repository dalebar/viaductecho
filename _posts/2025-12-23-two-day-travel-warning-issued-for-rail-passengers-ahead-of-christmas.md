Train passengers heading across the Pennines for Christmas are advised to plan ahead, as major engineering works are shutting down railway lines between Manchester and Leeds until December 24. This impacts all routes via Huddersfield, with no TransPennine Express services running between Manchester and Leeds during this time. Many services that usually travel through Huddersfield will now terminate there, and some trains from Newcastle, Scarborough, and York will also end earlier in Yorkshire. Rail replacement buses are available in affected areas. Additionally, Northern services from Manchester Victoria to Leeds are being diverted via Bradford, and local services in West Yorkshire are experiencing disruptions. Passengers should check for the latest updates on their journeys before heading out.
