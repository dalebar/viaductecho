Greater Manchester Police seized 150 cannabis plants during a raid on a property on Golborne Avenue in Withington, south Manchester, on February 17. The operation, led by the City of Manchester South Neighbourhood Policing Team, was initiated based on community intelligence about drug supply and anti-social behaviour in the area. While no arrests have been made, the plants have been taken for testing, aiming to disrupt further drug-related activities. PC Sean McDonald emphasised the vital role of community support in directing police efforts. The investigation is ongoing, and GMP encourages anyone with additional information to reach out via various contact methods.
