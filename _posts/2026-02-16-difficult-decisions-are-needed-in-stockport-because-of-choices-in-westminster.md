Stockport Council is facing a tough financial situation, dealing with a £75m funding gap over the next five years. This year alone, it needs to find £20m to balance its £356m budget amid rising service costs. Leaders are blaming the government’s ‘fairer funding’ review for worsening their situation, claiming the £26m funding increase expected by 2028/29 isn’t enough.

To tackle the deficit, the council plans a 4.99% rise in council tax, adding over £100 annually for band D households, which includes a specific increase for adult social care. They’re also reviewing parking charges in the town centre, hoping to save £500,000, although this has caused concerns among residents and traders about its impact on local business.

Councillors have expressed disappointment over their funding appeals to the government, suggesting Stockport is getting less support compared to other areas. The council's budget will be voted on February 26, as they struggle to secure financial stability and potentially need to ask for exceptional government help.
