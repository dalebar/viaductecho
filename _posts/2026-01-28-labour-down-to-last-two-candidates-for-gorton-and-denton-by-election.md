The two Labour candidates for the Gorton and Denton by-election have been confirmed as Eamon O’Brien, Bury council leader, and Angeliki Stogia, Whalley Range councillor. The announcement was made by deputy Labour leader and Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell, who emphasised their local roots and commitment to delivering change as they campaign to replace Andrew Gwynne. The shortlist was narrowed down from five candidates, following the blocking of Andy Burnham’s bid. O’Brien and Stogia will debate at a hustings on Saturday, January 31, with the winner set to represent Labour in the by-election on February 26. Other confirmed candidates include Matt Goodwin from Reform, Shahbaz Sarwar from the Worker’s Party, and Melissa Poulton for the Greens.
