The Manchester Christmas Markets have been bustling for over five weeks, with a standout stall being the French Toast one in Albert Square, which has returned after six years. Marked by a pink Eiffel Tower, it's been drawing huge crowds and is popular on social media for its Instagrammable cones of diced French toast, priced from £8.50. These delicious bites come in various toppings, including a special Biscoff option we tried for £9.50, which offered a generous portion of warm, fluffy bites. They might be a bit messy to eat, especially with all the toppings, but they’re quite shareable. The stall also serves hot chocolates and other drinks, adding to its popularity. With only a week left of the markets, it's still a great time to visit as most stalls close on December 22, but a few, including this one, will be around until January 4, 2026. Worth the wait for sure!
