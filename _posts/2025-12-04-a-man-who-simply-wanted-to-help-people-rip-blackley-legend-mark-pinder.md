Mark Pinder, a beloved figure in Blackley, passed away at 54, leaving a huge impact on his community. Known for his kindness, despite being homeless, he helped the elderly, cleaned streets, and ensured everyone felt safe. Since his death on November 30, tributes have poured in, with many wanting to rename a woodland area he cherished as "Pinder's Woods." His sister highlighted the immense love and respect he garnered from locals, noting that hundreds are expected at his funeral. While he had opportunities for housing, Mark preferred to stay close to the community he adored. A memorial has been set up in his honour, filled with flowers and balloons. The family plans to start a fundraiser to support a soup kitchen and help families afford Christmas presents, honouring Mark's legacy of giving back.
