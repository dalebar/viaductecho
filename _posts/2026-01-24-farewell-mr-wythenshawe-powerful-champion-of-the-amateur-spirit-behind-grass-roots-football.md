Tributes are pouring in for John Walker, affectionately known as Mr Wythenshawe, a dedicated champion of amateur football and a key figure at Wythenshawe Amateurs, now Wythenshawe FC. His journey with the club began in 1946 at just nine years old, and over 80 years, he took on almost every role, from player to president. John's efforts helped the club grow significantly, culminating in the development of its permanent home, the Hollyhedge Park Community Stadium. He was instrumental in securing funding for the stadium and worked tirelessly to improve the club's facilities. Known for his strong morals and work ethic, John was passionate about amateur football and even played alongside his son at 51. His love for the club, its values, and the community it built were clear throughout his life. Sadly, John passed away in a care home at 88, after battling Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. He leaves behind his wife Christine, their three children, and six grandchildren. The heartfelt messages on the club's Facebook page reflect his status as a true club legend. His funeral is set for February 11 at Manchester Crematorium.
