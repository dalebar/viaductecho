A new shop, Underbank General Store, has opened on Lower Hillgate in Stockport Underbanks, launched by Lauren, Nam, and their dog Paak on December 17, 2023. They previously ran a trial day on December 16 to iron out any issues. The store offers a range of products, from everyday essentials to artisanal brands, inspired by requests from bar customers. Lauren, who’s passionate about the Stockport community, hopes to enhance it with their new venture. Paak the dog is a charming welcome for shoppers, eager for a bit of attention. Though first-time retailers, Lauren and Nam’s experience running the adjacent bar, Ōdiobā—part coffee shop, part bar—equips them well for their new business.
