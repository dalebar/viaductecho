Hashem Abedi, linked to the Manchester Arena bombing, skipped a court hearing after being charged with attempting to murder prison officers at HMP Frankland. The 28-year-old, who faces three counts of attempted murder, one assault charge, and one for possessing a weapon, allegedly injured four staff members during an ambush with hot oil and makeshift weapons on April 12. His case was pushed back after he failed to appear via video link, and the Chief Magistrate assured he would be present at the next hearing on September 25, either in person or through video. Abedi is already serving a life sentence for his role in the 2017 terror attack that killed 22 people.
