At Platt Bridge Community School in Wigan, kids were kept inside on Thursday due to reports of a man with a gun in the area. The school clarified that this was a precaution following police advice, stemming from a false report. Headteacher Stephen Wallace assured parents there was no direct threat to the school, students, or staff, and that heightened security measures were put in place until the situation was resolved. The police confirmed later that there was no danger to the wider community. Wallace stressed the school's priority is the safety and security of the children during such incidents.
