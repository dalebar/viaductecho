A massive 32-foot sinkhole has emerged on Briscoe Lane in Newton Heath, Manchester, following a burst pipe. The hole measures about 32ft long, 18ft wide, and 9ft deep, prompting a 20-metre cordon around it. Workers have started filling the sinkhole, but the road remains closed. Residents nearby are facing water supply issues, with reports of low pressure and difficulties using heating. United Utilities has delivered water buckets but acknowledges it's not enough, promising to sort the problems soon. Local businesses are suffering too, with closures leading to appointment cancellations. The water company is carrying out repairs, using tankers to supply water, and has apologised for the inconvenience caused. Manchester City Council is also aware of the situation.
