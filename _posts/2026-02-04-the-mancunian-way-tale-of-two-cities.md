Today’s newsletter kicks off with breaking news: a light aircraft crashed in Littleborough this afternoon, with two people on board. There's a big emergency response at the scene, and the condition of those involved is unclear. Witnesses reported a parachute was seen before the crash. 

Shifting gears, we dive into the city's gentrification debate, sparked by a Reddit post featuring contrasting photos of Atlas bar over a decade. Critics say new skyscrapers overwhelm Manchester's charm, while supporters claim they boost economy and housing. Mayor Andy Burnham is concerned about ensuring growth benefits all Mancunians, as seen in the candidacy announcement of Angeliki Stogia for Gorton and Denton. A seasoned councillor, she aims to tackle issues like the cost of living and local transport.

In other news, disturbing videos capturing women on nights out continue to emerge, highlighting challenges in privacy rights and legal limitations. Meanwhile, a case where two homeless men were denied a hotel booking has prompted calls for change. 

Weather-wise, expect light clouds and 9C. Just a heads up, A56 Deansgate northbound is closed until 2026 due to roadworks.
