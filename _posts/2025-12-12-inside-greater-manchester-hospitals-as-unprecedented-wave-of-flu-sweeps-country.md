Hospitals in Manchester are experiencing a significant surge in flu cases, with over 100 beds occupied daily. This increase has led to A&Es seeing double the usual admissions, as reported by senior health figures. Last week, an average of 164 flu patients were in hospitals, marking a 48% rise from the previous week, indicating a more virulent strain that people are less immune to. The NHS is facing pressure, described as a 'worst-case scenario'. The total number of flu patients in England has also hit record levels, jumping 55% in a week. There's concern over the upcoming strikes by resident doctors, which could intensify the pressure on services. Health leaders are urging the public to get the flu vaccine, practice good hygiene, and use resources like NHS 111. This situation highlights the ongoing strain on the NHS, with staff working hard to manage the demand amidst winter viruses.
