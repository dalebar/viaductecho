Merseyway's Pop-Up Uniform Shop had a smashing success this year, selling 3,000 items and raising £1,270 for charity, including Chelwood Foodbank Plus and Stockport ARC Centre. Open from 8-15 August in the Merseyway shopping centre, the shop offered affordable uniforms starting at just 50p. It's a yearly event before school, where all items are donated by locals, helping families gear up for the school year without breaking the bank. This year saw a 7% increase in footfall compared to 2024, and over 100 hours of volunteer work contributed to its success. Cllr Wendy Meikle praised the shop as a crucial resource for families, while Centre Manager Victoria Nichol expressed gratitude for the community's generosity, highlighting the strong spirit of Stockport.
