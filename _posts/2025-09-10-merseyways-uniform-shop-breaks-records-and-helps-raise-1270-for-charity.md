Merseyway's Pop Up Uniform Shop had a smashing success this year, selling 3,000 items and raising £1,270 for charity! Open from 8-15 August, the shop offered uniform essentials for as little as 50p, with all items donated by locals. The funds have been split between Chelwood Foodbank Plus and the Stockport ARC Centre, helping families in the area. This annual event saw a 7 percent rise in foot traffic compared to last year and over 100 hours of volunteer support from Merseyway staff and local businesses. Councillor Wendy Meikle praised the shop as a lifeline for families, ensuring kids head back to school in good-quality uniforms without putting too much strain on parents’ wallets. Centre Manager Victoria Nichol expressed delight at the community's generosity, emphasising the town's spirit and commitment to supporting each other. What a brilliant way to kick off the school year!
