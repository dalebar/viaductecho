Manchester Unitedâ€™s recent form has been concerning, with only two Premier League wins since April, but stats hint at some underlying improvement under Ruben Amorim. Despite some games being skewed, like against 10-man Bournemouth, the team seems to struggle both in creating and converting chances. This may point to issues with player quality, confidence, or just bad luck. Although the expected goal numbers suggest the players should be performing better, they are currently the worst at both creating and finishing chances. While improving shot quality will be key, simply dominating possession doesn't guarantee success, as goals are what truly count in football. Ultimately, United needs to translate their expected performance into actual goals to turn their fortunes around.
