Manchester United's recent form under Ruben Amorim is puzzling, with only two wins in the Premier League since April, yet stats suggest some improvement. Despite a couple of matches where opponents went down to ten men, recent performances raise questions about the players' quality, confidence, and perhaps even bad luck. The club's struggle lies in both creating and converting chances, reflected in their poor expected goal stats, indicating they should be performing better. It highlights a pressing need for renewal this summer, especially in attacking positions. Ultimately, while United's dominance in games is noted, what really counts is actually scoring goals, and the club must sharpen its finishing to avoid becoming prisoners of bad luck or underperformance going forward.
