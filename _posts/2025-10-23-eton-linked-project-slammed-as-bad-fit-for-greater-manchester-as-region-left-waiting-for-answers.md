The plan to build an Eton-linked school, Eton Star Academy, in Oldham town centre has hit a snag, waiting for government approval for over a year. The new school aims to support disadvantaged kids in reaching top universities and is set to occupy a site next to Tommyfield Market, funded by the government and Eton’s £1m contribution. However, local Liberal Democrats, led by Councillor Howard Sykes, have criticised the project, calling for it to be cancelled in favour of better local educational options like vocational courses and apprenticeships. They believe the initiative is more about Eton maintaining its charity status than genuinely helping Oldham’s youth. Meanwhile, Oldham's council leadership insists the school will enhance educational opportunities, while Eton's headteacher highlighted the intention to support bright students from challenging backgrounds. As the government remains tight-lipped on its decision, local MP Jim McMahon has sought updates from the Department for Education.
