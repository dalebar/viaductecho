Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is hosting 'Mayor's Question Time' at Edgeley Park on Thursday, 18 September at 7.30pm, and itâ€™s free to attend. During this Q&A event, the mayor will tackle questions from the public. Attendees can submit their questions when registering, which will then be shortlisted by a local journalist to cover a variety of topics. There's also a chance to ask additional questions on the night. Participants are asked to keep it to one concise and relevant question. While early registration is recommended, walk-ins are welcome if space allows. These events are held every three months in different locations across Greater Manchester, providing a great opportunity for locals to voice their concerns.
