Helen Tither was inspired by an article in the Manchester Evening News about the pioneering Manchester Corinthians Ladies Football Club while fundraising for a documentary. After four years of hard work, their story will hit the big screen as "The Corinthians: We Were The Champions," showcasing the club's struggles and successes since its establishment in 1949, despite a 1921 ban on women’s football. The film highlights the team’s resilience, defying the odds with makeshift facilities and playing charity matches worldwide. Featuring ten surviving players sharing their experiences, it’s backed by artists like Manchester punk band Loose Articles and comes with rare archival material. The film will have its VIP premiere at HOME on February 26th, followed by a public screening on March 5th that sold out quickly, prompting the addition of more dates. Against historical opposition, the Corinthians emerged as early trailblazers for women's football and have been described by Greater Manchester's Mayor as “football suffragettes.” With its unique perspective, the documentary aims to finally give these legendary players the recognition they deserve.
