This weekend in Stockport looks a bit of a mixed bag! Kicking off on Friday, expect cloudy skies with mild temperatures around 20°C, though it could feel a bit humid. Saturday brings the rain, with temperatures dropping to a high of 17°C and a 97% chance of precipitation—definitely keep your brolly handy! Sunday starts with more early morning showers, but things might clear up later in the day, with a cooler high of 14°C. 

For anyone commuting, Friday's your best bet if you fancy avoiding wind, but Saturday could be tricky with all that rain. Sunday morning might be damp, but the afternoon should be better for getting out and about. Overall, it’s a good idea to plan for indoor activities over the weekend, especially on Saturday. Enjoy the weekend and stay dry!
