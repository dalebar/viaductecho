Residents around Arncliffe Rise in Moorside, Oldham, are frustrated as a privately owned plot has become an ugly dumping ground for abandoned caravans and rubble, sparking fears of anti-social behaviour. After spending nearly a year raising concerns, locals feel powerless as the site attracts issues like suspected arson. A planning application to build houses was rejected due to community objections, and while the council has issued enforcement orders, progress has stalled as the landowner disputes the claims. Some debris has been cleared, but the caravans remain. Councillor Josh Charters has expressed understanding for residents' concerns and urged the landowner to collaborate with the council. Meanwhile, the developer, Saddleworth Holdings Ltd, stands firm on their legality and has submitted a new proposal for bungalows and community space, which locals oppose. Everyone's just hoping for a resolution to get their neighbourhood back on track.
