This weekend in Stockport looks to be a mixed bag, weather-wise. 

**Friday** starts off with some morning rain, a high of 19°C, and a low of 10°C. High humidity at 77% means you'll want that umbrella if you're heading out. Gentle winds will cap at 13mph.

**Saturday** is much brighter with cloudy skies but no rain, reaching a high of 20°C and a low of 12°C. Humidity drops slightly to 73% and winds will be a bit brisk at 17mph, making it a lovely day for outdoor plans.

**Sunday** shifts back to a partly cloudy outlook with a good chance of rain. Temperatures will hover between 21°C and 17°C, with humidity back at 77% and winds strong at 23mph. 

**Commuting tip**: Fridays might be tricky due to morning rain, but Saturday’s clear up should ease travel. Prepare for a slow commute on Sunday with anticipated showers and gusty winds. So, grab your coat and keep your plans flexible!
