Droylsden might soon see a new swimming pool pop up in an old Bright House retail unit. Swim!, a leisure company focused on teaching kids to swim, has applied to convert the vacant space at Droylsden Shopping Centre into a 618 square metre facility, featuring a swimming pool, changing areas, and more. They reckon this could bring a buzz back to the town centre and utilise a long-empty unit.

Planning documents highlight the benefits for community health and social interaction. Tameside Council is expected to make a decision in the coming months.
