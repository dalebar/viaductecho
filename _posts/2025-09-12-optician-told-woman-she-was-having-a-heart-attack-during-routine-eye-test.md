Norma, a woman from Stockport, discovered she was having a heart attack during a routine eye test, thanks to a new trial that includes blood pressure checks. Feeling unwell, she decided to get her eyes tested, and her optician suggested a blood pressure check, which revealed dangerously high levels. This led to an urgent hospital visit where the heart attack was confirmed. Norma called it a "miracle" and urged others to get their blood pressure checked. The pilot programme, running in Greater Manchester and other areas, aims to identify undiagnosed hypertension and has reportedly saved 44 lives in the first eight months. The initiative, backed by local health services, showcases how optometry can enhance healthcare, aligning with the NHSâ€™s goals for better community health.
