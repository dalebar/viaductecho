Trafford council is set to give the green light to the Urmston Plan, aimed at revitalising the town centre over the next 15 years. The plan, shaped by consultations with locals and businesses, highlights major redevelopment ideas, including transforming Urmston Market and enhancing public spaces on Flixton Road and Crofts Bank Road. Residents are keen on improvements like raised crossings, outdoor seating for cafes, more greenery, and better nighttime lighting. Coun Liz Patel noted strong community engagement, with 250 attendees at a consultation event and over 400 questionnaire responses. The plan's goal is to maintain Urmston’s unique identity while fostering an inclusive and vibrant town centre that supports both economic and social well-being. The council is committed to helping property owners revitalise key sites to enhance the town's appeal and sustainability.
