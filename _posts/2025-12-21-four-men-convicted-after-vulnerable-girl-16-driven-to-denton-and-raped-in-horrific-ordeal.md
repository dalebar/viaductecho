Four men, including Shiraz Nassir from Denton in Greater Manchester, face significant prison sentences after being convicted for raping and sexually exploiting a 16-year-old girl. The girl, who had run away from home, was initially approached by Nassir and his associates in Birmingham. After a series of encounters, she was coerced into a car where she was assaulted by Zaffar and Nadim before being taken to a remote area and raped by both Zaffar and Nassir. The abuse continued in hotels across Walsall and Birmingham. Detectives worked diligently, using phone records and other evidence to identify the offenders. Zaffar, who faced multiple charges including five counts of rape, along with Nadim, Arif, and Nassir, were all found guilty after a trial. The police commended the victim for her bravery in reporting the abuse, highlighting the traumatic experience she endured. The sentencing for the four men is set for March next year.
