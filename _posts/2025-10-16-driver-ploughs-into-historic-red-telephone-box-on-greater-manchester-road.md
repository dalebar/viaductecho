A historic red telephone box in Dobcross, Saddleworth, was wrecked after a silver Vauxhall Astra collided with it on October 15. Thankfully, no injuries were reported and no arrests were made. The car only sustained minor damage, but the phone box, a community landmark that has housed a defibrillator since 2016, didnâ€™t fare as well. Red telephone boxes, a staple of UK streets since the 1920s, have been phased out since the 1980s. On the following day, Greater Manchester Police attended another incident nearby where a vehicle overturned, sending a 65-year-old driver to hospital.
