Salford City FC is upset with North Yorkshire Police over their investigation into an alleged racial abuse incident against player Adebola Oluwo during a match against York. After the police concluded there was no evidence to support Oluwo's claims, the club expressed disappointment, as they have several first-hand accounts contradicting this finding, including from match officials. Salford has requested an independent review to reconsider the police's decision not to charge the individual involved, receiving support from various organisations, including the EFL and anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out. The club emphasised their commitment to combating racism in football and stated that they will pursue all avenues for accountability. No further comments will be made for now, while North Yorkshire Police have refrained from additional commentary.
