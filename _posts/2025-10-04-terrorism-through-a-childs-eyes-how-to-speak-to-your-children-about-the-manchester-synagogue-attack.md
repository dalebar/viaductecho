The recent synagogue attack in Manchester has left many feeling unsettled, especially kids who may find it even scarier than adults. Kids pick up on adult worries, often hearing playground chatter or worrying over tough conversations at home. Experts advise that there's no one-size-fits-all approach; itâ€™s important to talk to children based on their age and understanding. Sarie Taylor, a local psychotherapist, suggests several strategies for parents to help their kids cope. Key steps include acknowledging their feelings, providing age-appropriate explanations, and guiding healthy social media use to avoid overwhelming content. Sticking to normal routines can add a sense of stability, while focusing on positive actions helps kids feel empowered. Parents should also take care of their own wellbeing, as their calmness can provide essential support to their children. If anxiety persists, seeking professional help can be crucial. Overall, fostering open conversations and instilling resilience can help kids navigate these tough times.
