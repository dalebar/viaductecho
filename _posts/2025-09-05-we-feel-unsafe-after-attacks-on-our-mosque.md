Two recent attacks on Elaf Mosque in Cheadle Heath, Greater Manchester, have left the local Muslim community feeling unsafe, according to Dr AbdelNasser Ibrahim, the imam. In the latest incident, CCTV captured two masked individuals smashing the mosque's windows with paving slabs. Another attack in April involved rubbish and pork being thrown inside the mosque. Dr Ibrahim has urged for support from police, the council, and the community, emphasising the need for a peaceful environment free from Islamophobia. He expressed concerns for safety, noting that the mosque, which has been operational for about six months after its conversion from a church, has fostered a good relationship with locals. Dr Ibrahim highlighted the mosque's community efforts, such as children's programmes and distributing gifts during Ramadan, and reassured neighbours that it is a welcoming place for all. Greater Manchester Police are investigating both incidents.
