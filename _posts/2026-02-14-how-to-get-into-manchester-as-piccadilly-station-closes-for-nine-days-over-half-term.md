Manchester Piccadilly train station is closing for nine days starting today, February 14, for a major £8 million renovation, aimed at enhancing reliability. During this closure, trains from the south and east won’t be running into the station, with services redirecting to Stockport, Crewe, and Guide Bridge, among others. Platforms 1-12 will be out of action until February 22, while reduced services will run from Platforms 13 and 14. There are some planned closures on March 1 and March 22 as well.

In the meantime, Metrolink trams continue to operate normally, and valid rail tickets will be accepted on various Bee Network buses covering key routes. Rail replacement bus services will connect major locations like Stockport and Manchester Airport, departing from the station approach. Though some train routes from other operations like Manchester Victoria may be impacted, those stations remain open. Commuters are encouraged to plan ahead, with TfGM’s Journey Planner available for bus and tram travel.
