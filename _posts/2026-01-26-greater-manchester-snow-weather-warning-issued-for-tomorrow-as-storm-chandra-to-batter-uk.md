There's a weather warning for snow and rain in Greater Manchester as Storm Chandra heads our way. The Met Office has flagged it up before it hits tomorrow (Tuesday), predicting heavy rain, strong winds, and significant snow in parts of the region, particularly on higher ground. The yellow warning’s in effect from midnight to 5pm tomorrow. Rain's expected to start around 3am, lasting till at least noon. While low levels might not see much snow, higher areas could get a solid 2-20 cm. Strong winds could cause more travel disruption, especially on elevated routes. Across the UK, there are further warnings, with gusts of up to 80mph in some places. Met Office's Paul Gundersen stressed the importance of staying updated with forecasts, as conditions could change rapidly. So, keep an eye on that weather, folks!
