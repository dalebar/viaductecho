Stockport is eyeing green belt land to meet housing targets set by the Labour government, which has prompted a major shift in the borough's local plan for future developments. The council has identified 27 sites for nearly 9,000 new homes, with one village potentially seeing at least 1,000 new builds. Council leader Mark Roberts, from the Lib Dems, claims they’re being compelled to use protected land despite preferring a ‘brownfield first’ approach. Recent targets have nearly doubled the annual housing requirement to 1,906 homes, creating a significant shortfall against local needs. The council's draft local plan anticipates a total of 16,406 new homes but reveals a shortfall of over 15,000. Discussions on the draft will take place soon, leading to a public consultation scheduled for late 2025. Potential sites for development and their minimum housing contributions have all been outlined, marking a big change for Stockport.
