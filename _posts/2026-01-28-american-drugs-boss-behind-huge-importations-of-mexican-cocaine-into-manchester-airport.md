A plot by Mexican and American gangs to flood the UK with cocaine through Manchester Airport has been exposed. The scheme involved US citizens smuggling hundreds of kilos of cocaine from Cancun, with seven Americans jailed for their roles. Notably, a criminal named ‘Nate’ coordinated the operation. Four men from the UK—two Albanian nationals from Liverpool, Dale Hosker from Bury, and Dale Creen from Salford—were convicted for collecting and distributing the drugs upon their arrival. 

In a significant bust, on May 11, 2024, couriers brought in suitcases containing 100kg of cocaine. A case left behind led to the seizure of 20 kilos. Another attempt on May 31 saw 12 suitcases worth £24 million arrive, with only one courier succeeding. The offenders were caught after a lengthy National Crime Agency investigation, which included CCTV evidence and discoveries of weaponry at Creen's home. Sentencing is forthcoming, with the NCA highlighting the extensive efforts to combat the growing threat of Class A drugs.
