So, there's this ongoing issue with flooding on Cornbrook Road in Trafford, a main route to a Metrolink station. Despite photos showing folks wading through ankle-deep water, Trafford Council asserts that the situation doesn’t hit their 'intervention levels' for repairs. A regular commuter has been raising concerns for years, highlighting how the floods regularly block access to the tram stop. They mention an alternative route through a rough scrap yard that feels unsafe after dark. The council initially dismissed the complaint but later admitted to a mix-up, stating they cleared some water and plan further maintenance. Metrolink says the responsibility lies with the council and is encouraging complaints to them instead. The commuter is frustrated, calling the council's response inadequate, especially considering the taxes and fares they pay. There’s a real sense that many locals feel let down by the lack of prompt action on what appears to be a long-standing problem.
