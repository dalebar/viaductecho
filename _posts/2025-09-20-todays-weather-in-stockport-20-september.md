On Saturday in Stockport, expect mostly cloudy skies with a high chance of rain all day. Temps will range from 11°C to 16°C, giving a cool vibe, while humidity hits 89%—pretty muggy, really. Winds will be breezy at 14 mph, making it feel even chillier. 

If you’re commuting, best pack an umbrella and wear a waterproof jacket, as the rain is pretty much a guarantee. Drive carefully, as the wet roads could be slippery. 

For those choosing to stay in, it's a great day for indoor fun—think reading, cooking, or binge-watching your fav shows. If you have to go outside, make sure you’re dressed for the weather with layers and good waterproof shoes. Enjoy the cosy autumn day!
