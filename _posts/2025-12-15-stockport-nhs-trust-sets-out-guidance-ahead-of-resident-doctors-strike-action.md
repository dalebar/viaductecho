Stockport NHS Trust is urging patients to seek care in the best way possible amid upcoming strike action from resident doctors, starting at 7am on 17 December until 7am on 22 December, related to pay disputes. The Trust has assured the public that emergency services will stay operational, focusing on critical care like A&E, maternity, and ICUs. Patients should keep their scheduled appointments unless notified otherwise, but for non-urgent issues, they are encouraged to use NHS 111 online, their GP, or local urgent treatment centres. Some outpatient and surgical appointments may need to be rescheduled, but the Trust will contact affected patients directly.
