Andy Burnham's received a letter he sees as a game-changer for Greater Manchester's future. This week, he announced that the government has officially backed his ambitious plans to transform the city’s education system and boost development. His 'Greater Manchester Baccalaureate' (MBacc) aims to create a pathway for technical education directly linked to local industries, allowing teens to focus on the GCSEs and qualifications needed for high-demand jobs, bypassing university if they choose. 

Additionally, the new £1 billion 'Good Growth Fund' is set to kickstart development with 30 projects already approved, though concerns linger about oversight of public funds being channelled to private developers. Burnham emphasised the need for monitoring the fund's use at the recent Greater Manchester Combined Authority meeting. Overall, he believes these developments are crucial for Greater Manchester's progress over the next decade.
