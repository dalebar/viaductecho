Flooding near Manchester caused major disruptions on railway lines, particularly affecting services in the Macclesfield area. National Rail reported closures this morning (December 18), impacting Avanti West Coast routes between London Euston and Manchester Piccadilly, as well as Northern and CrossCountry services. Although lines have now reopened, delays and cancellations remain in effect. Passengers on certain routes, including a CrossCountry service to Bristol Temple Meads, experienced cancellations but can use their tickets on alternative services at no extra cost. Heavy rain is expected across the UK further into the day, adding to the weather woes. Disruption was expected to continue until 11:00, but it looks like it's cleared now, and National Rail is providing updates as the situation unfolds.
