Today in Stockport, expect a wet start with rain in the morning, clearing to partly cloudy skies by the afternoon. Temperatures will be a brisk 7°C rising to a cool 13°C. There’s a strong breeze at about 20 mph, making it feel chillier, and a 100% chance of rain this morning. Commuters should brace for potential delays due to wet roads, so it’s wise to pack an umbrella or waterproof gear. Dress in layers to stay comfy throughout the day, and keep sunglasses handy for the sun that might pop out later. Best to schedule any outdoor plans for after the morning showers!
