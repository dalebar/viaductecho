Exciting plans are afoot to revive a disused railway line in Denton for new tram-trains connecting Stockport, Tameside, and Manchester. Currently, the line mainly sees a minimal service with trains running only on Saturdays. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) wants to leverage tram-train technology to integrate this line into the wider Metrolink network, potentially linking it to Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Airport. Mayor Andy Burnham highlighted the goal of improving transport links for Denton, while MP Andrew Gwynne expressed optimism about the plans benefiting local residents and supporting regional growth. TfGM is collaborating with Stockport council to develop a business case for extending Metrolink from East Didsbury to Stockport, with tram-trains through Denton being a key component. The project aligns with the broader 2040 vision to enhance connectivity across Greater Manchester, with significant funding already secured. Stockport's council leader emphasised the importance of not letting the area be a final stop in transport development. Overall, if these plans come to fruition, it could greatly enhance transport options for thousands of residents.
