Stockport Council has unveiled ambitious plans to revamp Mersey Square, aiming to create a lively public space. The upgraded area will feature a play zone, new greenery, cycle paths, and improved walkways to encourage community engagement both day and night. A significant change will see the iconic Bear Pit transformed into a play area while maintaining its heritage. Enhanced walking and cycling routes will connect the square to the Interchange and the town centre. Additionally, seating, trees, and greenery will create a more inviting atmosphere. The project is funded by earmarked money from Transport for Greater Manchester and United Utilities. Cllr Micheala Meikle highlighted the transformation as a moment of pride for Stockport, while Cllr Grace Baynham emphasised its ambition to make the area greener and safer for everyone—residents, businesses, and visitors alike. This upgrade aims to complement existing infrastructure, including the award-winning spiral ramp linking the town centre to the train station.
