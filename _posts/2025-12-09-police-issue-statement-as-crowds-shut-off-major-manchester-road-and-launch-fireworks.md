On December 9, Manchester's Wilmslow Road turned into a lively scene as crowds celebrated the first anniversary of the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. Festivities included waving flags and launching fireworks, causing traffic chaos along this major route, prompting Greater Manchester Police to advise people to steer clear of the area. With cheering crowds reminiscent of celebrations in Syrian cities like Damascus and Aleppo, people took to bus stop shelters to join in the jubilation. The police acknowledged the situation, stating they were working to minimise disruption while ensuring safety. Mohammed Zain Alfaisal, one of those celebrating, reflected on the significance of the day, sharing that it brought renewed hope after decades of oppression under the Assad regime.
