Claire Sweeney attended the funeral of her late ex-boyfriend, boxer Ricky Hatton, who tragically passed away at 46 on September 14. The service, held at Manchester Cathedral, drew a host of celebrities and sports stars, including Tyson Fury and Liam Gallagher, while thousands of fans gathered to pay their respects. Claire, who dated Ricky for eight months after working together on Dancing On Ice, expressed her grief on social media, paying tribute to Ricky and sending sympathy to his family. Ahead of Ricky's 47th birthday, she shared a heartfelt post remembering him. Their romance, which included outings in pubs and holidays, ended just before Christmas, but Claire confirmed they remained friends after their split. Following the service, Ricky's cort√®ge made its way through Manchester, stopping at significant locations from his life, before heading to the Etihad Stadium for a final farewell.
