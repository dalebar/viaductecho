Colin McDonald, England's oldest living international footballer, has passed away at 95. The Bury-born goalkeeper, who was celebrated for his time at Burnley, played all four matches for England in the 1958 World Cup, including the first goalless draw against Brazil. He was Burnley’s goalkeeper from 1951 to 1961, appearing 186 times after signing as an amateur in 1948. His international career included eight caps, beginning with a friendly against the Soviet Union. Sadly, injuries, including a broken leg, led to early retirement in 1961. After a brief stint as a manager at Wycombe Wanderers, McDonald excelled as a scout, discovering talents like Colin Bell and Terry McDermott, and later worked at Oldham Athletic. Burnley FC expressed their sadness over his passing, extending thoughts to his family and friends.
