Greater Manchester is in for a soggy weekend as the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for heavy rain. The warning, valid from 9am Saturday to 6am Sunday, highlights potential transport disruptions and flooding risks. Heavy showers have already hit on Saturday, with more downpours expected throughout the day and into the early hours of Sunday. Rainfall totals could hit 20-30 mm widely, and even 60-80 mm in certain areas. Strong northwesterly winds may also develop as the rain gradually clears. While currently there are no flood warnings, there's a slight chance of flooding impacting homes and businesses, along with possible delays to bus and train services. Saturdayâ€™s temperature peaks at about 16C, with ongoing rain, but Sunday should bring drier conditions with highs around 15C. Stay safe out there, and keep an eye on your local updates!
