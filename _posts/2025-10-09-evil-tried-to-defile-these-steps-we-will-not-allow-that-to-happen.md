A week after the Yom Kippur terrorist attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, Rabbi Daniel Walker led a poignant vigil at the synagogue, attended by around 200 people. Rabbi Walker, hailed a hero for stopping the assailant, urged the community to enhance the holiness of the world amid sorrow. The gathering included prayers, singing, and a moment of silence to remember the victims, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, who died in the attack. Following the tragedy, faith leaders, including the Archbishop of York, condemned rising hate and called for unity across communities. A day of reflection has been encouraged throughout the UK to foster solidarity with the Jewish community, with people invited to light candles and share messages online using the hashtag #britainstandstogether. The terrorist, Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police during the attack, which highlighted escalating fears related to antisemitism and hate in society.
