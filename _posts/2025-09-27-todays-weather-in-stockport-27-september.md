Stockport's weather today is looking cloudy and cool. Expect a high of 14°C and a low of 9°C, with humidity around 78%, making it feel a bit damp. Rain is likely to kick in during the late afternoon, with a 90% chance, starting as light drizzle before getting heavier in the evening. Winds will be breezy, hitting around 22mph, so it's a bit nippy out there! 

If you're commuting, keep in mind potential delays this afternoon as the rain sets in. Make sure your wipers are up to scratch and consider leaving a bit earlier to dodge any splashy road conditions. For outdoor plans, dress in layers and don’t forget your waterproof jacket and umbrella. You might prefer to stay indoors later on to avoid the wet weather!
