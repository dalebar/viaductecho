It's a chilly start to 2026 for Greater Manchester as a cold snap is on the way this weekend, with the Met Office issuing yellow warnings for snow and ice. These warnings are effective from midnight tonight until midday tomorrow, particularly affecting southern areas like Trafford, South Manchester, and Stockport, as well as parts of Cheshire and other regions. Expect sleet and snow, with 1-5 cm possible, especially in higher grounds. New Year’s Day will be cold but bright, perfect for a brisk winter walk, with highs of just 6C. Friday starts chilly at 0C and only warms to about 3C, while Saturday sees temperatures drop to -2C, feeling colder. Sunday isn’t much better, with highs of just 2C but feeling like -2C. It looks like more clear and frosty days ahead, with no end to the cold snap in sight. Stay warm, folks!
