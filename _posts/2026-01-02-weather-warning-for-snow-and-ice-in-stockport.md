The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice in Stockport and Greater Manchester, effective from 00:01 on Friday, 2 January until 12 noon. This warning also covers London, the Midlands, and north Wales, and warns of potential travel disruptions. Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly indicated that we're in for a cold snap, with Arctic air bringing temperatures well below average, snow showers, and possible accumulations, especially in northern and central regions. Weekend temperatures could dip into minus double figures at night, with many areas struggling to reach above 0°C during the day. The cold spell may stick around into next week, so it’s essential to stay updated on forecasts and plan your journeys accordingly. Stay warm and safe, folks!
