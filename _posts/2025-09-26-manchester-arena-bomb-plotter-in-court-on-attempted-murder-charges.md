Hashem Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomb plotter, appeared in court via video link from HMP Belmarsh, facing charges for attempting to murder three prison officers at HMP Frankland in County Durham. The incident, which occurred on April 12, involved an ambush that left four officers injured after attacks with hot oil and makeshift weapons. Abedi, who has prior convictions related to the 2017 bombing that killed 22 people, is charged with three counts of attempted murder, as well as assault occasioning actual bodily harm and unauthorised possession of a knife. He didn't enter pleas during the court appearance and is set to return to the Old Bailey on October 17. The incident was described by the Prison Officers Association as a brutal and unprovoked attack, resulting in serious injuries for the officers involved.
