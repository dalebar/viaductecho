The old Ups N Downs pub site at 1 Wellington Road South is up for grabs at £700,000 and has planning permission to be transformed into 14 luxury flats plus a ground-floor commercial space. The proposed layout includes five one-bedroom and nine two-bedroom apartments. Although plans were approved in 2024, the conversion hasn’t happened yet, with the building being dubbed a "derelict eyesore." 

Dating back 200 years, the pub has had a rich history, originally known as the Wellington Bridge Inn before becoming Ups N Downs in the 1970s. It was quite the lively spot back in the day, described fondly by a blogger as a "rollercoaster" of a venue. The sale offers a chance to revive the site and give it a new lease of life.
