The former Ups N Downs pub on Wellington Road South is now up for grabs, with plans to convert it into 14 luxury apartments plus a ground floor shop or cafe. Marketed by MBRE for £700,000, the development would include five one-bed and nine two-bed flats. Although permission was granted in 2024, renovations haven’t started yet, with the site labelled a "derelict eyesore." The building has a rich 200-year history, originally known as the Wellington Bridge Inn and later as The Wellington Inn. It gained popularity in the '70s as a bustling pub, dubbed by a blogger as a "rollercoaster ride" of nightlife.
