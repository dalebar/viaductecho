Stockport Council is looking to shake things up for student transport, especially for those with special educational needs (SEND), due to rising costs and fewer contractors. Their current SEND transport expenses are forecasted to soar from £2.6m in 2020 to a staggering £9.1m by 2026, while post-16 transport alone could hit £2-3m this year. The council is considering two proposals for the upcoming academic year starting September 2026. 

The first aims to revise the Post-16 Transport Policy, encouraging the use of existing transport options like those through the Bee network. If not feasible, they'll offer Independent Travel Training or a personal budget based on distance to school. 

The second proposal focuses on renegotiating contracts with private firms to ensure better value, although this could lead to higher costs for families. Families in tough situations may receive support, while there's a mechanism for them to appeal decisions if needed. Either option could save over £250,000 and won’t affect transport for primary and secondary SEND students. The council’s final decision is expected soon.
