A graphic image shows the suspect in a terror attack outside the Heaton Park synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester, where he was shot dead by police. The photo depicts a knife and what appeared to be an explosive device, later confirmed to be non-viable. The incident occurred during Yom Kippur, resulting in two fatalities and four serious injuries after the suspect drove a car at the public and then stabbed individuals. Police acted swiftly, shooting the suspect within seven minutes of the first emergency call. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Stephen Watson praised the bravery of security staff and worshippers for preventing the attacker from entering the synagogue, where many were present. The investigation is being led by Counter Terrorism Policing, and two additional suspects have been arrested. In response to the attack, security measures across the city have been increased, and a cordon remains in place near the synagogue.
