Two Labour councillors from Stockport, Joe and Rosemary Barratt, have resigned from the party, criticising Keir Starmer's leadership for leading Labour towards a potential majority Reform government. Joe, who served as deputy leader, expressed deep disillusionment after over 15 years in Labour, citing a lack of vision and conviction for change. The duo has formed a new group called the Bredbury and Woodley Independents and may run a candidate in upcoming council elections against Labour and the Lib Dems.

Joe accused Starmer of squandering the party's previous majority and turning it into a group of indecisive middle-managers. He believes Labour must look to effective local leaders, like Andy Burnham, to reconnect with constituents and rejuvenate trust in politics. Meanwhile, Stockport Labour is seeking a new deputy following this loss, as the local party confronts a shifting political landscape. The council, currently under Lib Dem control, is facing potential fragmentation with the rise of independent groups ahead of the May 2026 elections.
