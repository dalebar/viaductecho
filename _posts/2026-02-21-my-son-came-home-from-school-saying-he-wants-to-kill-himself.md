A mum from Stockport has expressed her deep concerns over her seven-year-old son’s struggles with ADHD, highlighting the lack of adequate support for kids with special educational needs. At a local event, she revealed her son feels so overwhelmed that he’s mentioned wanting to harm himself, reflecting his stress over feeling isolated at school. The boy thrives at home but struggles in his mainstream setting, where he needs a trusted adult for emotional support.

Another couple, who recently moved from the US, shared their frustration about their daughter Keira’s complex needs and the difficulty in securing her a school place since September. Eventually, they found a suitable SEND school, illustrating the systemic challenges many families face. The Lib Dems have called for the SEND system to be prioritised like essential infrastructure, arguing that the current model is failing children and is being exploited for profit. Local MP Tom Morrison echoed this sentiment, stressing the urgent need for reform to support children effectively.
