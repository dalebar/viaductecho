North Manchester's redevelopment project is making strides as families prepare to move into the first new council homes in Collyhurst Village. This initial phase includes 10 houses for social rent, part of a larger plan to build 274 new homes, with 130 designated for social rent. Existing residents are being prioritised, and some have already received keys. This development is a key part of the Victoria North regeneration programme aimed at adding up to 15,000 homes in the area over the next 15 years, alongside improved green spaces and transport links. 

So far, 430 homes have been completed, with more in progress and planned. The council is committed to continued community engagement to guide the long-term vision, focusing on affordable and sustainable housing for all stages of life, and enhancing local amenities. Councillor Bev Craig emphasised that this investment is a significant step for Collyhurst and the wider north Manchester area, promising a Â£6 billion boost for health, housing, and job opportunities in the coming years.
