Firswood and Whalley Range experienced a whopping £61,000 jump in house prices in 2025, pushing the average home price in the M16 postcode to over £333,000 – a 23% rise from the previous year. This makes it the third largest increase in the UK. Firswood’s surge is partly due to buyers moving from pricier neighbouring areas like Chorlton, where homes now cost nearly £424,000. Other notable postcode rises include OL1 in Oldham, with an 18% increase to £203,000, and M6, up 15%. M9, covering Harpurhey and Blackley, followed with a 10% rise, while M35 and M12 saw 9% increases each. However, it’s not all rosy – the M1 postcode in Manchester city centre saw a 20% price drop, with homes averaging £253,000. M15 also saw a decline of 15% in prices. Interestingly, one of London’s most expensive areas, SW1X, faced a staggering 51% drop, bringing average prices down to £2.7 million.
