A 44-year-old man from Goole was arrested in Manchester after police intercepted a massive cocaine haul worth over £53 million at the London Gateway port. The operation uncovered around 536 kilos of the drug, leading to his arrest and charges of conspiracy to import Class A drugs. He’s also facing charges for a separate cannabis importation incident involving 872 kilos back in November 2025. After appearing at Leeds Magistrates' Court, he's been remanded to Leeds Crown Court for a hearing in March. The operation was a collaboration between the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit and the UK Border Force, which aimed to disrupt the flow of harmful drugs into the region.
