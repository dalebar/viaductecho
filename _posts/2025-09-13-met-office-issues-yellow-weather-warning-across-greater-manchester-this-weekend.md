This weekend, Greater Manchester is bracing for a yellow weather warning from the Met Office due to strong winds and heavy rain following a week of storms. The warning, which now covers much of England and Wales, heralds the potential arrival of Storm Amy. Coastal areas could see winds of 60-70mph on Sunday evening, with gusts hitting 45-55mph inland on Monday morning. This weather could cause travel disruptions and possible power outages, so everyoneâ€™s advised to plan their journeys carefully, check transport schedules, and drive cautiously. The Met Office recommends preparing for power cuts by having torches and batteries ready. Stay safe out there, folks!
