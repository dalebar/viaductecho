Last weekend, Greater Manchester Police dispersed around 70 vehicles during a crackdown on planned car cruise meets after a tragic accident in Bolton that killed four people. A dispersal order was put in place across the region from January 17, allowing officers to remove anyone suspected of anti-social behaviour. This order was enforced following concerns about safety at car meets, which can attract large crowds and lead to risky behaviour. During the operation, several warnings were issued to drivers, and traffic offence reports were handed out for various motoring issues. The police aim to prevent harm and maintain order in local communities, with a promise to increase their presence to enforce these rules. Community leaders urged attendees at such events to think about the potential risks and to follow police guidance for everyone’s safety.
