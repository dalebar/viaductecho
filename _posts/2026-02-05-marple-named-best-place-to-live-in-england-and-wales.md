Marple has been crowned the best place to live in England and Wales for 2026, according to property agency Garrington. The town is praised for its charm, community spirit, and proximity to Manchester, sitting near the scenic Peak District. Stockport also shines in the rankings, with Bramhall (4th), Reddish (11th), and Stockport itself (15th) making the cut. Factors like green space, air quality, and schools were considered in the rankings. Bramhall's vibrant high street and strong transport links make it a hit with professionals too. Garrington highlights that their list celebrates quality living locations rather than ranking places as 'best' or 'worst'.
