Stockport's weekend weather is set to be a bit of a mixed bag. On Friday, expect clouds and rain, with temps between 3°C and 7°C and brisk winds up to 23 mph, so it might be a day to stay indoors. Saturday will offer some relief with warmer temps peaking at 9°C, partly cloudy skies, and just the occasional shower, especially better in the morning. Rain chances will drop later in the day, with winds easing a bit to around 19 mph. Sunday will be a chillier affair, sticking around 7°C and feeling cool with high humidity, but it’s the calmest day wind-wise at just 6 mph and less rain expected (42% chance). For those commuting, Friday's wet weather means extra caution is needed, and if you're heading out this weekend, Saturday’s your best bet for outdoor fun—just keep an eye on the showers! Always good to have a backup plan for indoor activities. Cheers!
