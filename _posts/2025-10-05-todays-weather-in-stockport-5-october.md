Stockport’s weather on Sunday is a bit of a mixed bag. Expect early morning rain, so it's a good idea to grab your umbrella. The day will be partly cloudy with temperatures peaking at 14°C and dropping to around 11°C, while humidity sits at 71%. Winds will be quite fierce at up to 39mph, making it feel cooler, so layer up to stay comfy. 

For commuters, be cautious on the roads as the rain could lead to slippery conditions, and check public transport schedules for potential delays. Overall, dress for rain and wind, and be ready to adjust your plans if the weather turns.
