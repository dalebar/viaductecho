A taxi and a tram collided in Manchester city centre on Mosley Street this morning, causing major rush hour disruptions. The Metrolink tram hit the front side of a silver hackney carriage. It's unclear if anyone was hurt. Firefighters and police responded, blocking tracks between St Peter's Square and Piccadilly Gardens, affecting tram services across multiple lines including Altrincham, Ashton, Bury, Eccles, and MediaCity. Trams resumed around 7:50 am, but delays continued as services gradually recovered. The Bee Network thanked passengers for their patience. For updates, check the Manchester Evening News.
