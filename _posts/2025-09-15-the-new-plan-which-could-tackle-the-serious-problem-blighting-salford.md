Councillors Paul Heilbron and Jonathan Moore are pushing for a plan to deal with off-road vehicles causing chaos in Salford. They’ll be addressing the issue at a meeting on September 17 at Salford Civic Centre, aiming for a coordinated response involving the council, Greater Manchester Police, and local housing providers. Residents are feeling frustrated as enforcement hasn't kept up with the problems, especially in places like Clifton Country Park and Salford Quays.

The councillors are proposing measures like installing bollards and fencing, using CCTV, and creating Public Spaces Protection Orders. They also want to enhance reporting systems for anti-social behaviour linked to vehicles. GMP is already on the case, having launched an operation in summer 2024 that’s led to arrests and bike seizures. They’re urging the community to report any reckless riding online or by calling 101. The meeting will be a chance for Salford councillors to vote on these proposed actions to reclaim the streets for residents.
