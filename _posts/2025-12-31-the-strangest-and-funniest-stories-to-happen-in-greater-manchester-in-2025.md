This year in Greater Manchester has been a wild mix of quirky stories and hilarious antics. From a massive Liam Gallagher lasagna to a pug resembling Richard Madeley, there’s been no shortage of oddities. One standout moment saw a woman practising yoga on a flooded Manchester Airport relief road, while window cleaners sparked a surge of women throwing mud at their windows. The comedic heights continued with the circus clown Bippo relating tales of confused fans dropped off at the wrong venue—definitely not Old Trafford! 

Oasis brought back the nostalgic vibe with five nights of concerts at Heaton Park, while a Richard Madeley lookalike contest turned into a community spectacle. Locals even crowned a pug the winner! In Bolton, an Elvis impersonator shared what it’s like to perform tribute acts. 

The fascination with local legends continued, with the unveiling of an armadillo mural to support a campaign aided by drag queens. This year’s stories paint a picture of a lively and community-focused Manchester, where laughter and a bit of cheekiness reign supreme!
