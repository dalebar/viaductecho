Jo Worrall, a retired school business manager from Stockport, is gearing up for an epic adventure by sailing 40,000 miles around the world in the 2025 Clipper Race. This annual event is designed for those with little sailing experience, offering training to prepare participants for the challenges ahead. Jo joined the Yacht Club Punta del Este team, led by professional sailors David Sautret and Lorraine O'Hanlon. The journey, which began from Portsmouth, will last about 11 months, taking them through six oceans and various extreme weather conditions. Jo, who decided to pursue this adventure following her divorce, expressed her excitement and the personal significance of this journey. The race features participants from 40 countries and aims to make sailing more accessible. They will visit destinations including Cape Town, Australia, and even Seattle on their way back to Portsmouth. The Clipper Race, founded by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, encourages people from different backgrounds to embrace sailing.
