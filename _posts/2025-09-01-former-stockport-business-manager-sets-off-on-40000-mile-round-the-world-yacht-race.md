Jo Worrall, a retired school business manager from Stockport, is setting sail on a remarkable adventure, participating in the 2025 Clipper Race. This annual event encourages those with little sailing experience to embark on a 40,000-mile journey around the world, and Jo is ready to tackle the challenge. After a divorce and a desire for change, she sold her house to take part in this race, which launches from Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth, and lasts about 11 months. Sheâ€™s joining the Yacht Club Punta del Este team, led by experienced sailors, and will navigate through six oceans, facing all sorts of extreme weather conditions while living in close quarters aboard a yacht. With stops in various global locations, including South Africa and China, Jo is eager to turn this adventure into a personal journey of self-discovery. The Clipper Race, founded by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, aims to remove barriers to sailing, welcoming participants from diverse backgrounds.
