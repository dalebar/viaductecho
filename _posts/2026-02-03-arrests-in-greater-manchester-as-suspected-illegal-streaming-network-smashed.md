Police have dismantled a suspected illegal TV streaming network in Greater Manchester, making four arrests, including two women and two men linked to the Bolton and Blackpool areas. One suspect is thought to have raked in over £3 million from this operation. Officers seized 10 servers and related equipment valued at over £750,000 during raids. The arrests were made as part of an investigation triggered by reports of suspicious activity connected to a large-scale illicit streaming service. All four individuals are being investigated for copyright infringement and money laundering. Detective Constable Jordan Day emphasised the operation's significance in tackling organised crime in IPTV services, which can expose consumers to security risks like malware. Matt Hibbert from Sky thanked the police for their actions and highlighted the importance of protecting legitimate content in the face of increasing piracy. The servers were shut down on-site, effectively halting the illegal streaming operations across the UK.
