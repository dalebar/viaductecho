Stockport Council is set to take down some flags from lampposts to make way for Christmas lights, but others can stay up as long as they're safe and donâ€™t have slogans. Cllr Mark Roberts reassured that the national flag will continue to fly at the Town Hall. The Christmas lights will be switched on from 14th November, and flags on lampposts where lights are going up will be removed for safety reasons. Residents are encouraged to display flags at home instead, as removing them from lampposts can be costly for the council. If flags get damaged or worn, they might need to be taken down in the future. Repairs to road markings or roundabouts will be handled quickly, given their importance for safety. The council is also investigating any incidents of vandalism, as repair costs are becoming a concern with tight budgets.
