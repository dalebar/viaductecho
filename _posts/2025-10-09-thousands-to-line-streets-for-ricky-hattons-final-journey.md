Ricky Hatton's funeral is set for tomorrow, October 10, with thousands of fans expected to pay their respects in Manchester. The procession will start at The Cheshire Cheese pub in Gee Cross around 9:45 AM and travel over 15 miles through key locations in Ricky's life, including his childhood pub and gym. It will pause for a dove release at the site of his parents' former pub and pass through Hyde town centre, where a book of condolence was opened. The route includes stops at Betta Bodies gym and the AO Arena, where Ricky had some legendary fights. The service at Manchester Cathedral begins at noon, and entry is by invite only. After the service, the cort√®ge will take one final trip to the Etihad Stadium for fans to say goodbye before heading to a private committal. Following his death, there's a campaign to support men's mental health through charities close to Ricky's heart, including the newly established Ricky Hatton Foundation, which aims to help those battling mental illness.
