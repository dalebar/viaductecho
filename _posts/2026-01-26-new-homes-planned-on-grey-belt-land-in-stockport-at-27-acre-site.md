Stockport has plans for a new housing development on a 27-acre site on Jacksons Lane, proposing up to 160 new homes, including affordable options. The site, opposite Hazel Grove High School, is currently agricultural land and residents are raising concerns about the potential loss of green space. House builder Taylor Wimpey argues the area shouldn't be considered green belt as it doesn’t contribute to the countryside's open nature. The local plan aims for at least 440 new homes at this location by 2042, and feedback from a recent consultation is under council review. A separate application by Bellway Homes proposes 176 homes on a nearby 19-acre site. Some locals, like Erika Morgan and Adele Shaw, are worried about the negative impact on traffic and community space, stressing the area's importance for families and wildlife. The council has until April 17, 2026, to make a decision on Taylor Wimpey’s application.
