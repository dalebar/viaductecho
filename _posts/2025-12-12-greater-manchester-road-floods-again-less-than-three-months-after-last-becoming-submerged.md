Flixton Road in Urmston, Trafford, has flooded again just a few months after a similar incident in September caused by a burst pipe. Recent images show water flooding near homes, prompting police and fire crews to close nearby footpaths. Residents, frustrated by the recurring issue, have taken to social media to voice their concerns about water pressure and the state of the drains. United Utilities confirmed the current flooding is again due to a burst pipe and has dispatched engineers to investigate and resolve the issue. They acknowledged the disruption caused to local water services and thanked residents for their patience. Trafford Council has been contacted for comments on the situation.
