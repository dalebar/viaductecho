Wigan town centre is set to see a dispersal order for the third time in under two weeks due to rising anti-social behaviour. The latest order, issued by Greater Manchester Police (GMP), will be in effect from 3pm on Friday until 3pm on Sunday, September 21. GMP highlighted an increase in reported incidents involving groups causing harassment to residents and local businesses. This order empowers officers to remove anyone likely to cause distress from the area. Neighbourhood Inspector Lisa Morris stated that the aim is to ensure the town centre remains safe and welcoming for law-abiding visitors. There will also be a heightened police presence to reinforce this initiative. If youâ€™ve any questions, officers are there to help!
