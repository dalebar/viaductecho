The A627M motorway in Rochdale was closed tonight due to a police incident, causing traffic to back up. National Highway North West announced the closure, advising drivers to use local roads instead. The southbound lane between A664 and J3 M62 was affected, with Inrix reporting all traffic was temporarily held. The road reopened around 8pm, but there were still delays of about 10 minutes in the area. All lanes are now clear, following the resolution of the incident.
