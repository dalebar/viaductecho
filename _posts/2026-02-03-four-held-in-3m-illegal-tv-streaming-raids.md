Four individuals have been arrested in an operation targeting an illegal TV streaming network estimated to be worth millions. The raids, spanning Greater Manchester and Lancashire, uncovered £750,000 worth of advanced equipment, including ten servers. Among those arrested are a 40-year-old man from Blackpool, a 49-year-old man from Bolton, and two women, aged 40 and 21, also from Bolton, all suspected of conspiracy to infringe copyright and money laundering. One suspect reportedly generated over £3m in revenue. The investigation, sparked by Sky's report of suspicious activity, aims to combat organised crime profiting from piracy. Authorities have shut down the servers, with those arrested released under investigation. Det Con Jordan Day emphasised the threat posed by such criminal operations to broadcasting integrity, while Sky’s anti-piracy director pledged to continue efforts to disrupt these networks.
