A post on social media claimed that Matt Goodwin, standing for Reform UK in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election, said he 'hated' his time in Manchester and called locals 'all chavs.' This quote, supposedly taken from a Telegraph interview, was shared by his opponent, Nick Buckley of Advance UK. However, fact-checking revealed that the supposed quote isn’t found in the actual article, nor anywhere else online. A reverse image search showed that while the image of Goodwin was from a genuine interview, the quote was likely fabricated. Buckley admitted he had seen the post multiple times, leading him to believe it was real, but stated that he would remove it if proven false, stressing the importance of verifying information during the fast-paced election period. The Manchester Evening News reached out to Reform UK for a statement.
