Asif Vali, Amir Khan's ex-manager, has been found guilty of sexually abusing a woman, despite his denials. The conviction came after a three-day trial at Bolton Crown Court. The court heard allegations including inappropriate text messages and sexual acts performed in front of the victim. Prosecutor Huw Edwards revealed that Vali had begun to show sexual interest in the woman as early as 2012, escalating to inappropriate touching and behaviour that frightened her. The specific incident involved Vali assaulting her, leading to her reporting the offences only in 2019, after confiding in close contacts over the years. He was convicted on charges of exposure, sexual assault, and assault by penetration and is set to learn his sentencing in February.
