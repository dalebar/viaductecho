The refurbishment of Manchester Town Hall is facing major delays and cost overruns, with an additional £95m now needed, raising the total cost to £525m. Work is expected to extend until spring 2027, an extra six months later than planned. Councillor Richard Kilpatrick expressed frustration over the project management, emphasising the jump from an estimated £305m to £500m as “a disaster.” This request for additional funds marks the second time in 15 months that the council has been asked for more cash, following a £76m increase last year. Coun Garry Bridges acknowledged that numerous external factors, like the pandemic and war in Europe, have contributed to the rising costs, while other councillors highlighted the historical significance and safety issues that necessitated such extensive work. Project director Paul Candelent noted the lack of benchmark data for this type of restoration, complicating cost predictions. The council is set to approve the additional funding on December 10.
