Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber and current Green Party leader on Trafford Council, is set to represent the Greens in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election on 26 February. This election follows the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne for health reasons. Spencer aims to unite the community, contrasting her message of "Hope v hate" against the divisive candidacy of Reform UK's Matt Goodwin, who has connections to far-right activists. 

Labour, which previously held the seat with a significant majority, has yet to choose its candidate after blocking popular mayor Andy Burnham from entering. The party's decline nationally poses a challenge in the by-election. Spencer emphasised her strong local ties, asserting her understanding of constituents' needs and issues. Reform UK's Goodwin claims to be an outsider, positioning the election as a referendum on Labour leader Keir Starmer. As the political landscape heats up, this by-election is shaping up to be a pivotal moment for the parties involved.
