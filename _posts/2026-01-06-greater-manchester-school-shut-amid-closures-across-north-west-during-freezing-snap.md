Hollingworth Academy in Milnrow has had to close today due to heating issues caused by a burst pipe, with temperatures hitting sub-zero overnight. The school hopes to reopen tomorrow and is working hard to resolve the problem. This closure follows the earlier shutdown of St Thomas' CE Junior and Infant School in Golborne, which has since reopened. Other schools across the North West, including several in Lancashire and Cheshire, are also closed due to similar heating problems amid a Met Office yellow weather warning for snow and ice. The warning remains in place until 11am, cautioning that scattered wintry showers and icy patches might disrupt travel this morning. The Met Office predicts some areas may see small snow accumulations, particularly in higher grounds, while other regions might experience negligible amounts.
