Four people were injured in a serious incident outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in north Manchester this morning. A security guard was stabbed, and others sustained injuries from a car driven at them. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) were alerted around 9:31 AM and declared the situation a major incident just minutes later. Officers fired shots, hitting the suspected offender shortly after. Paramedics arrived swiftly to treat the injured while the area was sealed off. Mayor Andy Burnham reassured the public that while it was a major incident, the immediate danger seemed contained, thanks to GMP’s quick response and support from on-site security and the community. Residents are advised to avoid the area as emergency services continue to manage the situation.
