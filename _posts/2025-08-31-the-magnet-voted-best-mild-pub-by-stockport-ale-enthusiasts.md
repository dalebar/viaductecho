The Magnet Pub in Heaton Norris has been crowned 'best mild pub' by locals during this year’s Mild Magic Ale Trail, a popular event organised by CAMRA. The pub impressed with a rotating selection of nine milds. This year’s trail saw around 5,500 visits, with 260 participants tackling various challenges—an increase of 25% from last year. Four enthusiasts even managed to visit all 101 participating pubs!

Voters picked Blackjack Dark Ruby as the best mild, available at several locations. Outgoing organiser Darren Berry thanked the pubs and breweries for promoting this unique ale style and remarked on the growing interest in milds, especially after Penzance Mild was named Champion Beer of Britain. Excitingly, another Mild Magic trail is planned for Spring 2026, so keep an eye out for participating pubs!
