In the early '90s, an iconic image of Manchester gang culture appeared in a national newspaper, showcasing a drug dealer in a balaclava claiming, "gun law is running Manchester." By 2007, the city faced a surge of gun violence, stirring up a reputation as "Gunchester." However, the situation improved significantly by 2013, thanks to police efforts like Operation Xcalibre, which targeted gun crime. Despite a spike in 2018, the latest figures show a substantial drop in shootings—52%—from 2021 to 2025. This decline is attributed to firearms recovery operations and community engagement, with initiatives like Operation Aztec helping to recover 168 firearms. Recent years saw increased arrests and hefty sentences for serious offences, contributing to a further decline in incidents. Det Supt Joe Harrop highlighted the importance of public cooperation in surrendering unwanted firearms, stressing that each recovered weapon potentially saves lives. While progress is evident, challenges remain, especially with the circulation of guns among gangs. The ongoing crime-fighting efforts aim to ensure that Greater Manchester remains a safer, more peaceful place for its residents.
