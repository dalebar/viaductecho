Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is optimistic that a new agreement on the Hillsborough Law will be reached in a matter of days. An amendment meant for Parliament on January 19 was withdrawn after significant backlash over its inclusion of security services, which critics worry would dilute the bill's intent. Both Burnham and Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram argue that this amendment creates an excessive opt-out for intelligence officials regarding evidence disclosure after major incidents. Burnham insists that the bill should prioritise transparency in the wake of disasters, asserting that it is crucial for both truth and security improvements. He believes that the current pause isn’t a setback, saying that a solid cross-party agreement is needed before it returns to Parliament, hopefully within a week. Burnham pointed out the importance of getting this right while honouring victims, like Olivia Campbell-Hardy from the Manchester Arena bombing.
