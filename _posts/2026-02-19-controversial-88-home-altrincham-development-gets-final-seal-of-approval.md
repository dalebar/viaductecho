A contentious plan for 88 new homes in Altrincham has officially received the green light. Developer L&Q will replace six 1960s apartment blocks on New Street with 64 apartments and 24 houses in the Downs Conservation Area, including 35 affordable homes. The planning committee approved the project last summer, despite local residents expressing concerns about potential parking chaos, claiming the area lacks sufficient spaces for the increase in residents. Opponents noted that the 35 parking spaces planned for the development wouldn't accommodate the demands. However, Trafford's projects manager reassured that new residents won't be eligible for parking permits and highlighted alternative parking options nearby. Additionally, as part of the deal, L&Q will contribute over £137,000 for secondary school places and support measures for traffic regulation to help manage parking in the area.
