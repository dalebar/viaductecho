Itâ€™s Saturday in Reddish, and locals are still frustrated over the lack of transport at Reddish South station, which offers just one train a week to Stalybridge and back. With nearby stations requiring lengthy walks, residents are calling for better rail services, particularly a direct link to Manchester Victoria or Stockport. The Friends of Reddish South group has been campaigning for improved services, highlighting the need for connection in this growing area. Locals believe added train options would ease congestion and benefit those commuting to Manchester. Stockport officials support these calls, with plans for a Metrolink stop seen as a potential solution. However, transport bosses note that complications around rail capacity and coordination among multiple agencies make immediate changes challenging. While discussions are underway, the community remains hopeful for better rail access to support their daily lives and reduce reliance on cars.
