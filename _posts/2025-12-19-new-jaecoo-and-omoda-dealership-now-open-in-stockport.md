A new Omoda and Jaecoo car dealership has opened in Stockport at 214 Wellington Road South, right next to the Swansway Honda dealership, which will continue operating. Managed by Swansway Motor Group, the dealership kicked off its customer service this month. Omoda and Jaecoo, both fresh faces in the UK market, have made a splash with over 42,000 registrations this year alone, surpassing established brands like Hyundai and Nissan. Their appeal lies in stylish designs, accessibility, and competitive pricing.

Currently, Omoda offers four models, starting with the Omoda 5 at £23,990 and including electric and hybrid options. Jaecoo has two main models, with prices starting at £24,505. Omoda targets a younger demographic, while Jaecoo aims for a slightly older, more luxury-focused audience. Exciting times ahead for car shoppers in Stockport!
