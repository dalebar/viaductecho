Manchester MP Lucy Powell is set to compete against Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson for the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party position. Powell secured 117 nominations, while Phillipson received 175, with backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy dropping out after failing to meet the 80-nomination threshold. The contest was sparked by the resignation of Angela Rayner following tax-related issues. Other candidates, including Dame Emily Thornberry and Alison McGovern, also fell short and exited the race before nominations closed.

The two candidates now need backing from 5% of constituency parties or three affiliates, including two trade unions. The voting period starts on October 8 and concludes on October 23, with results out on October 25. Powell expressed gratitude for the support received and emphasized unity and progressive change for the Labour Party. Meanwhile, Phillipson highlighted the importance of collaboration and focusing on future hopes over grievances. The upcoming election could overshadow Labour's conference in Liverpool, with both candidates steering clear of criticisms towards Sir Keir Starmer's leadership.
