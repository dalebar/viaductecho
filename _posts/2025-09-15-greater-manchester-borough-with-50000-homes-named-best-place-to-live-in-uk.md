Wigan has been named the UK's top place to live, scoring a perfect 100 in a study assessing quality of life across towns and cities. The research by Kaybridge Residential ranked locations based on cost of living, crime rates, air quality, and healthcare access. Wigan stood out for its affordability, with a low cost of living index and low crime rates compared to other areas, including pricey central London. Housing options are also accessible; for example, two-bedroom flats are going for around £50K. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham praised Wigan for its ongoing £250m transformation project that will create more homes and jobs. He highlighted improvements in transport connectivity with the upcoming Bee Network system. Overall, Wigan is seen as an excellent choice for families and professionals looking for quality living without a hefty price tag.
