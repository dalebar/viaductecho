A mother from Dukinfield, Tameside, is urging folks to donate blood after her teenage son was severely injured in an attack. Sarah never thought she’d need the NHS Blood and Transplant service until she received a devastating call about her 16-year-old. After 16 life-saving transfusions at Manchester Royal Infirmary, her son was stable enough for surgery. Sarah expressed her immense gratitude, stating those donors are "angels" to her. Even years later, the experience lingers strongly in her memory. She now regularly donates blood and encourages others to do the same, emphasising its importance for families in dire situations. Blood donation might seem daunting, but it's quick, simple, and could be a lifeline for anyone needing it—like newborns or cancer patients. Sarah passionately insists, "We owe it to those in need to ensure blood is available."
