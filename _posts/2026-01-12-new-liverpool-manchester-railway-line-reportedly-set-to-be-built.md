A new railway line between Manchester and Liverpool is set to kick off, boosting the north’s transport network. Supported by key figures like Andy Burnham and Bev Craig, this line is expected to connect Liverpool Central to a new underground station at Manchester Piccadilly, passing through Warrington Bank Quay and Manchester Airport. This initiative, part of a larger project to improve cross-Pennine connections, aims to tackle congestion on northern routes. While plans for this new line were revealed last May, officials haven’t confirmed when construction will start. If all goes well, it could lead to significant city centre development in Manchester, freeing up valuable land for housing and businesses. Burnham also has big dreams for underground Metrolink routes linked to the new Piccadilly station. Three potential routes have been discussed, aiming to enhance transport connections across the city. The overall aim is to improve infrastructure and accommodate future growth, with Burnham urging for early discussions on funding to get the ball rolling.
