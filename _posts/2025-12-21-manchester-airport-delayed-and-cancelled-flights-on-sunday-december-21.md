Manchester Airport is gearing up for its busiest festive season ever, expecting 1.5 million passengers from December 19 to January 4. With folks heading off for family visits, ski trips, or a bit of winter sun, it's key to stay updated on flight statuses due to potential last-minute changes driven by staffing, weather, or Air Traffic Control issues. The busiest day is set for December 28, with around 100,000 passengers, while Christmas Day will see close to 35,000 travellers, especially to Dubai. If flights get delayed or cancelled, airlines must offer support options like food, accommodation, and refunds. As of the latest update, there are no cancellations at Manchester Airport today, but several flights are delayed. Make sure to keep an eye on your travel plans!
