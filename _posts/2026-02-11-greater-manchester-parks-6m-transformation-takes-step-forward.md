Longford Park in Stretford is set for a £6m transformation, with the Casey Group freshly appointed to collaborate with Trafford Council over the next eight weeks. Plans include a new BMX track, revamped tennis, basketball, and football pitches, plus upgrades to the children's play area and café. They'll also improve Pets Corner and turn Long Barn into a hub for volunteers and training. The project aims to restore historic features at Longford Hall and alleviate flooding by opening up Longford Brook, with new paths, seating, and lighting in the works. Plus, 81 new trees and shrubs will enhance local wildlife. Trafford Council highlights the park as a cherished community spot that aligns with the revitalisation of Stretford town centre. Stephen Adshead from the Council expresses excitement about the improvements, which are supported by over £3m in National Lottery funding and additional contributions.
