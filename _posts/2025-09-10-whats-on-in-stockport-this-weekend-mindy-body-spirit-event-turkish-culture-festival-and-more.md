This weekend in Stockport, there’s a fab lineup of events sponsored by Worker Bee Markets and Waterside Hotel & Leisure Club. 

1. **Mind Body Spirit Event**: Happening at Stockport Masonic Guildhall on 6-7 September, from 10am-6pm. It promises a spiritual experience with healing therapies and a chance to connect with like-minded folks.

2. **Turkish Culture Festival**: At Merseyway Shopping Centre, also on 6-7 September, you can enjoy free entry to live music, dance performances, and tasty Turkish grub like baklava and gözleme.

3. **Ian F Ball In-Store Session**: Catch the guitarist at HMV Stockport on 6 September at 1pm, performing tracks from his new album along with other tunes – all for free!

4. **Quartet**: Running from 6-13 September at Chads Theatre, this charming comedy about aging opera singers mixes wit and poignancy beautifully.
