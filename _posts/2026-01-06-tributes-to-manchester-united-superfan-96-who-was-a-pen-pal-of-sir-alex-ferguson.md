Emily Ordish, a lifelong Manchester United fan and devoted supporter since 1938, recently passed away at 96. Born in Salford, she had a vibrant connection with the club, attending countless matches, including the memorable European Cup wins in 1968 and 1999. Emily formed a special bond with Sir Alex Ferguson through her letters, receiving regular responses and birthday cards over the years. Her family reflects on her being a brilliant mum and a passionate United supporter, with her enthusiasm for the club thriving among her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Clair Kearsley, her daughter, described Emily as the family's driving force, always making them feel loved and cared for despite their circumstances. Emily's love for United was so strong that she was cremated in her club shirt, with her memorabilia included in her coffin. The family plans to honour her legacy with many attendees wearing United shirts at her funeral, celebrating the profound impact she had on their lives and the club.
