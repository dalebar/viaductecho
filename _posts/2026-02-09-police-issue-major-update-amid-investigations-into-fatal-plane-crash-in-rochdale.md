Police are investigating a tragic plane crash near Littleborough, Rochdale, that happened on February 3, resulting in the deaths of two men. One victim, 36-year-old Arian Abbasi, was remembered as a devoted father and husband, just days away from becoming a commercial airline pilot. The light aircraft, a Cirrus SR20, crashed shortly after taking off from Birmingham, and inquiries are ongoing, including input from the Air Accident Investigation Branch. 

Among the investigation's focuses is a parachute that became stuck on a nearby pylon; police initially warned the public to avoid a risky part of the plane. Fortunately, the missing parachute part was discovered and reported by a member of the public on February 7. The aircraft was owned by Daedalus Aviation, a Birmingham-based company. Police are urging any witnesses to come forward, providing details through their contact channels.
