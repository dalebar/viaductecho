Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell has hinted that blocking Andy Burnham from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election wouldn't sit right, stressing that the decision should rest with local members. At the Fabian Society conference in London, she highlighted the significance of this by-election, calling it potentially the most consequential of the Parliament. While not advocating directly for Burnham's candidacy, she emphasised the need for 'the best possible candidate' to secure a win and avoid letting other parties, like the Greens, gain a foothold in the North.

Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has voiced his support for Burnham's return to Parliament, ready to campaign for him. With the deadline for candidacy application approaching, Labour MPs, including Angela Rayner, are rallying support for Burnham and urging party leadership against interference. There's rising concern that some on Labour's national executive committee might attempt to block his candidacy due to potential governmental instability. Overall, there's a strong call for local autonomy in candidate selection to strengthen Labour's position in the North.
