Matthew Gavan and Charlotte Busby, who got engaged at the Manchester Christmas Markets, are sending a massive thank you to the lovely folks who shared in their special moment. The couple travelled from Wrexham to Manchester on November 29, and after just four months of dating, Matthew proposed near the giant Santa outside Manchester Central Library. Charlotte described it as an emotional and perfect moment. Passers-by captured the proposal on camera and offered to send the photos and videos to the couple via AirDrop, making it even more memorable. Charlotte has been reliving the magic through those snapshots and can't wait to share the news on family WhatsApp groups. They left Manchester feeling over the moon and plan to make visiting the Christmas Markets an annual tradition. They’re grateful for the kindness shown by strangers, saying, “thank you so much!” to anyone who helped commemorate their engagement. What a lovely story to spread some festive joy!
