Football's popularity is soaring, especially in the Premier League and women's game, but Sunday leagues face tough times. Keith Coates, a lifelong member of the Stockport Sunday League, notes a decline from over 70 teams in the 60s and 70s to just 22 last season. Various factors contribute to this drop, like pub closures, cost-of-living pressures, changing work patterns, and more people lounging at home rather than kicking a ball about. Robert Sleigh from Higher Poynton highlights the rising costs of running a team — around £3,000 a season — as a key issue. However, there might be a glimmer of hope; Manchester FA reports an uptick in participation, with 5,000 men currently playing and a 10% increase in teams this season. Sunday league football fosters community spirit and friendships, making it vital despite its challenges. As Mark Wilson from Rochdalians puts it, it’s not just about the game; it’s about the social connections that come with it.
