The Poundland in Oldham town centre is set to close tomorrow, December 13, as part of a broader restructuring that’s leading to 100 to 150 store closures across the UK. Recently sold to Gordon Brothers for £1, the chain has been steadily shutting stores, with Oldham being one of 32 locations closing this winter. In preparation, affected shops are offering clearance sales, with prices slashed by up to 40%. While some locals feel sad and worried about what might replace it—voicing concerns over declining town centre vitality—others are taking a more light-hearted approach to losing the store. Despite the mixed feelings, many hope for a bright future for the staff affected by the closure. Ironically, this comes after a recent scare when Oldham's branch temporarily closed due to a landlord dispute.
