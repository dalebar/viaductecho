Romiley, a village in Greater Manchester, is facing a bit of a pickle over ongoing roadworks aimed at reducing traffic congestion and improving travel options. The council and Transport for Greater Manchester have started a £1.8 million project to install a two-way cycling track on Compstall Road and revamped crossings for pedestrians and cyclists. However, this has caused some disruption, with businesses like The Crafty Vendor and The Handyman expressing concerns over potential losses due to reduced foot traffic and closed bus stops, especially with Christmas shopping around the corner.

While some locals fear the construction will hurt businesses more than it helps, others are more optimistic, welcoming the idea of getting cars off busy roads. Stockport council, though, insists these improvements will enhance accessibility for walking and cycling, supporting local traders in the long run. They're working to ensure that community events can still happen during the construction, pausing work for the festive period. The village remains lively, as residents navigate the changes and share their mixed feelings about the future of Romiley.
