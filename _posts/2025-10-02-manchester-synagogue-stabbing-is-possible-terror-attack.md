An attack outside a synagogue in north Manchester on October 2 is being investigated as a potential terror incident. Four people were injured when a car was driven into a crowd, and a security guard was stabbed. The police responded swiftly, declaring it a PLATO incident—UK's emergency protocol for terrorist attacks—with armed officers shooting the suspected attacker. The incident, occurring during Yom Kippur, led to a significant police presence at synagogues across Greater Manchester for public reassurance. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham acknowledged the seriousness of the situation but assured the public that the immediate threat had been managed effectively. Emergency services quickly arrived on the scene to assist the injured. The current condition of the victims and suspect remains unknown, and the area has been secured as investigations continue.
