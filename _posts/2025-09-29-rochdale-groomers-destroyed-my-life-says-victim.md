A schoolgirl from Rochdale has shared in court how grooming gangs have "destroyed my life." Known as Girl B during the trial, she bravely read her victim impact statement, encouraging others to report similar abuse. Judge Jonathan Seely commended both her and another victim, Girl A, for their "extraordinary courage" in speaking out and enduring the trial. Meanwhile, Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, and Kasir Bashir, 50, both from Oldham, were found guilty of multiple charges, including rape and indecency with a child, linked to Girl B's case.
