A driver recounted witnessing a crash near Welshpool, Wales, where Rhys Jenkins died and his nine-year-old son was severely injured. Rhys, 41, was involved in an accident caused by two brothers from Manchester, Abubakr and Umar Ben Yusaf, who are on trial for dangerous driving and other charges. Witnesses described the two cars, a red BMW X3 and a blue Audi S4, racing before the crash. One driver, Tyler Lewis, reported seeing a silver car in a hedge on fire moments after the collision. Another witness, Roy Jennings, noted the racing seemed very dangerous, especially with his seven-year-old son in the car. Various witnesses felt intimidated by the speed of the overtaking cars, with estimates suggesting speeds of 90-100mph on a 60mph limit road. Forensic investigators indicated the crash was severe, with both cars colliding in the Toyota's lane. The two brothers have denied the charges as the trial continues.
