Zack Polanski, from the Green Party, has reached out to Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell, urging her to support the Greens in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election. His plea comes after a new Omnisis poll indicates that Green candidate Hannah Spencer could lead with 22% of the vote, significantly ahead of Labour, which is now seen as a "distant third." In his letter, Polanski referenced Powell’s previous concerns that a split in the vote could favour Reform, stressing that it's crucial for Labour to back the Greens to block Reform's chances. The competition includes other candidates like Matt Goodwin for Reform and Angeliki Stogia for Labour. Polling data suggests close margins, with Green and Reform neck-and-neck, while many voters still haven't decided. Labour sources, however, dismissed the poll's validity, claiming its methodology to be unreliable and asserting that undecided voters are leaning towards them.
