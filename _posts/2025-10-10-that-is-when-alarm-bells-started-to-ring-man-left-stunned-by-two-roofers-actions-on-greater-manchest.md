Kevin Adshead, 58, from Greater Manchester, is experiencing significant stress after two incompetent roofers left him with a leaky roof and hefty repair bills. Kevin had already invested £20,000 in renovating his bungalow since buying it in November 2022. In March 2024, he hired a roofer who demanded £6,500 but failed to order materials or pay for scaffolding, ultimately abandoning the job. A second roofer, hired for £4,500, also left Kevin with leaks, resulting in a potential £16,000 repair bill for his damaged ceilings and roof. Kevin expressed feeling devastated and overwhelmed, having not finished any room in the house due to the ongoing issues. He uncovered that the roofers he hired were untrustworthy and has since learned to check for certifications before hiring tradespeople. To help with the mounting costs, Kevin has set up a GoFundMe page, hoping for support as he navigates this challenging situation.
