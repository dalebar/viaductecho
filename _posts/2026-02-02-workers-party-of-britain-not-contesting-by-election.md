The Workers Party of Britain, led by George Galloway, has decided not to run in the Gorton and Denton by-election, claiming it's for the "best interests of the working-class." They won’t name a candidate from their four contenders. This by-election follows Andrew Gwynne's resignation due to health issues linked to fallout from leaked WhatsApp messages. In the last general election, Gwynne secured 50.8% of the vote, while Galloway’s party received 10.3%, finishing fourth.

The Workers Party slammed Labour's performance in the constituency, branding them "the enemy of the British people" and blamed them for worsening conditions while criticizing government spending on the Ukraine conflict and plans for digital ID cards. They've suggested that Labour's push for change represents an attempt to replace Keir Starmer with a more palatable figure. The final list of candidates for the by-election will be updated as declarations come in.
