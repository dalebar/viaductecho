Councillors in Stockport are raising concerns about illegal parking, fly-tipping, and anti-social behaviour, calling for stronger enforcement to tackle these issues. During a recent council meeting, they focused on problems near Edgeley Park football stadium, where illegal parking is blocking driveways and creating hazards. Councillor Asa Caton emphasised the need to identify enforcement gaps and bring about “real consequences” for rule-breakers, as residents feel frustrated when reported issues aren’t addressed. There were also concerns about developers not fulfilling agreements, with specific issues noted on Chester Road and at Springmount Mill. Dan Oliver, Stockport's cabinet member for communities, defended the council's efforts, highlighting 23,000 parking fines issued in the last year—5,000 more than the previous year. The motion for tougher measures was agreed upon, aiming to improve the situation across the borough.
