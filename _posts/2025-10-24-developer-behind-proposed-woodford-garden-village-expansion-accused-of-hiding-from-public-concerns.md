A Stockport councillor expressed frustration and anger after a developer, Redrow Homes, failed to attend a public meeting to discuss their plans for 540 homes on green belt land near Woodford Garden Village. The expansion, submitted for approval in December, includes a community hub, but local councillors and residents voiced several concerns, particularly about the lack of a representative from Redrow to answer questions. Cllr Alex Wynne, chairing the meeting, was disappointed that the developer had appealed to the Planning Inspector before the council's decision. Residents highlighted issues such as worsening traffic congestion and lack of infrastructure, education provisions, and impact on the green belt. The proposed development includes various housing options and some commitments to provide more school places, though concerns remain about their delivery. Despite 86 objection letters from neighbours, Redrow's plans continue to move forward as the decision now lies with the Planning Inspector.
