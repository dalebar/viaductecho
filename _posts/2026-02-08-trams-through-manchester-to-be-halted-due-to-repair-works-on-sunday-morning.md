Tram services in Manchester city centre will face disruptions on Sunday morning due to track repairs. The Rochdale and Bury lines will end at Victoria, while the East Didsbury line will terminate at Exchange Square. There'll be a bus replacement service operating between Victoria and Piccadilly. If you're on the East Didsbury line and need to get to Victoria, it'll be a short five-minute walk from Exchange Square. The disruptions kick off at the start of operations and will wrap up by 10am. For more info, check out the updates on the Bee Network's website and social media.
