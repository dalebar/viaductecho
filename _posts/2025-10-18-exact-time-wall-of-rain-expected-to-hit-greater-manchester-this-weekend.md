It’s been a cloudy and grey Saturday in Manchester, with some light showers here and there. The Met Office suggests we might see some brighter spells and hazy sunshine later, with temperatures reaching about 14°C. Coastal areas will feel the winds picking up, but it’s all set to change with wet weather on the way. This evening should start off dry, but expect rain to move in later, hitting Greater Manchester around 9pm, accompanied by increasing winds and heavier rain overnight, with temps dropping to around 8°C. Sunday promises more cloud and wind, with heavy rain in the morning, but the wind should die down in the afternoon, and the rain should ease off by evening, with a high of 15°C. Looking ahead to next week, Monday brings sunshine mixed with heavy showers, while Tuesday may be drier with only a few showers. Wednesday looks changeable again with a chance of rain, but overall, it’ll be breezy with average temperatures. Stay prepared!
