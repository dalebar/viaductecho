Torrential rain has hit Greater Manchester hard, leading to eight flood warnings across the area. Public transport's been a bit of a mess, with submerged streets and several road closures. Flood alerts and warnings signal impending dangers, prompting locals to take safety measures. Conditions worsened around 11:30 pm, closing lanes on the M62, M61, and M56, while train services between Bolton and Blackburn were disrupted until 7:30 pm. Local officials kept residents informed, especially as rivers neared capacity. In Salford, flood basins might be used, but some areas, like Peel Green Road in Eccles, faced severe flooding. One resident even watched their car get overtaken by water, with their son struggling to reach safety. The Met Office has issued a yellow rain warning, highlighting the risk of flooding to homes and businesses. Stay safe out there!
