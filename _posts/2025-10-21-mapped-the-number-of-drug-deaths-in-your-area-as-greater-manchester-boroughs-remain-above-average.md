Last year saw record drug-related deaths in England and Wales, rising to 5,565, a 2% increase from 2023 and the highest since 1993. Synthetic opioids, especially nitazenes, have significantly contributed to this surge, with their associated deaths almost quadrupling. Most areas in Greater Manchester reported above-average mortality rates, except for Oldham and Rochdale. Blackpool had the highest mortality rate in the country, while the North of England faced notably higher death rates overall compared to the South. Sir Richard Branson highlighted the need for a shift towards treating drug use as a health issue rather than a crime, advocating for harm-reduction measures like drug checking services and supervised consumption rooms. Turning Point charity also called for better access to naloxone for reversing overdoses. The government responded with campaigns on drug dangers, stressing their commitment to reducing drug-related deaths through support and treatment, particularly in deprived areas. Overall, men were twice as likely to die from drug-related issues, and the average age of death was in the mid-45s.
