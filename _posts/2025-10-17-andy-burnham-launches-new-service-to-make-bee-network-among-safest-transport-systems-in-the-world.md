Andy Burnham has rolled out the TravelSafe LiveChat service, making the Bee Network a safer transport system. Launched on October 16, this service lets passengers report crime or anti-social behaviour via the Bee Network app, with real-time responses from Greater Manchester Police (GMP). Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes highlighted that trained staff will monitor incidents using an extensive camera network, ensuring quick and compassionate responses. 

If an issue arises, police officers or 'travel safe enforcement officers' will take action, including boardings on trams/buses or making announcements. Burnham introduced Chief Superintendent Sue Downey as the designated leader for this initiative, aiming for a greater uniformed presence on the system. He emphasized that the LiveChat service marks a significant improvement in passenger reporting and response time, enhancing overall safety and reassurance for users. The new command structure is expected to be in place by spring next year!
