Manchester Airport has had its busiest summer to date, with 6.8 million passengers travelling during the school holidays, including a record 3.5 million in August alone. Top destinations have been Antalya, Palma, Dublin, Amsterdam, and Dubai, and these are set to remain popular into September as people seek late summer deals. An impressive 91% of travellers rated their airport experience positively, and efficient security processes meant 95% waited 10 minutes or less in August. The summer surge coincides with the completion of a £1.3 billion transformation programme, particularly the new Terminal 2, which will serve over 70% of passengers with new amenities. Further upgrades to Terminal 3 are also underway, with new facilities opening early next year. Manchester Airport’s Managing Director Chris Woodroofe expressed pride in how they connect the North to the world and is optimistic about continued passenger satisfaction as enhancements roll out. Lastly, the airport shared helpful tips for summer travellers.
