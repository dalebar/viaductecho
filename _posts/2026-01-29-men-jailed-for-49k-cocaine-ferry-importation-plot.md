Kane Jones and Thomas Lindop, both from Failsworth near Manchester, have been sentenced for their roles in importing nearly £50,000 worth of cocaine to the Isle of Man. The pair admitted to coordinating the shipment via ferry in February 2025, with Lindop's fingerprints linking him directly to the drugs. The police uncovered the stash hidden in a vehicle driven by Scott Goulden, who has already received a nine-year sentence for related charges. 

Jones, 32, and Lindop, 39, received sentences of 10 years and 8 years respectively. The judge highlighted how their actions negatively impacted the local community, noting the misery caused by drug supply. They both expressed some remorse but not specifically for the harm caused to residents. Evidence from phone messages and drug-related items found in their homes supported their involvement in the organised crime group and highlighted the significant nature of their operations. Lindop attempted to claim that additional cocaine found on him was for personal use. Their conviction reflects the ongoing battle against drug-related crime in the region.
