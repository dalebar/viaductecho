Greater Manchester campaigners and those with visual impairments are relieved by new local council powers to tackle dangerous pavement parking. The Department of Transport has announced that councils can enforce restrictions on vehicles obstructing footpaths, which poses risks to pedestrians, especially families, wheelchair users, and the visually impaired. Although some motorists argue that they have little choice but to park on narrow residential streets, these new powers won't mean a blanket ban; councils will identify specific problem areas for targeted enforcement. Marie Howarth, a visually impaired resident, expressed her relief, noting how pavement obstructions often force her to step into traffic while navigating with her guide dog. The Guide Dogs CEO, Andrew Lennox, emphasized how blocked pavements hinder independence and access to everyday activities. Local MPs, including Afzal Khan and Kirith Entwistle, supported the changes, acknowledging the safety concerns while highlighting the need for tailored solutions in different communities. Overall, the localised approach aims to improve safety for all pedestrians while considering the unique challenges of various neighbourhoods.
