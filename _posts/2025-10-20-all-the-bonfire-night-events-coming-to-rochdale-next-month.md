Rochdale's gearing up for three fab free bonfire night events next month! On November 3, the fun kicks off at Bowlee Community Park in Middleton, followed by Heywood's Queen's Park Road on November 4, and wrapping up at Cronkeyshaw Common on November 6. Each event features a family funfair, food, and soft drinks, but no booze, fireworks, or sparklers are allowed. No need to book; just turn up! Bonfires light up at 7pm and fireworks start at 7.30pm. 

Plus, there's an extra treat with the Ignite Fire Festival from November 21 to 23, showcasing stunning fire displays and light installations. Itâ€™s expected to be a real crowd-pleaser, with the Christmas lights switch-on happening on November 23 at 5.30pm. So, if you fancy a bit of festive fire fun, get on down to Rochdale this November!
