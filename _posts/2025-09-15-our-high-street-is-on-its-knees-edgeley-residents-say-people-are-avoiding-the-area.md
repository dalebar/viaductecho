Castle Street in Edgeley, Stockport, is facing tough times, with local councillors noting that, despite a slight increase in footfall, traders are struggling. Although shop vacancy rates are low compared to other districts, the upcoming Stockport 8 development poses a challenge for existing businesses. Cllr Asa Caton highlighted this struggle, noting that the area is grappling with major engineering works that will disrupt traffic until 2026. 

Councillors are calling for a more tailored approach, rather than a one-size-fits-all strategy, to support local businesses. Problems such as waste management and cleanliness post-football matches were raised as urgent needs. Cllr Matt Wynne and Cllr Jon Byrne emphasised the necessity of attracting the right tenants and providing solid support to rejuvenate the high street. 

The council is working on initiatives, including brochures for new residents to showcase local shops and services, as well as a central information portal for local businesses. While there are some positive steps forward, the consensus is that more targeted efforts are needed to truly revive Castle Street.
