Two new Hilton hotels are set to open in Manchester city centre. The first, Hampton by Hilton Manchester City Centre, is a 22-storey tower on Deansgate, opening early next year. It will feature 358 rooms, a fitness area, meeting space, and dining options, making it the largest Hampton by Hilton in Europe. The second hotel, Motto by Hilton, is planned for 2027 near Piccadilly Basin, offering 154 compact rooms, a restaurant, bar, and fitness space. Together, these hotels will add over 500 rooms to Manchester’s accommodation scene. This expansion follows the June news that the Hilton in Beetham Tower would transition to an InterContinental hotel under HG Hotels and Resorts. Hilton's move aligns with rising demand, as the city attracts millions of visitors annually. Nick Smart from Hilton highlighted Manchester's appeal and their aim to deliver high-quality accommodation. Meanwhile, Adi Hodzic from Dean Street Developments expressed excitement about enhancing the city’s hospitality landscape.
