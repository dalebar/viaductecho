Tragically, a man was found dead outside Birch Tree Court in Wythenshawe on Sunday evening, October 19. Police confirmed there’s no evidence of 'third-party involvement,' and his death isn’t being treated as suspicious. Responding to concerns for welfare around 6.15pm, emergency crews pronounced him dead at the scene. A cordon was set up and a forensic tent was erected while the investigation took place.
