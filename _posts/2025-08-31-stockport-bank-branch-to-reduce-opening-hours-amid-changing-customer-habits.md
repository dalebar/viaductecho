A Stockport bank is reducing its opening hours.

Co-operative Bank has announced plans to change the opening hours of its branch
on St Petersgate.

From January 5, 2026, the branch will close two hours earlier on weekdays, at
2.30pm instead of 4.30pm, and it will be closed all day on Saturday and Sunday.

An impact assessment published by the bank reads: "Before we make changes at any
branch, we look at how our customers are managing their money and using the
branch.

"Before we make changes at any branch, we look at how our customers are managing
their money and using the branch.

"Most customers are now using mobile and online banking or calling us instead,
which means they are using branches, including the Stockport Branch much less."

According to the Co-op, the average number of transactions completed at their
Stockport branch counter each week has dropped by 60 percent over the last seven
years.

And in the past four years, 908 fewer personal customers have visited the branch
to complete a counter transaction.

Furthermore, in the 12 months to June 2025, the total number of business
customers who transacted in the branch was 2,372.

The impact assessment adds: "We are pleased to confirm we are not closing any
branches permanently, and have not done so since November 2020.

"These amendments to branch opening hours form part of the bank's strategy to
rebuild and reshape our business for the future, with a focus on responding to
the changes in the way customers are choosing to bank with us."
