The Co-operative Bank in Stockport is cutting back its branch hours starting January 5, 2026. The St Petersgate branch will now close at 2.30pm on weekdays, rather than 4.30pm, and will be shut on Saturdays and Sundays. This decision comes after an assessment revealed a 60% drop in weekly transactions over the past seven years, with many customers opting for mobile and online banking instead. In the last four years, nearly 1,000 fewer personal customers have visited for counter transactions, while 2,372 business customers used the branch in the year leading up to June 2025. The Co-op reassured that no branches are closing permanently, as it adapts to changing customer preferences and aims to reshape its operations for the future.
