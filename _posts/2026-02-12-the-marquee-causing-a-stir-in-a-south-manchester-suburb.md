In Whalley Range, a dispute over a 12-year-old marquee used by the British Muslim Heritage Centre (BMHC) may be settled soon after residents sent thousands of letters to the council. Neighbours are unhappy about noise and traffic from events, especially weddings, which they say lead to parking issues and disturbances. A residents' rep highlighted ongoing problems at a planning committee meeting, pushing for the marquee's use to end. However, some neighbours who support the BMHC argue it contributes positively to the community and is crucial for funding a planned £34m restoration of the mosque. In a recent ruling, councillors gave the BMHC another chance to prove it can manage the marquee effectively before a final decision is made on February 12. Council officers recommend refusing its use due to concerns over noise and traffic, particularly during late hours. The councillors will also consider a new development of nine flats nearby. The planning committee meeting is set for February 12 at 2pm, watch it online if you're keen to follow along!
