A boy suffered serious, potentially life-threatening injuries after being hit by a tram at the Crossacres Metrolink stop in Wythenshawe, south Manchester, on October 7. An extensive emergency response, including an air ambulance, was quickly mobilised at around 3.30 pm. The boy was rescued from under the tram and urgently taken to hospital. The area was cordoned off for investigation, leading to significant disruption, including cancelled tram services to Manchester Airport. Witnesses shared their shock, noting the heavy presence of emergency services. Greater Manchester Police confirmed they were working with Transport for Greater Manchester to manage the situation and advised on travel disruptions. The community is understandably concerned, with locals expressing their sympathies for the boy's family.
