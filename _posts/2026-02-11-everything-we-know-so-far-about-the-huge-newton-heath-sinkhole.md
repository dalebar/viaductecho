A sinkhole has opened on Briscoe Lane in Newton Heath due to a burst pipe, starting on February 10. Local residents are facing water issues, like low pressure or no water at all. The road's closed as United Utilities teams tackle the repairs. A local business owner has had to shut up shop because of the closure, resulting in missed appointments. United Utilities is aware of the situation and has deployed water tankers to maintain supply for residents. They’re working hard to fix the pipe and apologise for the trouble caused.
