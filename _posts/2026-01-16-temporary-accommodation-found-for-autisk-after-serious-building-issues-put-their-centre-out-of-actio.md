Autisk, a local charity providing support for families with autism and other learning difficulties, has temporarily relocated to Adswood Primary School after being forced to leave their main centre due to serious building safety issues. This arrangement will last until February half-term while they work closely with Stockport Council to secure a long-term venue. The council expressed gratitude to Adswood Primary for quickly offering a safe space, ensuring vital support continues for children and families without interruption. They understand the situation may cause some anxiety and are collaborating with Parents and Carers Together Stockport to manage the transition smoothly. Overall, the focus remains on maintaining support and finding a permanent solution.
