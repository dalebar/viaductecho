Two-year-old Jude Owens from Manchester has made waves in the snooker world by setting multiple Guinness World Records as the youngest person to pull off two trick shots. Recently, he nailed a pool bank shot at just two years and 302 days old and scored a snooker double pot weeks earlier. His dad, Luke, recognised Jude's snooker knack early on, saying he’s got more natural talent than he did at ten.

Despite the challenges of finding the right equipment, they adapted by using a cooking stool for Jude's shots. Confident and cheeky, Jude declared he'd win in a match against his dad. Besides snooker, he’s also a big Manchester United fan and can belt out karaoke hits like "Take Me Home, Country Roads."

Guinness World Records editor Craig Glenday praised Jude’s skill and passion, noting how incredible it is to see such talent at such a young age. What a little star!
