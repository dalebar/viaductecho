Ellis Eyles, a former prison officer at HMP Deerbolt, has been sentenced to eight months in jail for misconduct after forming a relationship with convicted murderer Mitchell Ingham. Ingham is serving a life sentence for the 2016 murder of Dominic Doyle in Denton. Eyles, 21 at the time, provided him with information about another inmate he intended to harm, using an illicit phone to communicate with him. Their exchanges included romantic messages and discussions about harm towards others. Manchester Crown Court heard the pair had maintained contact through texts and video calls, with one call lasting 37 minutes. Judge Richard Bennett stated that her actions compromised her colleagues' duties and eroded public trust in the Prison Service. Defence attorney Robert Mochrie argued that Eyles, now 24 and from Darlington, was inexperienced and manipulated by Ingham. Despite her fall from grace, he highlighted her strong work ethic, mentioning her subsequent employment at a bank where she helped a customer avoid a scam. Ingham was also sentenced to nine months for his phone offences in prison.
