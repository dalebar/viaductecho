A woman has shared her experience of marrying Manchester synagogue attacker Jihad Al-Shamie during a quick online Islamic ceremony in early 2022, all while sitting in her front room. Al-Shamie, who later carried out a fatal knife and car attack outside a synagogue on Yom Kippur (October 2), had pushed her into marrying him, claiming they needed to be wed before pursuing a relationship. The woman had previously converted to Islam and at first believed she was in love with him, but revealed that Al-Shamie was abusive and manipulative throughout their time together. Their marriage, completed via a brief video call, included an Islamic Nikah ceremony and was witnessed by others online. Despite their marriage certificate, Al-Shamie had never granted her a divorce, and their communications revealed ongoing manipulations. Tragically, Al-Shamieâ€™s actions during the assault resulted in the deaths of two people and injuries to four others before he was shot dead by police.
