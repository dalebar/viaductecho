In Greater Manchester, there’s a stunning four-bedroom detached house up for sale in Alkrington, Middleton, priced at £1.3 million. This impressive family home spans three floors, offering around 3,000 square feet of space, including a cinema room, gym, and a lovely garden with a terrace for outdoor entertaining. It features a stylish open-plan kitchen, spacious reception rooms, and a well-designed landscape for privacy.

The property, marketed by Ryder & Dutton, is situated in the desirable 'woodside' area, accessible via electric gates with ample parking. It also boasts a flexibility of use for an outbuilding, currently set up as a games room but could easily become a home office. 

Alkrington Garden Village is known for its green spaces, including the Alkrington Woods Nature Reserve, with average house prices in the area witnessing a 3% increase over the past year. Overall, a unique and spacious family home in a lovely setting!
