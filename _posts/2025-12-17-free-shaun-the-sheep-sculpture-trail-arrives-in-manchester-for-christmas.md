Manchester is buzzing this festive season with a free Shaun the Sheep sculpture trail called "Find the Flock." It features six stunning sculptures scattered around Spinningfields and St John's, with families invited to hunt them down. Notable pieces include Shaun The Shape at Aviva Studios and The Bee Sheeper by John Rylands Library. The trail runs alongside the European premiere of the "Shaun the Sheep's Circus Show" at Aviva Studios, presented by the acclaimed Circa ensemble and Aardman, running until January 4. Expect thrilling acrobatics and the signature humour of Shaun the Sheep. 

Maps for the trail are available at John Rylands Library or Aviva Studios, and there are additional activities at Aviva until January 11, like creative family drop-ins and free PlayStation sessions. Between December 17 and January 10, don’t miss the Glam Station for nail and body art. Tickets for the circus show start from £10 and can be booked online. Check out the full programme for more details.
