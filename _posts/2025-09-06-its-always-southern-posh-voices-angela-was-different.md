Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy Prime Minister has sparked mixed feelings in her constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne. While some residents believe she faced unfair treatment due to her working-class background and accent, they also acknowledge the need for accountability after she admitted to failing to pay £40,000 in stamp duty on a seaside apartment. A recent investigation concluded she breached the ministerial code, leading to her exit from government roles. Many in the area, including supporters who saw her as relatable and a role model, expressed disappointment at her departure, feeling it signalled a loss of representation for the working class at the highest levels of politics. Local sentiments reflect a belief that criticism of Rayner often focused on personal traits rather than her political actions. Ultimately, while there’s sympathy for her plight, there’s a consensus that she must be held to the same standards as everyone else. Residents worry that her replacement may not reflect the diversity and authenticity she brought to the role, emphasising a perceived shift away from Northern representation in government.
