The Home Secretary has revealed that Jihad Al-Shamie, the man responsible for the recent synagogue attack in Manchester, was not known to police and had no prior investigations against him. Al-Shamie, 35, drove a car into worshippers outside the Heaton Park synagogue on Yom Kippur before launching a knife attack, which resulted in two deaths and several injuries. He was shot dead by police at the scene, who later determined that his explosive vest was not viable. Al-Shamie, a British citizen since 2006, had lived in Prestwich and was not part of the Prevent anti-radicalisation scheme. The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, expressed surprise at his name and confirmed that police investigations are ongoing, with three others arrested on related terrorism charges. The victims, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were remembered by police, who expressed condolences to their families. In the wake of the attack, increased police presence and cordons remain in place across north Manchester as investigations continue.
