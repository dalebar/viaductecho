Drivers in Greater Manchester should plan ahead this weekend (November 28-30) as eight roads will be closed for scheduled roadworks. Most closures will occur overnight, coinciding with a busy weekend featuring sold-out events at Co-op Live and the AO Arena, plus a Manchester City game against Leeds. The influx of visitors for the Christmas Markets and Black Friday shopping will be massive, especially considering 1.2 million journeys were made last weekend without a major match. Transport for Greater Manchester highly recommends using public transport and has set up four pop-up park and ride locations with 1,000 free parking spaces available. Motorists are encouraged to re-route or adjust their travel times, particularly due to overnight roadworks on five motorways.
