On a sunny Valentine’s Day in Denton, Labour heavyweights Ed Miliband and Andy Burnham rallied support for candidate Angeliki Stogia ahead of the Gorton and Denton by-election. As Labour faces increasing competition from the Green Party and Reform UK, Miliband emphasised the campaign's focus on unity and progress, urging voters to reject divisive politics. Amid recent criticisms, including the Trigger Me Timbers WhatsApp scandal, both Miliband and Burnham acknowledged community anger but highlighted positive actions taken to improve local issues—like low bus fares and plans for a tram connection. They expressed commitment to delivering tangible benefits for residents. While challenges loom for Labour, including controversies affecting leadership, Miliband insisted their focus should remain on the pressing national issues. Burnham echoed this sentiment, advocating for radical changes to government structures, like replacing the House of Lords. Overall, the duo stressed that Stogia embodies the values needed to represent the community effectively.
