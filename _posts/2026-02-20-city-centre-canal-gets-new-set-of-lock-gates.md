In Manchester's gay village, new bespoke oak lock gates have been installed on the Rochdale Canal, replacing old gates that had seen better days. The project, which took place on 14 and 15 February, involved draining 110,000 gallons of water and using an 80-tonne crane to position the new three-tonne gates. It cost around £165,000, covering various expenses like scaffolding and security. Draining the canal also revealed a mix of items from different eras, including mobiles, knives, and even umbrellas! Built in 1804 for transporting heavy loads, the canal fell into disrepair by 1952 but was fully reopened in 2002 after significant restoration. Now, as many gates reach their 25-year lifespan, maintenance continues to be crucial. Stephen Foulds from the Canal and River Trust reflected on the impressive longevity of some structures, built by hand over 250 years ago, showcasing the rich history of the canal.
