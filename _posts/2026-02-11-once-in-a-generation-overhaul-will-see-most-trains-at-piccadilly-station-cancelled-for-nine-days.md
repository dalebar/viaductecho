Manchester Piccadilly will close for nine days from February 14 to 22 for major track and signalling upgrades costing nearly £8 million. This overhaul aims to improve reliability and reduce future disruptions, as much of the current infrastructure is outdated. Trains from the south and east won't run into the station during the closure, affecting local services and direct links to Manchester Airport. 

In response, Network Rail and Transport for Greater Manchester are arranging rail replacement buses and accepting rail tickets for bus and tram journeys. Passengers are advised to plan their travels carefully, as services will be busy. While the main train platforms will be closed, the concourse will remain open, with limited service from designated platforms. 

Key messages from officials highlight the importance of this update for long-term reliability, though they acknowledge the temporary disruption it may cause. Customers are encouraged to check online resources for real-time updates and alternative routes.
