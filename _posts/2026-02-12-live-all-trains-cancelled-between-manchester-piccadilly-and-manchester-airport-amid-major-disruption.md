All trains between Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport are cancelled this afternoon due to a points failure near Heald Green. This disruption affects Northern, TransPennine Express, and Transport for Wales services, and major delays are expected until at least 5pm. 

Passengers are encouraged to use the Metrolink trams or buses for travel instead. While limited train services are running, many routes are either completely disrupted or only partially operational. Specific routes that can’t currently service the airport include those from Windermere and Barrow-In-Furness. However, Northern services from Manchester Piccadilly to Crewe are largely unaffected.

National Rail is actively working to resolve the issues, so travellers are advised to check for real-time updates on their platform. Stay tuned for live updates as the situation develops!
