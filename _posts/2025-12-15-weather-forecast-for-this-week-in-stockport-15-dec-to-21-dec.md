This week in Stockport is mainly cloudy with some rain showers early on. Humidity will be high, and temperatures will vary from a chill of 3°C to a peak of 11°C. Monday kicks off with consistent rain, while Tuesday sees a chilly start and slight drying. Wednesday brings back some blustery winds, and occasional rain continues through Thursday. By Friday, expect more clouds and early showers, with the weekend shaping up to be drier, though still cool. 

Commuters should be careful on slippery roads, especially at the week’s start, and carry rain gear. For weekend plans, Saturday and Sunday should offer better conditions for outdoor activities, but remember to layer up for comfort in the cool weather.
