Stepping Hill Hospital has unveiled its new outpatients building, which boasts state-of-the-art equipment and 50 rooms dedicated to various services, including cancer care, dentistry, cardiology, and more. The facility is set to be fully operational in the coming weeks, situated on the northern part of the hospital site where old wards were demolished.

An opening ceremony was attended by local MPs and representatives from Stockport NHS Foundation Trust and contractors MTX, who utilized innovative modular construction methods to build the new centre. Work commenced in January 2024 after the previous building was found unsuitable.

Karen James OBE, Chief Executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, expressed excitement over the opening and highlighted the efficient partnership involved in the project. Paul Williams, MTX Project Director, shared pride in creating a welcoming and functional space aimed at enhancing patient and staff experiences. Both express optimism for the new beginning at the facility.
