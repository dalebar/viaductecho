Today in Stockport, expect a cloudy day with early morning rain and temperatures ranging from 6°C to 12°C. High humidity at 87% means it’ll feel rather damp, and there's a 100% chance of more rain throughout the day, so best grab a waterproof coat and umbrella. Winds will be around 15 mph, adding a bit of chill to the air. 

If you're commuting, be ready for wet and slippery roads—allow extra travel time and stay updated on public transport, as there might be delays. Dress in layers to keep comfortable, and if you had outdoor plans, it might be wise to pivot to something indoors. Just keep that umbrella close!
