Chris Green, a former Tory MP for Bolton West, has switched to Reform UK after losing his seat in the July 2024 election. He’s joined by fellow ex-MPs Jonathan Gullis from Stoke-on-Trent North and Lia Nici from Grimsby. Green took a swipe at the Conservatives, blaming their 14 years in power for Labour’s recent general election win. He expressed disappointment in Labour, believing they’d have a solid plan after their time in opposition. Green pointed out that while the Conservatives might say the right things, they've lost the public's trust. He’s excited about Reform UK's vision for the country and believes they understand the underlying issues facing Britain. Before his political career, Green worked in mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography for nearly two decades. He served in various parliamentary committees and was part of the Conservative 1922 Committee executive before his return to the life science industry post-defeat.
