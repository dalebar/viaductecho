Survivors of a tragic crash in Bolton that claimed four lives have bravely shared their harrowing experience. The collision happened around 12.45am on January 11, involving a taxi and a speeding car. Georgina Daniels, 28, and her husband Tom, 29, were among the four passengers in the taxi, now both in hospital with serious injuries. Georgina expressed disbelief that they survived, noting the pain and emotional toll has been overwhelming. The couple, recently married, now face life-changing injuries and will require long-term care. Fundraisers have emerged to support their recovery, with nearly £24,000 raised towards a £40,000 goal. The investigation is still ongoing, with accounts suggesting reckless driving contributed to the crash. The Daniels are calling for better road safety awareness, highlighting the devastating loss of their taxi driver, Masrob Ali. As they navigate their recovery, they aim to stay hopeful and supportive of each other, although their future feels uncertain.
