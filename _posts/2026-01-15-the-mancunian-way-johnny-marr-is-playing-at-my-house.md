Residents near Wythenshawe Park are split over the impact of 'super concerts' held in the park, with some loving the vibe and others feeling stressed by noise and congestion. The park's first concert was three years ago, featuring Noel Gallagher, which drew 25,000 fans. Upcoming shows include The Cure and Courteeners, with five major events planned this August. While some locals wish the music was louder, others are concerned about litter and traffic issues, though an uptick in police presence has improved the situation. The council promises that local charities will benefit from community funds generated by these events.

In a tragic separate story, Amelia Ali admitted to manslaughter in the death of her grandmother Judith Zussman during a mental health crisis. The case raises ongoing questions about the care and safety of individuals facing mental health challenges. Meanwhile, Oscar Murphy from Bury is pioneering innovative CAR-T therapy for cancer, expressing hope for the future as he aims to return to normal life after his treatment. Lastly, road closures due to ongoing works are affecting traffic in various areas around Manchester.
