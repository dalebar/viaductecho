Isobel Lepist, a Stockport author, has released her debut thriller, *The Event*, featuring a neurodivergent protagonist, Nisba. Set in Uzbekistan, Nisba, a high-achieving professional from Manchester, finds herself in risky circumstances while connecting with a Ukrainian war veteran. Inspired by Isobel's own late diagnoses of autism and ADHD at 52, the story highlights the inner struggles faced by many women who appear successful yet grapple with anxiety and overwhelm. Isobel aims to convey these themes through a fast-paced narrative, allowing readers to experience neurodivergence intimately rather than just through clinical explanations. She hopes to make women with similar experiences feel seen and understood. Alongside writing, Isobel works as an ADHD coach and runs At The Millpond, an initiative supporting neurodivergent adults, especially women. *The Event* is available on Amazon.
