Lazo Minimarket in Droylsden has been shut down due to ongoing criminal activity. The shop's licence holder, Fardin Khezri, faced the Tameside council’s licensing panel after multiple visits by authorities since April 2024, resulting in the seizure of over 1,800 illegal cigarettes. A significant bust occurred on October 13, 2025, where authorities confiscated 1,558 cigarette packets and various other illegal items. Khezri, who bought the shop in October 2025, claimed he wasn't aware of the illegal goods and that he had changed operations to ensure compliance. Although a later inspection confirmed compliance, evidence of long-standing criminal behaviour led the panel, chaired by Coun Helen Bowden, to revoke the shop's licence, preventing it from selling alcohol and age-restricted items. Khezri expressed that the licence revocation felt "completely unfair". PC Craig Foley emphasised the connection between counterfeit goods and other criminal activities, asserting that tackling this trade will enhance community safety.
