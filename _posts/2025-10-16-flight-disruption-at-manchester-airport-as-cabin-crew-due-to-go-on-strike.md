Flight disruptions are on the horizon at Manchester Airport with over 100 cabin crew from Aer Lingus planning to strike from October 30 to November 2. They're unhappy with a proposed 9% pay rise for this year and 3% for next year, rejecting it in a vote where 90% of workers backed industrial action. This walkout is expected to seriously affect flights to destinations like Dublin, Boston, and Barbados from Terminal 2. Aer Lingus expressed disappointment, noting they had negotiated in good faith and had previously reached competitive pay deals. The airline is now focusing on communicating with customers to minimise the disruption. Unite's regional officer mentioned that the union believes the crew had no choice but to strike and urged the airline to return to negotiations. It's going to be a tough time for those travelling during this period!
