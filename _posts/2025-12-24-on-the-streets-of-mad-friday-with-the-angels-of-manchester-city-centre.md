On Mad Friday in Manchester's Gay Village, festive party vibes are in full swing, but a volunteer has opted to join the Village Angels instead of partying. This initiative, run by the LGBT Foundation, offers support to vulnerable individuals on busy nights, ensuring their safety and wellbeing. The Angels, who have patrolled since 2022, provide various forms of assistance, including first aid, comfort, and help with transportation.

Throughout a six-hour shift, volunteers encountered various situations: comforting a woman in distress, assisting a girl who had collapsed, and dealing with more serious medical issues, including a diabetic seizure. The volunteers operate in teams for safety, prioritising consent and managing aggressive situations without confrontation. 

Despite the challenges, there's a palpable sense of respect and appreciation from the community, with the Angels positively impacting over 500 people in just a year. The experience highlights the essential, heartwarming role of the Village Angels in fostering safety and support, showcasing the importance of such initiatives in LGBTQ+ spaces.
