The M67 motorway in Greater Manchester has partially closed due to a lorry crash this morning, December 18. The eastbound section is shut between junctions one at Denton Island and two for Hyde. The closure, which occurred around 9.35am after the collision reported just before 7am, is necessary for the recovery of the lorry. National Highways is managing traffic and implementing strategic closures, but there’s no estimate for when the road will reopen. Delays are expected, so it’s best to look for alternative routes. Keep an eye out for updates as this situation evolves!
