Tragically, Vicki Attenborough, a dedicated Green Party secretary in Bolton, has been named as one of the two women killed by a car on a country road in Smithills. The incident occurred around 7.40am on December 22. Vicki, aged 59, was heavily involved in environmental causes and had run for MP in last year's General Election. Her family described her as a loved wife, mother, and friend, who cherished family and was passionate about social justice, fundraising, and volunteering. She was also known for her love of open water swimming and her golden retriever, Jake. The driver of the car, a 19-year-old man, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Flowers and heartfelt tributes have been left at the scene. Greater Manchester Police are investigating and have appealed for information or footage related to the incident.
