A 98-year-old woman in Manchester had a cherished bracelet stolen during a distraction theft on January 10. While sitting on her walking frame on Dale Street, she was approached by two women who engaged her in conversation before swiping the family heirloom off her wrist. On the same day, two women tried a similar tactic on another woman on Oxford Street. Police arrested three women, aged 27, 33, and 35, on suspicion of theft, and they’re currently in custody. The search is still on for the stolen bracelet, and police have released an image of it to aid their appeal. They encourage anyone with information, including if they’ve seen the bracelet for sale or offered it, to reach out. Reports can be made via 101 or the GMP Live Chat, quoting the crime reference number CRI/06A2/0000963/26, or you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
