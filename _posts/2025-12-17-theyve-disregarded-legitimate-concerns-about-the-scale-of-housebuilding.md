Stockport council leader Mark Roberts has voiced strong opposition to plans for a new town with up to 20,000 homes near the Adlington area in Cheshire. He feels this development, just a few miles from Stockport, could severely strain the borough's roads and public services, and he criticises the government for ignoring local concerns regarding these proposals. Despite Stockport council’s commitment to a brownfield-first development approach, the government has imposed higher housebuilding targets following Labour's recent election win. Roberts urges the government to engage more with local residents instead of imposing developments. In contrast, the Ministry of Housing insists their plans will balance housing needs with environmental protections.
