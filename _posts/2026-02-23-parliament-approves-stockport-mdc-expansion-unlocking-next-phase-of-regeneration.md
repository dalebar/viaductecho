Stockport’s regeneration is on the up! Parliament has given the green light to expand the Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) to cover the entire town centre, boosting plans to build 8,000 new homes by 2040. These homes will cater to all lifestyles, alongside essential facilities like a new secondary school and health hub. The MDC's area will triple in size, enabling a focused approach to developing public spaces and improving links for walking and cycling. 

Since its formation in 2019 by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, the MDC has delivered notable projects such as the award-winning Stockport Interchange and the conversion of the historic Weir Mill. Looking ahead, the Stockport 8 project will add around 1,300 homes and vibrant public squares. Both Cllr Mark Roberts and Mayor Burnham have emphasised the success of this model, showcasing it as a blueprint for other towns in the region, aiming for beneficial growth and opportunities for all residents. Stockport is certainly setting the pace for urban regeneration!
