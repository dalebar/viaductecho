Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, emphasised that everyone in the region should have a clear pathway to decent jobs as he celebrated the opening of the University of Salford's new Greater Manchester Institute of Technology (GMIoT). This £14.3 million facility aims to provide higher-level technical courses in fields like esports, construction, and digital media, featuring modern classrooms and a wellbeing garden. 

Burnham highlighted the link between good jobs and a secure life, urging young people to aspire to ambitious futures. The GMIoT will foster collaborations between the university and local colleges to meet industry needs, particularly in construction and digital tech, bridging education and job markets. Strategic partnerships with companies like the BBC and GCHQ will also offer students work placements.

Jo Purves from the university noted that the GMIoT is vital for aligning training with industry demands and addressing local skills gaps. Claire Foreman, GMIoT director, echoed this sentiment, excited about inspiring the next generation of professionals in Manchester, which is rapidly growing but faces challenges in skill development. Teaching at the new facility is set to commence in September.
