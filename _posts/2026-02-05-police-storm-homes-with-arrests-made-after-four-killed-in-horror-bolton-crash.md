Four people were arrested in Bolton following a tragic head-on crash on Wigan Road, which resulted in the deaths of four individuals, including the drivers and passengers of two vehicles. The arrests include a 42-year-old woman and a 46-year-old man on suspicion of fraud, a 22-year-old man for handling stolen goods, and an 18-year-old for aggravated vehicle taking. In the crash, a red Seat Leon collided with a taxi, leaving survivors with severe injuries and sparking a fundraiser that has raised £50,000 for those affected. The driver of the taxi, Masrob Ali, was remembered as a devoted father, while the family of passenger Mohammed-Danyaal Asghar-Ali expressed their heartbreak. Investigators from Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward as they progress in their investigation. The inquests for the deceased have been opened and adjourned, while there are ongoing efforts to support the injured victims and their families.
