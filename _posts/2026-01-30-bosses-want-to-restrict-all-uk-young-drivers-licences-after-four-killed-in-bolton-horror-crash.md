Transport leaders in Greater Manchester are pushing to restrict driving licences for young drivers following a series of tragic incidents, including a recent crash in Bolton that killed four people. Statistics show a worrying rise in road fatalities, with 2024 seeing more deaths than the previous year. Greater Manchester's active travel commissioner, Dame Sarah Storey, highlighted the shocking behaviour of some drivers linked to these incidents and advocates for a 'vision zero' strategy to eliminate road casualties by 2040. She’s calling for a shift towards 'graduated drivers' licences'—similar to those being introduced in Northern Ireland—which would impose stricter rules on new drivers. This includes restrictions on night driving for under-24s and special requirements for learner drivers. Additional safety initiatives planned include road safety training for primary school students and a dedicated education programme for young drivers by the fire service.
