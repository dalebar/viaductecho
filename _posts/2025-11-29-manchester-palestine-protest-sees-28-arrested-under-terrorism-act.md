This afternoon in Manchester, a pro-Palestine protest at St Peter's Square led to 28 arrests under the Terrorism Act. Protesters, some displaying support for the banned group Palestine Action, gathered to voice their opinions. Palestine Action, designated a terrorist organisation by the UK earlier this year, has been involved in significant property damage tied to protests against UK arms sales to Israel. About 200 demonstrators attended, alongside a few anti-protesters. Greater Manchester Police confirmed the arrests, noting their efforts to minimise disruption in the area. As tensions rose, officers carried away some individuals while various chants echoed through the crowd. The protest eventually dispersed, signalling an end to the day’s events.
