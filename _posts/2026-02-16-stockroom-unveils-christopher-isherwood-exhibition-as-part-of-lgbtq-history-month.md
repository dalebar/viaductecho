Christopher Isherwood's 'Berlin Stories' has been revived in a unique exhibit at Stockroom, celebrating LGBTQ+ History Month and Isherwood's legacy nearly 40 years after his death. Known for classics like 'Goodbye to Berlin', Isherwood’s early life in the Stockport area is often overlooked. Born in 1904 at Wyberslegh Hall, he distanced himself from his wealthy family, which contributed to his later writings, including 'The Memorial', about a closeted gay man post-war. After rejecting conventional expectations, Isherwood moved to Germany, where he embraced the burgeoning gay liberation movement. His works later influenced the Broadway musical 'Cabaret'. Despite his fame, Isherwood often felt cursed by his family's legacy, particularly connected to an ancestor who signed King Charles I's death warrant. The exhibit at Stockroom is a rare opportunity to explore his personal history, with original items on display, including one long-thought-lost handmade picture book. Scholars like Andrew Biswell advocate for greater recognition of Isherwood’s Stockport roots, suggesting a festival to celebrate his influence and relevance today.
