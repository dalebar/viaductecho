Transport services in Greater Manchester are facing disruptions after a car collided with a railway bridge in Levenshulme this evening. The incident, occurring around 7pm, has blocked the West Coast Main Line, causing delays and cancellations for various routes, including Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern, TransPennine Express, and Transport for Wales services. Passengers can expect delays of up to 30 minutes, with some services diverting via Styal. Additionally, service interruptions from Storm Goretti continue to impact operations, especially for East Midlands Railway running between Liverpool Lime Street and Stockport, though they aim to resume tomorrow. Keep an eye on updates as the situation unfolds.
