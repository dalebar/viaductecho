Serial killers, often feared and reviled, tap into a dark aspect of human nature that many struggle to comprehend. Despite their horrifying acts, there's a huge public fascination with true crime, seen in the popularity of series like Netflix's *MONSTER: The Ed Gein Story*. People are drawn to these narratives out of morbid curiosity and a sense of safety while exploring the human psyche. In the UK, documented serial killers are rare, with around 62 cases recorded over nearly 200 years. Notable examples include Mary Ann Britland, who poisoned her family in 1886, and Trevor Hardy, known as 'The Beast of Manchester,' who committed murders in the 1970s. Peter Sutcliffe, the 'Yorkshire Ripper,' and Harold Shipman, infamous as 'Dr Death,' are other chilling figures—Sutcliffe murdered 13 women and Shipman killed potentially over 200 patients. Each case reflects not only the individuals’ brutality but also a societal obsession that continues to spark interest in the macabre.
