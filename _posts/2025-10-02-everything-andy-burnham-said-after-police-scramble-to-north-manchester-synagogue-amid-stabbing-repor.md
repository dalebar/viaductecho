Andy Burnham has assured Greater Manchester that the "immediate danger has been averted" following a serious incident outside the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall. Armed police arrived quickly after reports of a car being driven into the public and a stabbing. The suspect was shot on site, and while it's believed he has died, that hasn't been confirmed yet. Four bystanders sustained injuries related to both the vehicle and the stabbing. Burnham emphasised that while the situation is more under control, the area is still active and should be avoided. He expressed concern for the Jewish community, especially given that it coincides with Yom Kippur, a significant day for them. The mayor noted the strong relationship between police and community security, aiming to provide reassurance amidst heightened sensitivities in these times.
