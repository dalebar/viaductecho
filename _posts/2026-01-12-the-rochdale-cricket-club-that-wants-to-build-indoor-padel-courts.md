Milnrow Cricket Club in Rochdale is planning to build two covered padel courts to enhance its community offerings. This addition will require replacing two existing tennis courts but will keep the cricket pitch, petanque area, bowling green, and 5-a-side football pitch intact. Padel is a fun racket sport merging tennis and squash, played on a smaller enclosed court. The club already serves as a community hub with its weddings, beer festivals, and various sports, and it has consistently improved its facilities since it was founded in 1857. Recent upgrades include a grant for artificial practice areas in 2010 and a renovated function room in 2020, which is now a popular venue for events. The clubhouse is vibrant, with daily bar offerings and various activities. Overall, the addition of padel courts continues the club's commitment to fostering community spirit and engaging activities.
