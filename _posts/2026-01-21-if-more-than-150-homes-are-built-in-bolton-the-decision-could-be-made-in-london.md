Bolton's council is pushing back against plans that would strip local committees of the power to decide on developments of 150 homes or more, labelling it a 'serious erosion of democracy.' Veteran Conservative councillor John Walsh led a debate expressing concern over the proposal that such decisions would be made directly by the government instead. The council aims to send strong letters to Bolton's MPs, asking them to support local decision-making in planning. Walsh highlighted the importance of community involvement in expressing concerns over applications, stressing that losing local control weakens democracy. Labour councillor Akhtar Zaman supported the motion but argued that Walsh misunderstood the minister's statement, explaining that the government aims to streamline the appeals process rather than completely remove local authority. Zaman noted that local councils would still be involved, as any blocked projects would be reviewed by an independent planning inspector before a government decision. Another councillor, John McHugh, also backed the motion, emphasising the disconnect between local needs and decisions made from afar.
