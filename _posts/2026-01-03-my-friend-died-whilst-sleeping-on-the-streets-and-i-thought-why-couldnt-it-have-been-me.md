In Manchester, the chilling impact of homelessness is highlighted by the tragic death of 47-year-old Anthony Horn, found dead after sleeping rough in the freezing cold. A fellow rough sleeper, who had been friends with Horn, reflects on their shared struggles and the indifference of the system. Many choose to remain outdoors, refusing offers of temporary shelter due to fears of overcrowding and uncomfortable conditions. A makeshift camp near Lincoln Square reveals others enduring similar hardships, often with no access to basic necessities. Despite the council's outreach efforts and emergency protocols during severe weather, individuals frequently decline accommodation due to deep-seated trust issues and traumatic pasts. Experts indicate that breaking these barriers is crucial for effective support and long-term solutions. As temperatures drop, the risks for those sleeping rough escalate, with many left contemplating their choices and futures on the streets. The deputy leader of the council emphasises ongoing support and cold weather provisions, aiming to connect those in need with help and accommodation year-round.
