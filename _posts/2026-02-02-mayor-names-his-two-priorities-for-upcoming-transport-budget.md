Andy Burnham has outlined two main priorities for his upcoming transport budget: introducing a bus pass for children in temporary accommodation who live more than a 30-minute walk from school, and creating a 'carers and companions' pass. He emphasised that while the need is clear, the implementation depends on financial feasibility. This announcement follows unanimous support from Manchester council to push for the temporary accommodation pass, which has been backed by eight Greater Manchester MPs and various charities. Green Party leader Coun Astrid Johnson highlighted that a unified approach could ease financial pressure on councils and help fight child poverty. Coun Joanna Midgley from the ruling Labour group also stressed the importance of addressing the trauma caused by temporary accommodation and mentioned ongoing efforts to reduce homelessness.
