A group, led by 40-year-old Muhammed Usman Saeed, is on trial for allegedly orchestrating a £25 million tax rebate fraud using stolen identities. Alongside him, several co-defendants face charges for conspiring to cheat HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Prosecutors claim they created over 300 fake businesses, using identities stolen from a recruitment firm, to fabricate claims for research and development rebates. The scam involved producing false documentation and registering the companies with Companies House, all from premises in Stockport. Despite each defendant denying the charges, prosecutors argue this was a well-planned operation fuelled by greed. They highlight that the group's attempts amounted to millions, which could fund essential public services, likening it to the cost of running critical hospital beds. The case is ongoing at Minshull Street Crown Court.
