Rail services between West Yorkshire and Manchester are disrupted until Thursday due to a fire in a maintenance vehicle that occurred over the weekend. Network Rail is working to remove the vehicle from the challenging 3.5-mile tunnel, which has damage from the heat that needs repairing. Passengers travelling from Manchester to Huddersfield should use Manchester Victoria and change at Dewsbury for rail replacement services.
