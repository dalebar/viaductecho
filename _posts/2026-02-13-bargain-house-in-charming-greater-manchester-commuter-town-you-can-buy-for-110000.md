A charming one-bedroom mid-terraced house is up for grabs in Littleborough, Rochdale, priced at £110,000—a real bargain for the area! Nestled in the beautiful Pennines, this property offers stunning views and easy access to independent shops and cafes in the picturesque town centre. Perfect for commuters, you can reach Manchester city centre in just 20 minutes by train while enjoying the perks of rural living. Recent stats show Littleborough's properties have an average price of £234,818, making this home a steal for first-time buyers or as a cosy city getaway. The house features a spacious lounge with a log burner, a well-equipped kitchen, a large bedroom with fitted wardrobes, a three-piece bathroom, and a cellar across two rooms. With the town centre, train station, and Hollingworth Lake just a short stroll away, this spot is great for scenic walks and local dining. Gill Davies from Andrew Kelly & Associates invites viewings to fully appreciate this lovely rural retreat.
