An 18th-century building in Rochdale, formerly ‘The Nile’ nightclub and originally the Wellington Hotel, is set to be converted into apartments. Located at the corner of Drake and Smith Streets, this Georgian structure has been empty for a while, most recently housing the Bombay Brew restaurant. Developers, Cassel & Fletcher, have secured planning permission to transform the upper floors into 10 apartments and create a seven-bedroom house of multiple occupation (HMO) on the third floor. The apartments will feature a mix of one and two-bed homes, plus a studio, though the ground floor commercial space won’t be included in the plans. There's no car parking provided, but it’s conveniently close to the Rochdale tram stop and local shops. The building has a rich history dating back to the 1700s, having served various purposes over the years, including as a school and a police meeting place before its time as a hotel.
