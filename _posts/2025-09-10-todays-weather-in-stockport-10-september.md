Stockport's weather on Wednesday is looking quite changeable with a definite chance of rain. Expect mild temps around 18°C high and 13°C low, but with a 100% chance of rain, it’s best to gear up for a wet day. Morning will start with a hint of sunshine, but clouds will roll in, bringing steady showers by afternoon. Humidity will make it feel muggy, so layering is a good idea. Winds from the southwest at 20 mph will add a chill, especially in exposed areas. 

For commuters, plan for potential delays during rush hours due to the rain and slick roads. Keep an umbrella and waterproof gear handy, and maybe consider indoor plans when the downpours hit hardest. Finally, secure any loose outdoor items with those gusty winds in play. While the weather’s not ideal, a bit of prep can help keep your day on track!
