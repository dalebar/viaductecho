In Stockport today, expect a mix of clouds and rain, with temperatures ranging from 13°C to 18°C. There’s a 100% chance of rain, so prepare for wet conditions, particularly in the afternoon when it’ll likely be at its heaviest. Humidity will be around 77%, making it feel a bit muggy, and brisk winds from the southwest at 20 mph will add a chill. 

For commuters, expect delays, particularly during rush hours due to the rain. It's a good idea to leave extra time for your journey and be cautious on wet roads. If you’re heading out, don’t forget your umbrella and wear waterproof gear. Indoor activities are a smart choice during the heaviest downpours. As for outdoor items, secure anything loose, and be mindful of your surroundings in the wind. While it’s not the brightest weather, a bit of preparation will help keep your day running smoothly!
