The massive ice rink in Manchester city centre is back, but this year it’s got a twist—gone is the festive Christmas tree, replaced by a 15-metre wind turbine, thanks to a partnership with Octopus Energy. This innovative feature generates about 7% of the rink's power, marking a step towards greener, sustainable celebrations. Plus, there's a giant snow globe nearby with a charming alpine scene for a fun photo op! For Octopus customers, there's a two-for-one ticket offer. 

The rink opened initially as Scare Skate for Halloween and will run fully festive until January 4. Various sessions are available, with prices starting from £17.50 for adults and £13.75 for children. There’s a new Caffè Nero pit stop for warming drinks and a VIP fast-track entry option, too. With the idea of making Manchester's events greener, Councillor Tracey Rawlins emphasised the city's commitment to becoming a zero-carbon city. Skates can be rented for £5. Grab your tickets online and enjoy the festive fun!
