A fundraiser has been launched in memory of Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, one of the teenagers who tragically died in a car collision in Bolton on January 11, 2026. The crash claimed the lives of four men when a red Seat Leon collided with a Citroen taxi. Mairaj Mukhtar, Mohammed's brother, started the crowdfunding effort aiming to create an essential community resource, raising over £7,000 of its £10,000 goal. The campaign focuses on establishing a charitable well in Mohammed's name, promoting ongoing acts of charity. Many heartfelt tributes have poured in from donors, praising his character and kindness. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police are investigating the incident and have urged the public to refrain from sharing footage that could impact the affected families. They are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward to assist in their investigation.
