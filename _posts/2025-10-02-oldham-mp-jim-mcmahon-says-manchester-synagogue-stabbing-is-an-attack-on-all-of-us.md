Oldham MP Jim McMahon has condemned a stabbing incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in north Manchester, which left two dead and three seriously injured. He called it "an attack on all of us,” especially on such a significant holy day for the Jewish community. Emergency services, praised for their quick action, responded swiftly after a member of the public alerted them. Greater Manchester Police recognised the shock this incident has caused and are maintaining communication with local synagogues for support. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the attack as "absolutely shocking" and announced that an emergency Cobra meeting would be held, with extra police deployed to synagogues across the UK. He also expressed his gratitude for the emergency services' rapid response.
