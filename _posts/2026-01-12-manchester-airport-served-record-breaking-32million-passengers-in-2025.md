Manchester Airport hit a record-breaking 32 million passengers in 2025, marking a 4% increase from the previous year, solidifying its place as the UK's third-largest airport. December was the busiest month ever, with nearly 2.4 million passengers and over a million travelling during the Christmas period alone. Fortunately, most passengers enjoyed a smooth experience, with 94% waiting 10 minutes or less at security.

The majority of travellers used the new £1.3 billion Terminal 2, which recently opened key features like a route to a World Duty Free store and a Boutique Mall with luxury shops. New eateries, including WHSmith and Costa, launched in the arrivals area, with more exciting additions on the way, such as the Great Northern Market and Manchester Airport’s first Wetherspoon’s.

Plans for Terminal 1’s closure later this year aim to expand Terminal 3, which is also undergoing multi-million pound improvements. Managing Director Chris Woodroofe expressed pride in the airport's achievements and the focus on enhancing passenger experience for an even busier 2026.
