Robbie Williams is set to perform an intimate gig in Manchester on 27 February as part of Brits Week, which is a series of concerts benefiting War Child. He'll take the stage at Aviva Studios, joined by indie pop band Lottery Winners and fellow artist Olivia Dean, ahead of the Brit Awards. Expect to hear tracks from his latest album, *Britpop*, and hits from his debut, *Life Thru A Lens*. Williams recently wrapped up a string of smaller shows in UK cities, and fans are buzzing about his upcoming performance. War Child's Clare Sanders-Wright expressed excitement for the event and gratitude to all involved. Tickets for Robbie's concert go on sale Friday at 10:00 GMT, with a pre-sale available Thursday at the same time. Proceeds from the concerts will support War Child's efforts to aid children affected by war, providing education, mental health support, and more.
