A furniture shop worker, Amar Hussein, faces terrorism charges related to a suspected plot against Jewish communities in Manchester. His defence claims prosecutors haven't proved their case, arguing Hussein is a "foolish and unsophisticated man" who holds "abhorrent" views but isn't guilty of terrorism. Prosecutors allege he participated in reconnaissance for a potential attack and was involved in plans to smuggle firearms, alongside co-defendant Walid Saadaoui. Saadaoui, arrested with weapons, claims he was coerced into participation and planned to sabotage the plot. Both deny charges of preparing terrorist acts from late 2023 to May 2024. 

Hussein's lawyer, Danny Robinson KC, cited the prosecution's failure to meet the burden of proof, emphasising that jurors should find him not guilty if there's even a reasonable doubt. He highlighted key moments that suggest Hussein had limited knowledge of discussions and plans. Bilel Saadaoui, Walid’s brother, is also charged but his defence argues he lacked knowledge of the alleged conspiracy. The trial is ongoing at Preston Crown Court.
