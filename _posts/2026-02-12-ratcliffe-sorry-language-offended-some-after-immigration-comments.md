Sir Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, has apologised for offending people with his comments about the UK being "colonised by immigrants." His remarks sparked criticism, notably from Sir Keir Starmer, who called them "offensive and wrong." Ratcliffe acknowledged his language could have been better and emphasised the need for controlled immigration to support economic growth. The club stated its commitment to inclusivity, reflecting Manchester's diverse heritage. 

The FA is reportedly looking into whether Ratcliffe's comments bring the game into disrepute, which could lead to further consequences. His comments, particularly about the economy and population statistics, were met with backlash from various quarters, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who argued such sentiments contradict Manchester's values, and anti-discrimination groups that labelled his words as divisive. Ratcliffe, previously a supporter of Brexit, is now backing Labour as he distances himself from the Conservative Party ahead of the next general election.
