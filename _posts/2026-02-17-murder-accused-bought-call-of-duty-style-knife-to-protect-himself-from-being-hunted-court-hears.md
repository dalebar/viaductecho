In a Manchester Crown Court trial, 19-year-old Abbas Hussain is accused of murdering fellow 19-year-old Mohammed Isa Afzal during a brawl at a five-a-side football venue in Bury last August. Hussain, along with co-defendants Mohammed Rayhan and Biryan Ak, all deny the murder charges. The court heard that Afzal was initially following Hussain's car, allegedly intending to confront him over previous disputes. When they met, Afzal wielded a baseball bat, while Hussain claimed he had a hunting knife for self-protection, feeling intimidated by prior incidents involving Afzal. Witnesses described the knife as a "zombie style" weapon. During the confrontation, Hussain allegedly stabbed Afzal, who later died from multiple injuries. Hussain expressed remorse over Afzal's death, stating it was never his intention for things to escalate so violently. The trial is ongoing, with all three defendants maintaining their innocence regarding the murder charges.
