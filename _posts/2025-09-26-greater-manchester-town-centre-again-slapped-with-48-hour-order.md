Wigan town centre is under another dispersal order from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour. This is the fourth order in recent weeks, effective from 3pm today until 3pm Sunday. The decision follows rising reports of groups causing harassment and distress to residents and businesses. The order, allowed under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act, gives police the power to remove those likely to cause trouble from the area. Neighbourhood Inspector Lisa Morris highlighted the positive impact of these orders and mentioned that parents of offending youths will be contacted. For reporting anti-social behaviour, people can call GMP on 101 or use their Live Chat, while emergencies should go through 999. You can also reach out to Crimestoppers anonymously.
