The second victim of a plane crash near Rochdale has been named as 39-year-old Mustafa Qays Obadey from Greenford, London. His family described him as "humble and kind", saying he was the "glue of the family and community." The tragic incident occurred on February 3, shortly after 11am, when a private light aircraft crashed on moorland near Blackstone Edge. The other victim, Arian Abbasi, 36, was remembered as a "deeply loving father and devoted husband" who was about to start his new career as a commercial airline pilot. Investigations by Greater Manchester Police and the Air Accident Investigation Branch are ongoing, with all lines of inquiry still open, including an issue related to the aircraft's parachute deployment. Witnesses or anyone with information about the crash are urged to contact GMP, quoting log number 1056 of February 3, 2026.
