A man was attacked by two people in Bolton town centre on January 17. Police cordoned off part of Bradshawgate after responding to reports of the assault at 5.50am. The 18-year-old victim was taken to hospital with a serious head injury, but he is recovering well. Two suspects were arrested: a 17-year-old boy and a 30-year-old man, both on suspicion of assault. They've since been released on bail while further investigations continue. Eyewitnesses noted that CCTV footage captured the moment one man was punched and then assaulted again while on the ground. Forensic teams gathered evidence from the scene, where blood had been found, before it was cleared away.
