The family of 15-year-old Mohanad Abdullaahi Goobe, fatally stabbed after school in south Manchester, are heartbroken and have paid a touching tribute to him. They shared how difficult it is to believe that the last time they saw him was when he left for school. Mohanad was remembered as the “baby of the family,” who had a contagious laugh and loved making others smile. His family expressed the need to remember him for the love he brought into their lives rather than as another victim of knife crime. They vowed to ensure his name isn't lost in statistics and urged others to think of him fondly. Meanwhile, a murder investigation is underway, with a 15-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murder, and police are seeking witnesses or any footage related to the incident. Information can be shared with Greater Manchester Police or through Crimestoppers.
