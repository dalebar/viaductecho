Greater Manchester Police is boosting their presence in Manchester's Jewish communities and near places of worship after a tragic terrorist attack in Bondi Beach during a Hanukkah celebration, which left 16 dead and 42 injured. The incident happened on December 14, involving two gunmen, identified as father and son, with one being from Sydney. This comes after another attack at Heaton Park Synagogue on Yom Kippur, where two worshippers lost their lives. Assistant Chief Constable John Webster addressed the community, emphasising the importance of increased police presence during Hanukkah and acknowledging the recent fears and frustrations. He reassured the Jewish community that extra patrols, including armed officers, will be on duty to ensure safety and encourage open communication with the police about any concerns. He noted that recent events have heightened anxiety, particularly for those connected to past incidents. The aim is to allow the community to celebrate Hanukkah peacefully and feel secure.
