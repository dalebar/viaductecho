A survivor of abuse has spent six years fighting for justice, feeling let down by the criminal justice system. Now that her abusers are convicted, she reflects on the toll it’s taken on her, especially the time lost with her daughter. The process has been emotionally draining, leaving her feeling “broken” and “exhausted.” She calls for change, urging police and courts to acknowledge survivors as real people deserving of compassion and support, rather than just numbers in a system. 

The St Mary’s Sexual Abuse Referral Centre, which has supported survivors for 40 years, echoes her concerns regarding delays in the justice process, with clients now waiting longer for resolution. The government's Victims' Minister, Alex Davies-Jones, acknowledges systemic failings and pledges commitment to reform, highlighting substantial funding for victim support services. She emphasises the need for direct engagement with survivors to inform meaningful change, stating the system needs to prioritise their needs and experiences to restore trust and support.
