Tony Aspinall shares his childhood accident from trying to make a musket, which led to losing his arm and three months in hospital. At 66, he’s being fitted with a new prosthesis that will enhance his ability as a musician in his family's long-running music business. The Specialised Ability Centre in Wythenshawe, Manchester, is crucial for thousands dealing with limb loss. It offers a ‘cradle to grave’ service, providing counselling, physiotherapy, and tailored prosthetic devices for people with limb differences. The centre has seen an increase in patients since the pandemic, particularly among young people with diabetes. Staff like physiotherapist Sophie Racz emphasize the importance of getting people moving post-amputation for better recovery. Patients, like Gwyn Williams and Eamonn Swayah, express challenges and triumphs, navigating life with their prosthetics. The team blends technical skills and compassion, helping those recovering regain independence and tackle societal misconceptions about disability. Despite the hurdles, many find hope and resilience through the support they receive.
