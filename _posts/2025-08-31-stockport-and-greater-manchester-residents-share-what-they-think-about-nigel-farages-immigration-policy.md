Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, recently unveiled plans to deport up to 600,000 migrants in five years, with a proposed cost of Â£10 billion. According to the Home Office, the number of asylum seekers in hotels has risen under Labour, now hitting over 32,000. Farage's proposal, called 'operation restoring justice', requires significant policy changes, including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights.

A recent poll showed Reform gaining an eight-point lead, prompting opinions from 64 Greater Manchester residents. Many support curbing immigration but are skeptical of Farage. While some, like pensioners Shirley and Sue, express strong support for his stance on immigration, others, like retired nurse Sandra, think his methods are impractical. Concerns around the treatment of asylum seekers were raised by workers like Vicky, who argue against sending vulnerable individuals back to unsafe countries.

Many respondents feel disillusioned with all political leaders, reflecting wider frustrations about pressing issues like healthcare and the cost of living. The prevailing sentiment is that while immigration is a hot topic, broader discontent with the government is driving the conversation.
