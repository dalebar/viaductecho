Leanne Quigley, the winner of BBC's Traitors, is calling on folks in Manchester to join Cancer Research UK's Race for Life after her recent experience with the event. Leanne and her fiancé, Sophie, took part in a Pretty Muddy challenge last summer, raising over £1,200 for cancer research following Sophie's breast cancer diagnosis in 2024. Now in remission, Sophie is back at work, and they’re planning their wedding while celebrating their twin boys turning three. Leanne emphasises the importance of community support during tough times and is encouraging everyone to sign up for the upcoming events in Manchester, Stockport, Wigan, and Tatton Park. Whether you want to walk, jog, or run, there's something for everyone, and it's a non-competitive atmosphere. The aim? To unite against cancer and support lifesaving research together. Join in, bring your mates, and help make a difference!
