Aer Lingus has announced it will cease long-haul services from Manchester Airport, effective March 31, 2026. This decision follows ongoing pay disputes and underperformance compared to its Irish operations. The airline's Manchester routes to New York, Orlando, and Barbados are affected, though short-haul flights to Dublin and Belfast remain. Over 200 staff, including 150 cabin crew, face redundancy as part of the closure. 

This move comes amid a decline in demand for US travel, with holidaymakers opting for destinations like Mauritius instead. Rival Virgin Atlantic plans to expand its offerings to Orlando, indicating they anticipated this shift. 

Travel experts suggest possible future routes to cities like Boston and Chicago might emerge, particularly with the new Airbus A321 XLR aircraft, which could facilitate more flexible flight options. Manchester Airport continues to explore new destinations, while VisitBritain is promoting the region to draw US tourists, anticipating increased visitor spending in the coming years.
