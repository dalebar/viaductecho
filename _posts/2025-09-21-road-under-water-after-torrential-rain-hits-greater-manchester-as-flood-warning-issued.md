A street in Peel Green Road, Salford, has been completely flooded, causing major issues for residents. Many homes have water damage, and cars are submerged after heavy rains and a Met Office yellow weather warning was issued across Greater Manchester. One resident, who’s on holiday in Turkey, described how her son, without a full licence, is struggling to save her car while wading through the water. Another local, Wangtshuk Bhotia, mentioned that although his house hasn’t been affected, his garden is now underwater. The flood alerts extend beyond Salford, affecting various areas including the River Irwell and River Mersey in the city. The Met Office warns that there’s a small chance of further flooding, with the warning in place from Saturday morning until Sunday early hours. The situation reflects increasing concerns over flooding in the area, especially since road re-tarmacking a few years prior.
