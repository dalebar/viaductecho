This week in Manchester, two terrorists, Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein, received life sentences for planning an Islamic State-inspired attack aimed at Jewish people, intending to strike during a pro-Israel march in 2024. Their plot involved smuggling firearms into the UK, with Saadaoui ordered to serve a minimum of 37 years and Hussein 26 years. Meanwhile, a mother and father were jailed for the abuse and death of their two-year-old daughter, Omra Wali Jan, who suffered horrific injuries over weeks; the mother pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 

In a separate case, nurse Acheema Cherian was nearly killed by a patient, Romon Haque, who attacked her in a hospital “revenge” stabbing. Haque received an extended sentence after being convicted of attempted murder. Additionally, concierge Mohmand Ahmadyar-Khan was assaulted by a group of youths, leading to one attacker being sentenced to two years in prison. Lastly, Myra Shabab, a former criminology graduate and prison officer, almost faced jail time herself after attempting to smuggle drugs into HMP Manchester.
