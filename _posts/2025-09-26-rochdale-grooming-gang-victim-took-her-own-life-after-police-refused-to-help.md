Charlotte Tetley, a victim of the Rochdale grooming gang, tragically took her own life by stepping in front of a train in September 2024. A coroner revealed that both the police and NHS failed her in the weeks leading up to her death. Despite reporting suicidal feelings multiple times, she was discharged from a mental health inpatient bed list without a proper review and after consistent documentation recommending her admission. On two occasions, police ignored urgent alerts about her risk, claiming they would only intervene if she explicitly stated an intent to end her life. After her death, the coroner emphasised the need for better protocols, arguing that strict interpretations of policy could lead to future tragedies. Both Cheshire Police and the NHS Trust have been urged to respond to the coroner's concerns by November 9, with action needed to prevent similar situations in the future. Charlotte's case highlights serious gaps in support for vulnerable individuals navigating mental health crises.
