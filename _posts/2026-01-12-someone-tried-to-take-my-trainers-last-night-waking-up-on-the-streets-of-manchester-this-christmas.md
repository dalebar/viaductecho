On Christmas morning in Manchester City Centre, 40-year-old Darren Ginge finds himself awake at the Arndale, despite having a flat in Middleton that he can't access due to a neighbour dispute. He reflects on his rough nights, having previously been homeless for seven years, but appreciates the kindness he's received in the form of food and gifts of chocolates and a coat. Meanwhile, 39-year-old Rebecca Weston, originally from Wigan, shares her struggles of homelessness following domestic abuse, having slept in a box last night. She’s grateful for the warm essentials she received and pleads for kindness rather than judgment from others. Shivering in the cold, Michael Bruce from Salford also shares his tough situation under a bridge, expressing his grief over losing his daughter in 2018. Despite his hardships, he maintains faith and notes the generosity of the community, especially during the festive season. This slice of life highlights the resilience and humanity of those facing homelessness in the bustling city during Christmas.
