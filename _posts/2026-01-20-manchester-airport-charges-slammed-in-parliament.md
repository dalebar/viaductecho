Jim McMahon MP has voiced his concerns in parliament over Manchester Airport's steep drop-off charges, calling them 'unfair' and 'unreasonable'. During a debate, he highlighted the confusing signages, high fees for short stays, and inadequate payment methods that can lead to hefty penalties for drivers who exceed their time limit. Currently, it costs £5 for a five-minute drop-off, rising to £25 for 30 minutes, with a potential £100 fine for overshooting just a minute. McMahon argues that this system disproportionately affects low-wage workers, stressing that the airport shouldn’t raise prices like Gatwick did. He also suggested a more straightforward payment method, like a 'tap-in' system, for convenience. Previous criticisms have come from other MPs as well, who have labelled the new drop-off system as confusing and potentially exploitative. Manchester Airport defended the charges as necessary for traffic management and noted that using their JetParks One drop-off area remains free. They claim their rates are competitive compared to similar airports.
