Manchester Airport has been named one of the world’s most stressful airports in 2025, ranking alongside Newark and JFK in a study by iSelect. Researchers evaluated 50 airports based on flight delays, cancellations, and passenger experiences from reviews on FlightRadar24. Despite scoring poorly in baggage claim, security, and check-in, Manchester managed a low cancellation rate of 1.18%. It received a score of 23.10 out of 100, better than Newark's 18.46, but lagging behind London Heathrow and Gatwick. Manchester Airport responded by citing its own passenger surveys, revealing over 90% rated their experience positively. They've invested £1.3 billion in upgrading Terminal 2, which has enhanced efficiency, shown by quicker security wait times. The study also highlighted the least stressful airports, which included Singapore Changi, Hamad in Doha, and Incheon in Seoul.
