Emma Laycock, a resident in Stockport, is struggling with a flea infestation in the communal garden outside her flat, affecting her ability to enjoy the space with her dog, Buster. Despite reporting the issue to Stockport Homes, the social housing provider, Emma claims no effective action has been taken. She’s faced with frequent flea treatments costing her £26 a month and says she often gets bitten herself. Emma feels let down by the system, stating that other pet owners in the area are facing similar problems, and she hasn’t seen a housing officer in five years. Stockport Homes acknowledged her concerns and mentioned they’re actively working to address the situation with pest control and ongoing monitoring, although they note that tackling fleas outdoors can be challenging. Emma just wants a solution so she can enjoy her garden.
