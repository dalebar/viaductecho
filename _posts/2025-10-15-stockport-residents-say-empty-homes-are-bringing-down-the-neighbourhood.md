Residents in Stockport are urging action on empty homes they believe are ruining local neighbourhoods. John and Pam Matuszczak, who live near a long-unoccupied house in Cheadle Hulme, highlighted the property's poor state and its negative impact on the area. Stockport Council is considering using compulsory purchase powers on six such homes due to their dilapidated conditions and failure to improve despite previous efforts with the owners. Council leader Mark Roberts acknowledged the importance of this approach to reclaim vacant properties for housing. The plan, set to be discussed by the council on October 16, aims to renovate and reoccupy these homes, contributing to alleviating the housing shortage, with over 9,000 households currently on the social housing waiting list. However, there are calls for a more comprehensive ongoing strategy, as six properties wonâ€™t solve the wider housing crisis. Local opposition leader Christine Carrigan emphasised the need for a long-term commitment to tackle the issue effectively, ensuring the renovated homes remain affordable.
