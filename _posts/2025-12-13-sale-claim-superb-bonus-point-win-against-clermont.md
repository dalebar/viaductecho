Sale Sharks bagged a fantastic bonus-point win over Clermont Auvergne, boosting their chances to qualify from Pool One in the Investec Champions Cup. With two wins out of four matches, they’re looking good as historically that has been enough to reach the knockout stages. The next matches in January see Sale taking on South African side Sharks at home before heading to Toulouse to wrap up the pool phase. The Clermont Auvergne line-up included players like Guillaud, Fall and Raka, while the match was officiated by Italian referee Gianluca Gnecchi. Fingers crossed for Sale to keep the momentum going!
