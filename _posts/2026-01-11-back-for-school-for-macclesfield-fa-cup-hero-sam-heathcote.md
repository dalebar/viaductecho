Sam Heathcote, defender for Macclesfield, made headlines after helping secure an incredible 2-1 FA Cup upset against holders Crystal Palace. Macclesfield became the first non-league side to defeat the Cup holders since 1909, with key goals from captain Paul Dawson and Isaac Buckley-Ricketts. Despite a late rally from Palace, the part-time Macclesfield players showed great tenacity. After this monumental win, Heathcote, who’s also a PE teacher at Stamford Park Primary School, is heading back to work with a big grin. His students had cheeky instructions for him before the match—chiefly, don’t mess up! Dawson's spirited performance was filled with heart, even getting a head wound but pushing through. The club’s strong community bond has been essential, especially after coping with the tragic loss of young forward Ethan McLeod. Heathcote noted that their success was a tribute to him, showcasing the special camaraderie at the club. Overall, it’s a blend of sport and spirit, with a true sense of togetherness.
