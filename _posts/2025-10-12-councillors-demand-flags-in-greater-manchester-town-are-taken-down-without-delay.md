Labour councillors in Stockport, Jon Byrne and Claire Vibert, are pushing to remove England flags and Union Jacks from lamp-posts, citing community concerns about possible racism disguised as patriotism. At a council meeting, Byrne highlighted residents' distress over the flags and urged for their immediate removal, while Vibert supported this stance, emphasising the importance of not tolerating intimidation. The council, led by the Lib Dems, stated that flags will stay unless they pose a safety risk or become damaged. Council leader Mark Roberts noted the complex situation regarding community tensions and the ongoing discussions with partners on how best to handle protest flags. For now, flags remain, but the council is monitoring the situation to ensure safety and address any issues as they arise.
