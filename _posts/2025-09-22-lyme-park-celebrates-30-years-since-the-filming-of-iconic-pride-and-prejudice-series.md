This year marks 30 years since the BBC's beloved Pride and Prejudice series, filmed at Lyme Park, first aired. To celebrate, The National Trust is offering guided tours of Lyme Park, featuring exclusive access to filming locations like Darcy's Pond, usually closed to visitors this time of year. You can also check out a Regency dressing room and even dress up like Elizabeth or Mr Darcy. The tours run until 22 October, with house admission needed but no extra booking required. Fans still regard the 1995 adaptation as the best, thanks to its detailed costumes, historical accuracy, and stunning scenery. Lyme Park itself has a rich history, evolving from a medieval hunting lodge to its current grand design. For more details on the tours, head over to their site.
