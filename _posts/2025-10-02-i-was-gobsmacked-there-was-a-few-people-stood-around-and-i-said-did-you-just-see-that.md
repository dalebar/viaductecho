A passenger at Manchester Airport's Terminal 1 spotted around a dozen mice scurrying about while waiting for his flight on September 25. The man, who chose to remain anonymous, described the experience as "absolutely vile," particularly as the rodents were seen mainly around the Starbucks kiosk late at night. He expressed concern about the mice being near food areas. In response, a Manchester Airport spokesperson assured that they strive to uphold high hygiene standards, implementing measures to deter pests, conducting regular checks, and advising the public to report any sightings. They explained that, due to the airport's location, it's not uncommon for mice to be attracted to the terminals.
