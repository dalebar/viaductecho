Anthony Groves, President of the Salford Lads and Girls Club and great-great-grandson of one of its founders, is gearing up for a massive 108-mile ultra marathon along the Pennine Way on January 10. This follows his remarkable 55-mile run last December during Storm Darragh, which raised nearly £10,000 for the club. The upcoming challenge covers stunning landscapes and has a 60-hour completion limit, testing both physical and mental endurance. Anthony's run aims to support the long-established youth provision, founded in 1903, while also bringing him personal joy. He values the mental and physical benefits of running, seeing it as a way to tackle life's challenges. His goal for this run is to raise £10,000, with just over £5,600 collected so far. Donations are welcomed to support this worthy cause.
