Conditions at Stepping Hill Hospital are dire, with staff having to care for patients in crumbling buildings, according to Cheadle MP Tom Morrison. There's a pressing need for over £130 million in repairs, as the hospital, which serves 500,000 patients annually, faces serious structural issues. A council debate is set to discuss urgent funding for repairs, and Morrison has highlighted instances where nurses have had to move patients due to leaking ceilings. Despite receiving over £2.5 million for essential safety works this year, the hospital was overlooked for a restoration funding package. Local councillors are frustrated by MPs not visiting to witness the dire situation firsthand. They also urge for a new health and care centre and improved local NHS services. Meanwhile, the Department of Health acknowledges the need for reforms and funding to address these problems. Overall, the plea for investment and improvements at Stepping Hill is becoming increasingly critical.
