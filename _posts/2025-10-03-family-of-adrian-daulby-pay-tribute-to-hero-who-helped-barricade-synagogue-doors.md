Adrian Daulbyâ€™s family has paid heartfelt tribute to him after he died heroically during the Crumpsall synagogue attack. The 53-year-old helped barricade the doors when attacker Jihad Al-Shamie, armed with a knife, tried to enter. Tragically, Mr Daulby was accidentally shot by police during the incident. His family described him as a beloved brother and devoted uncle, emphasising his bravery and the shock of losing such a down-to-earth man. Greater Manchester Police acknowledged Adrian's courageous actions, noting that his injury may have stemmed from a tragic miscalculation by officers. More details about the incident include the killing of another victim, 66-year-old Melvin Cravitz, and the arrest of several individuals linked to the attack. Neighbours remember Adrian fondly, highlighting his kindness, love for nature, and strong ties to the community and synagogue. He was a cancer survivor, active in his local area, and adored by local children. His family is asking for privacy as they navigate their loss.
