Bolton Council has published a list of 220 streets that missed bin collections post-Christmas due to icy conditions, which has made access challenging for collection teams. They are aware of the missed bins and advise residents not to report them. Bin collections that were delayed include both waste and recyclables, particularly in areas like Beech Street and Eckersley Road, where multiple collection failures occurred. The council is working to address the missed pick-ups as quickly as possible, with a pledge to return within 48 hours for most areas. They’ve apologised for the disruption and remind residents that any excess waste can be taken to the nearest household waste recycling centre. An updated list of the affected streets is available on their website as of January 7, and the council encourages residents to check there for details.
