There's a lovely three-bedroom detached cottage up for grabs in Tottington, Bury, for £375,000, and it's got everyone buzzing in Greater Manchester. This charming home is set in a picturesque area, surrounded by countryside, and it’s chain-free to boot! With an average house price of around £280,538 in Tottington, this could be a fantastic deal. The place is a mix of rustic beauty and modern flair, featuring exposed stone walls, wooden beams, and an extended living space. You’ve got a cosy lounge with a log-burning fire, a snug (currently a playroom), and a spacious open-plan kitchen and dining area. Upstairs, there are three bedrooms and a family bathroom. The property also boasts generous gardens and a big driveway for parking. It’s known for its village charm and strong community vibe but remains close to Bury town centre. The listing has caused quite a stir on social media, with many potential buyers raving about its beauty. Sounds like a slice of dream life, doesn’t it?
