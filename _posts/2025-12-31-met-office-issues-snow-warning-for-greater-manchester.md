A yellow warning for snow and ice is in place for parts of the North West, including southern Greater Manchester, Trafford, South Manchester, and Stockport, lasting from midnight Thursday to midday Friday. Expect sleet and snow moving southeast, with 1 to 2 cm likely and up to 5 cm on higher ground. Icy patches are also a risk as the weather clears, potentially causing travel disruptions on roads and rail. The warning extends to areas in Cheshire, Chester, Halton, and Warrington, as well as parts of the East Midlands, East of England, London, South East, South West, and West Midlands. For Thursday, after some showery rain, brighter spells are expected with a maximum temperature of 6C. Looking ahead to the weekend, Friday will bring sunshine, and while it will be mostly dry, scattered wintry showers may occur with frost and ice overnight. No further warnings are anticipated for the weekend in the North West, but Scotland has a yellow warning on Saturday.
