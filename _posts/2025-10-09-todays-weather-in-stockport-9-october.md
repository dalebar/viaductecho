Stockport’s weather on Thursday looks quite dreary, with a cloudy sky and early morning rain. Expect temperatures to hover between 11°C and 15°C, making it a mild but damp day. Rain is set to pour down in the morning with a 100% chance, easing off later but leaving the clouds hanging around. Humidity will be high at 87%, which might feel a bit muggy, while a gentle breeze at 13 mph could make things feel fresher.

If you’re commuting, be prepared for wet and slippery conditions, so don’t forget your umbrella and waterproof jacket. It’s wise to allow extra time for any delays on the roads. Given the weather, it's a good day for indoor activities, so think about keeping your plans flexible if you’re considering being outside. Stay comfortable and dry at home or work, and keep that umbrella handy if you head out!
