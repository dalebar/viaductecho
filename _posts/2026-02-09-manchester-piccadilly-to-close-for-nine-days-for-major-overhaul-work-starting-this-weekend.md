Manchester Piccadilly train station will close for nine days, from February 14 to February 22, for a major £7.9m overhaul aimed at improving passenger and freight journeys. The works include replacing points, renewing cabling, and upgrading sleeper tracks. During this time, no trains from the south or east will arrive at Piccadilly, with services terminating at Stockport instead. Despite the station closure, the concourse will remain open, offering a limited service from platforms 13 and 14. Staff will assist with coordinating bus and Metrolink journeys as alternative travel options. Various train services will be impacted across the region, and passengers are advised to travel light and allow extra time for their journeys due to expected busyness. Network Rail is working with local authorities to ensure smooth travel for around 400,000 trains that rely on this route each year.
