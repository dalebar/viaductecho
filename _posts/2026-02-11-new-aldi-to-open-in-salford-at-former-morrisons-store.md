A new Aldi is set to open later this year at the former Morrisons site on Trafford Road, benefiting the Ordsall and Salford Quays areas. After a decade of vacancy, Aldi is ready to revamp the 50,000 sq ft space and has started putting up its branding. The existing Radclyffe Park complex, which includes shops and leisure facilities, will support the new store, offering around 297 parking spaces. There were initial plans for Pure Gym to join Aldi, but confirmation is pending. Local councillor Brendan Keville emphasised the positive impact on local jobs and community access to affordable food. With major regeneration projects on the way, including over 3,000 new homes in the area, both Salford Quays and Ordsall are gearing up for growth. Aldi expressed excitement about serving the local residents, anticipating welcoming customers soon.
