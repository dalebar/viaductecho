Stockport train station is set for a major redevelopment backed by over £4m in government funding. This project aims to improve access and facilities at the station which serves the busy West Coast Main Line. Local MP Navendu Mishra and Edgeley councillors have raised concerns about the station’s current state, sparking calls for investment to make it a source of pride for residents. Planned upgrades include better pedestrian connections, a new shortcut ramp from Thompson Street, and enhanced platform services. The council, in partnership with Transport for Greater Manchester, Network Rail, and Avanti, sees this redevelopment as a significant opportunity for job growth and improved connectivity in Stockport. The station’s renovation is part of a broader £1bn regeneration effort in the town centre, which includes new transport facilities, housing, and shopping spaces.
