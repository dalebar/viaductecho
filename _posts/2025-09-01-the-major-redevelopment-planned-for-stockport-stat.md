Big changes are coming to Stockport train station, with a major redevelopment kickstarted by over £4m in government funding. The aim is to enhance accessibility and overall use of the busy hub connecting Manchester and London. This comes after local MP Navendu Mishra and councillors raised concerns about the station's condition. Proposed improvements include better pedestrian connections, a new ramp from Thompson Street, and upgraded platforms for commuters.

The council is working with key partners like Transport for Greater Manchester and Network Rail to make it happen. Stockport council leader Mark Roberts highlighted the importance of showcasing the station’s potential on Europe’s busiest rail line, emphasising that this project is about jobs, investment, and boosting connectivity. 

The station redevelopment is part of a wider £1bn regeneration scheme in Stockport, which involves a new transport interchange and plans for thousands of homes and commercial spaces. Exciting times ahead for Stockport residents!
