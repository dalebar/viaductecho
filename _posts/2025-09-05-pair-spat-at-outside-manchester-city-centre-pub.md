Police in Manchester are looking for two individuals—a male and female—who were allegedly spat at outside the City Arms pub on Kennedy Street. After reports of an aggressive male, a suspect was arrested. However, officers still need to hear from the victims to proceed with the case. A spokesperson from Greater Manchester Police is urging them to come forward for further action. If you were at the pub on September 4 and are one of the victims, reach out to GMP at 03351@gmp.police.uk.
