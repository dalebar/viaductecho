The Prime Minister shared that he realised the left's stance on immigration was flawed after a visit to Oldham nearly ten years ago. In an interview with BBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg ahead of the Labour conference, Sir Keir Starmer was pressed on his recent comments about illegal immigration. He stated he’s believed for some time that the left was mistaken. When asked why it took so long, he mentioned hearing concerns from locals in Oldham. Starmer pointed out that the Labour government, which he leads, has only been in power for a year, following years in opposition. He highlighted recent actions to improve law enforcement and tackle illegal immigration, claiming nearly 35,000 immigrants have been returned—the highest in a decade. He expressed a desire to reduce the use of asylum hotels and empathised with public frustration on the issue. During the chat, he also criticised Reform UK for undermining the values of a diverse and tolerant society. The interview occurred in Liverpool amid the Labour conference buzz.
