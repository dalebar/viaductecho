A brand-new £27 million college campus has opened in Stockport, specifically for Cheadle College. The state-of-the-art facilities on Cheadle Road include dedicated areas for A-Levels and T-Levels, a clinical ward, science labs, and even a virtual nursery. There’s also support for students with Special Educational Needs, along with fresh garden and sports facilities. With government funding of £20 million and an additional £7 million from the Trafford and Stockport College Group, the campus aims to elevate education for young people in Stockport and Greater Manchester. CEO James Scott highlighted the project as a significant step forward, emphasising the importance of high-quality resources for students. Stockport Council's Coun Wendy Meikle echoed this, stating the campus is crucial for providing a top-notch education and fostering growth in the borough. Construction firm Wilmott Dixon managed the building process, employing numerous local apprentices and deliberately spending £9 million within a 20-mile radius. Overall, this new campus is set to inspire and empower the next generation of learners in the area.
