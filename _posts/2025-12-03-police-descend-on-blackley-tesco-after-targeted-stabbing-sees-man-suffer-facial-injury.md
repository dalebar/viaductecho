Police were called to a Tesco Extra car park in Blackley, Greater Manchester, around 12:30pm after reports of a targeted stabbing. A man in his 30s was found with face injuries that aren't life-threatening and was taken to hospital. The police have assured the public there’s no ongoing risk, as they believe it was a targeted incident, with investigations still in progress and no arrests made yet. Officers cordoned off the area, and several police vehicles were on-site throughout the afternoon while inquiries were conducted. The supermarket temporarily closed during this time.
