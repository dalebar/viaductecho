A dispersal order is now active in Hindley after reports of kids causing anti-social behaviour, including throwing items at cars and alcohol-related disturbances. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) received eight complaints and have implemented a 48-hour order that lasts until 3pm on Monday, September 29. Under this order, officers can exclude individuals from the area for up to two days. Thereâ€™s also a similar dispersal order in Wigan town centre, active for the fourth time recently due to similar issues. Inspector Adam James noted an increase in anti-social behaviour in both Hindley and Wigan, stating that this order aims to prevent further incidents and reassure residents. Officers will be patrolling the area to enforce the order and engage with locals.
