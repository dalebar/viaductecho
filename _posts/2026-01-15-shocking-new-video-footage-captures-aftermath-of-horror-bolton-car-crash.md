Tragic footage has emerged from the scene of a horrific car crash in Bolton that claimed the lives of three teenagers—Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, Farhan Patel, and Mohammed Danyaal—and a taxi driver, Masrob Ali. The accident occurred on Wigan Road, with the crash involving a Seat Leon and a Citroen C4 Picasso. Five others were injured, including a woman in the taxi with life-threatening injuries. Eyewitnesses reported a chaotic scene with emergency services responding rapidly. A concerning video, part of the investigation, shows a car speeding over 120mph in the same area just a day before the crash, believed to be filmed by someone in the Seat Leon. Local residents expressed their shock and called for better education on safe driving for young people, emphasising that it’s crucial to ensure new drivers know the dangers of powerful cars. They stressed that young drivers need more guidance and that we must protect our communities from such tragedies.
