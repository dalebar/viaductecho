This week, Andy Burnham's office faced complications over the controversial Places for Everyone development plan, which has been in the spotlight for over a decade. Originally approved by nine Greater Manchester boroughs, the plan has long been contested, particularly regarding its impact on green belt land. Recently, inspectors were assessing how much land to designate as green belt, leading the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) to reduce the list of sites from 49 to 19 under a new legal test. This decision is being challenged in court, with campaigners arguing that it flawed the inspectors' judgement by imposing a higher standard. While the GMCA maintains that the legal changes were accepted, the ongoing legal battle means the saga isn’t over yet. The judge has yet to deliver a ruling, but it looks like Places for Everyone will continue to be a contentious issue, drawing out uncertainty for Burnham's office and the community. Even so, campaigners aren’t looking to overturn the plan but are seeking remedies for that legal omission, ensuring that the debate rumbles on.
