This Bonfire weekend, Salford's set for a brilliant celebration with free family-friendly events. Buile Hill Park kicks off on November 1 at 4pm, featuring various activities, including a fire walk and three firework displays – starting with the Little Sparks for younger kids, followed by a bigger one and the grand finale at 7:30pm. There’ll also be marshmallow toasting, a funfair, and plenty of food and drink to enjoy. Then on November 2, Prince’s Park in Irlam will host a traditional bonfire and more fireworks from 5pm, alongside its own funfair and refreshments. Coun Barbara Bentham expressed excitement about bringing back these safe, community-oriented events, encouraging everyone to bundle up and partake in the festivities. For those heading out, public transport is recommended, or you can book parking at Buile Hill Park for £5. Don't miss out on the full schedule for the weekend!
