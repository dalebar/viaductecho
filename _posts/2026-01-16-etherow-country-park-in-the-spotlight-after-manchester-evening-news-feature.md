Etherow Country Park in Stockport has been highlighted by the Manchester Evening News, showcasing its gorgeous 200 acres filled with woodland, grassland, and marshland, all crisscrossed by the River Etherow. The park's central lake is popular for sailing courses, while the weir and waterfall connect to the area’s industrial past. Visitors rave about the peaceful vibe, scenic walks, and diverse wildlife, making it a prime spot for leisurely strolls and photography. 

The park, originally part of a mill owner's estate, became one of England’s first country parks in the 1960s and remains a beloved retreat for locals and visitors alike. Cllr Grace Baynham expressed pride in the park and its role in promoting well-being and outdoor enjoyment. Etherow, along with Stockport's other parks, offers plenty for those seeking a tranquil escape or family time in nature.
