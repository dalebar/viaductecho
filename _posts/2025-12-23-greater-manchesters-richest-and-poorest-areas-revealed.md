There's a stark wealth divide in Greater Manchester, with rich areas like Salford Quays boasting an average annual disposable income of nearly £68,000, while struggling boroughs like Rumworth North in Bolton see just over £22,200. Within Manchester, Castlefield & Deansgate tops the income chart at £50,062, whereas Longsight East lags behind at £23,072, creating a £27,000 wage gap. The findings from the Office for National Statistics highlight how wealth is concentrated in city-centre and southern suburbs like Chorlton and Didsbury. Similar income disparities are observed across England and Wales, with Tower Hamlets' Leamouth area earning the highest at £107,600, against Birmingham's Sparkhill North's meagre £20,788. Overall, nearly half of London’s neighbourhoods rank in the top 10% for income, while areas in the North and Midlands face significant challenges, with many in the bottom 10%. To explore how your area compares, there's an interactive map for a deeper dive into local statistics.
