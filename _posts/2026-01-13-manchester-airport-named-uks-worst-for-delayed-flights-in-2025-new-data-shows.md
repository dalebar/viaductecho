Manchester Airport has been labelled the worst in the UK for flight delays, with a staggering 32% of flights impacted last year. Out of over 14 million passengers, nearly 4.7 million experienced delays or cancellations. While Birmingham and Bournemouth airports also faced significant disruptions, Manchester's airport claims the report is misleading, arguing that external factors like weather and airspace restrictions, particularly affecting long-haul flights, contributed to the issue. They highlighted that their extensive routes and the global context, including conflicts, increased average delay times. Also, the report noted Manchester to Cairo had the highest delay rates, whereas flights to Shanghai and Atlanta were among the most punctual. Manchester Airport stated that operational complexities should not excuse delays but stressed the importance of clear communication and passenger rights. Overall, the data indicates a challenging landscape for air travel, but there's been some improvement in long delays affecting only a small percentage of passengers.
