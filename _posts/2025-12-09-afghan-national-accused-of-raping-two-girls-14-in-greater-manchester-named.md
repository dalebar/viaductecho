A 28-year-old man, Sultani Bakatash, has been charged with raping two 14-year-old girls in Bolton. The alleged incident occurred at a flat in Middle Hulton early on December 7, prompting Greater Manchester Police to respond swiftly. Bakatash, an Afghan national, was arrested and now faces charges including two counts of rape of a minor, sexual assault, and assault by penetration. He’s been remanded in custody and is set to appear in court. The police are providing support to the girls and their families, while urging the public not to speculate about the case as it progresses through the legal system. They’re also seeking any relevant information to assist their investigation.
