Jennifer Cahill, a 34-year-old mother from Prestwich, tragically died following a home birth that was deemed "out of guidance." An inquest revealed she believed she was "low risk" for complications after her first birth, despite earlier issues, including significant blood loss. She suffered severe postpartum haemorrhage after giving birth to baby Agnes, who died four days later. Experts noted Mrs Cahill's situation was high risk, but a consultantâ€™s referral back to midwife care may have misled her into thinking otherwise.

Midwifery director Abigail Holmes highlighted the failure of healthcare providers to communicate the risks of a home birth effectively and the absence of necessary antenatal care planning. Basic monitoring during labour was also reportedly neglected, leading to a chaotic situation when both mother and baby faced complications. This raised concerns about the preparedness of the midwives and the overall care provided. The inquest continues, with critical discussions surrounding the lack of clear communication and the need for proper risk assessment in home births.
