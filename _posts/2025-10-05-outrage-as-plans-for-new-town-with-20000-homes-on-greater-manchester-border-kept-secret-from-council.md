Councillors are fuming over not being informed about plans for a massive new town near Adlington, Cheshire. The government has revealed proposals for 14,000 to 20,000 homes on around 970 hectares of greenfield land, but local councillors only found out when the sites were announced publicly. Cllr Michael Beanland expressed concerns over the lack of communication from Cheshire East Council, questioning who knew about it and why it was kept quiet. The new town aims to alleviate housing pressures in both Cheshire and Greater Manchester, boosting local economies. However, Cheshire Wildlife Trust is pushing back, highlighting the area's rich biodiversity and historical significance, arguing that such development could severely impact the environment. They advocate for sustainable housing in suitable locations instead. The situation has led to planned meetings between councillors and Cheshire East officers for further clarity.
