Luke Steele had a brush with Sir Alex Ferguson for being a bit too laid-back during training at Manchester United, where he joined in 2002. Before that, he kicked off at Peterborough United and later made a name at Barnsley, shining in a stunning FA Cup upset against Liverpool. Most recently, he’s been focused on YDP, the youth development programme he’s incredibly proud of, which now has franchises across several towns, including Peterborough and Cambridge. Interestingly, Steele has also dabbled as a striker earlier in his career, but now he’s the face of YDP, leading them through three promotions since the team’s inception just four years ago.
