The cost of living has shot up, especially at supermarkets, making it tricky to find the best deals. Since March 2022, a price comparison has been tracking eight essentials—like bread, milk, and coffee—across six major supermarkets. For the second consecutive week, Aldi tops the list as the cheapest, with a bill of £13.07, partly due to reduced coffee prices. Lidl follows closely at £13.18, while Asda is just behind at £13.19. Morrisons and Tesco come in at £13.65 and £13.77, respectively, with Sainsbury's being the most expensive at £13.80. Sainsbury's contests this comparison, arguing that it doesn't reflect the overall value of their offerings, while Aldi insists their products are higher quality. Both Aldi and Asda claim their budget ranges represent the best value, highlighting the ongoing supermarket price battle.
