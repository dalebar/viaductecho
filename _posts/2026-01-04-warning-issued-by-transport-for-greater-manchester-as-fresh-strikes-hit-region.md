Commuters should brace for some disruption as Bee Network staff at Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) are set to strike from Monday 5 December to Thursday 8 December. The action involves back-office staff represented by Unite and Unison, primarily over pay and parental leave issues. Thankfully, bus and tram drivers won't be striking, so services on those fronts will continue as usual. However, some interchange facilities with toilets and ticket offices might close. If you need to buy tickets during this time, it’s best to head to Altrincham, Bolton, Bury, Shudehill, or Wythenshawe interchanges. The Bee Network has advised passengers to plan accordingly.
