This Saturday in Stockport looks pretty overcast with cloudy skies and mild temperatures. You can expect it to hit around 12°C but feel a bit cooler due to a brisk wind at 17 mph and a humidity level of 77%. There's a 32% chance of light showers, so best to keep a close eye on the weather! 

If you're commuting, be prepared for potentially wet roads and reduced visibility, so drive carefully. Pedestrians might want to grab a waterproof jacket or an umbrella, and cyclists should brace for gusty winds.

To stay comfy, dress in layers to adjust between indoors and outdoors. While it’s not expected to rain heavily, a small brolly could be a handy companion. If you fancy some fun, maybe plan for some indoor activities or check out local spots where the dreary weather won’t spoil your day. Enjoy!
