Andy Burnham, born in Merseyside and now a key figure in Greater Manchester politics, has built a strong rapport with local voters over the years. Starting as the Labour MP for Leigh, he’s evolved into the Mayor of Greater Manchester since 2017, championing public transport reforms, notably through the ambitious Bee Network plan for an integrated transport system. His reputation as the "King of the North" emerged during his vocal opposition to the government during the pandemic, and he has consistently advocated for better rail services and support for local communities following tragedies like the Manchester Arena bombing. Despite facing challenges, including policing issues and controversies around grooming gangs and air quality, Burnham’s passion for Greater Manchester remains strong. With his recent announcement to contest the Gorton and Denton constituency and a potential future challenge to Keir Starmer for Labour leader, his political journey is far from over.
