Six men are on trial for allegedly sexually abusing three girls in Rochdale in horrific ways. The claims, mostly dating from the late '80s to the mid-2000s, involve serious allegations including rape and exploitation. The prosecutor described the girls as vulnerable due to troubled home lives, making them easy targets for the accused. The alleged ringleader, Tahir Rashid, is accused of abusing one girl multiple times and exposing her to sexually transmitted diseases, while others in the group also allegedly groomed and raped the girls. The girls were reportedly coerced into performing sexual acts in various locations, with no regard for their safety or well-being. Despite being known to social services, no effective action was taken to protect them at the time. Each defendant denies the charges, which range from multiple counts of rape to indecent assault. The trial is ongoing.
