A driver crashed into the Heywood Star takeaway on Bridge Street after being chased by police from Bury. Residents were shocked to find the scene of destruction after the crash early this morning. The Greater Manchester Police had responded to a disturbance, and during the pursuit, the vehicle collided with the takeaway, causing significant damage. The driver, a man in his 30s, has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and other charges and was taken to hospital for an arm injury. Bridge Street is currently closed as investigations continue and concerns about the building's safety arise, with council officials and diggers on-site for clean-up. Witnesses are encouraged to come forward with any information.
