Nexi the cat, a 13-year-old with a bit of a grump, became a hero when she scared off a burglar named Callum Quirk in Cheshire. While her owner hid in a wardrobe, Quirk had broken in through a downstairs window and was creeping closer to the bedroom. Just in time, Nexi darted into the hallway, hissing at Quirk, who promptly fled the scene without taking anything. CCTV footage caught him entering the house, and despite initially denying the break-in, DNA evidence linked him to the crime. PC Stuart Beswick highlighted the serious impact of burglary on victims and praised Nexi for her bravery. Quirk was sentenced to 35 months in jail after pleading guilty. The community of Halton can breathe a bit easier now.
