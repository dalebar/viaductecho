This weekend, Manchester’s Chinatown will come alive with the sounds of drums as thousands gather to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Leading the festivities is Master Chen, 50, from Altrincham, who's been part of this event since the late 1990s. He founded the Jinlong Culture & Performing Arts company in 1999, initially teaching Kung Fu. Over the years, his team has become a staple in the celebrations, performing the Lion Dance, Dragon Dance, and Wushu. This Saturday, they'll showcase the illuminated Night Dragon, and on Sunday, a stunning 180-metre-long blessing dragon will weave through the streets. Master Chen views these performances as a means to spread peace and blessings. He emphasises the importance of teamwork in making the dragon dance beautiful and engaging. With attendance reaching between 60,000 to 80,000 people, he feels proud to play a key role in fostering cultural understanding and celebration. This year’s festivities also include a visiting acrobatic troupe from Guizhou, China, enhancing the excitement. It’s a time for everyone to come together and share in joy and positive vibes!
