A TUI flight from Cancun to Manchester had to turn back over the Atlantic due to a medical emergency, causing chaos for hundreds of passengers. After landing in Gander, Canada, for an hour, the flight ended up diverted to Shannon Airport in Ireland because of crew restrictions. Passengers from Cancun spent over 24 hours waiting at Shannon, enduring cold conditions and long delays while dealing with technical issues. Stories emerged of frustrated travellers, including newly-weds who had just returned from their honeymoon bliss, now stuck in airport limbo. TUI acknowledged the issues, thanking their crew for their quick response to the medical situation, and explained that legal limits prevented them from flying directly to Manchester. They are arranging alternative flights and encouraging passengers to claim hotel costs and compensation for the inconvenience. Despite the difficulties, some passengers praised the staff at Shannon for their efforts in helping them.
