Armed officers cornered gunman Ethan Glasgow-Lattibeaudiere in Hulme after he shot two people and fled. The intense manhunt began after his daylight shooting on January 16, 2023. Glasgow-Lattibeaudiere was quickly identified by witnesses and let out of a friend’s flat late on January 17, where he was found hiding with a loaded revolver linked to the shooting, leading to his 16-year sentence for assault and firearms offences.

Greater Manchester Police's Force Critical Wanted Unit (FCWU) has had a busy year, making 130 arrests and addressing a rise in violent crime. High-profile cases included Rawal Rehman, who killed three-year-old Lulu in a reckless driving incident and was caught shortly after fleeing. The FCWU also tracked down the killers of Sadiq Al-Lami, relying on phone analysis and forensic evidence. 

Detective Supt Joe Harrop emphasised the unit’s commitment to public safety, valuing teamwork and swift action. Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson praised the team's exceptional professionalism and ability to handle the most dangerous criminals. The ongoing efforts demonstrate their dedication to maintaining safety in Greater Manchester.
