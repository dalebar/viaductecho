The plan to remove the 7am Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston train service has been scrapped after public outcry. Initially labelled as a 'ghost train', the weekday Avanti West Coast service was intended to run empty for staff transfer, raising concerns among local politicians, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who called the decision a misuse of public funds. Following significant pushback, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has reversed its decision, recognising the service's popularity despite acknowledging possible impacts on line reliability. Avanti West Coast expressed delight at the reinstatement, emphasising the train’s importance for quick travel between the two major cities. Network Rail also welcomed the change and assured support for its operation. Both Burnham and Rochdale MP Paul Waugh highlighted the need for improved rail connectivity for the region, urging that this should serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining essential services.
