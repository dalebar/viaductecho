Middleton's former town hall, Parkfield House, is set to be demolished to make way for 20 four-bedroom homes and an 80-bed care home. The planning committee approved the project in November 2025, and agreements with developer Muller Properties have now been finalised. Coun Carol Wardle noted that the brutalist building has become an 'eyesore' and the area needs more care facilities to meet increasing demand. The former town hall, empty since 2020 and prone to vandalism, will be replaced by a care home designed in a 'T' shape, complete with a 27-space car park and an outdoor garden area. The new homes will surround the care facility, each with private gardens and off-street parking, catering to the growing housing needs of older residents.
