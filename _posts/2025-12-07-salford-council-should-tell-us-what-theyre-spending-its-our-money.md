Salford residents are calling for greater transparency from the council regarding public spending on purchase cards after reports highlighted significant sums being used for taxis and hotels by senior councillors. Trust in the local government has dipped, with concerns about spending not being reported as expenses, which would typically be accessible to the public. A Conservative councillor emphasised the need for clear information on taxpayer money, while locals expressed frustration over the lack of openness, especially during the cost-of-living crisis.

Although Salford council asserts it aims for transparency and follows necessary regulations, critics argue that more detailed reporting on purchase card usage is needed. Mayor Paul Dennett defended the use of these cards for efficiency in council operations, citing beneficial projects funded through effective budgeting. Nonetheless, the council has only recently begun publishing purchase card figures and has not disclosed past spending, prompting calls for a shift towards more accessible financial reporting. Residents want assurance that their tax contributions are managed responsibly and openly.
