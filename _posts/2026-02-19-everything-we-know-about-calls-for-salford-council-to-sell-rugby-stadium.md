Salford Council is under pressure to sell the CorpAcq Stadium, which is reportedly costing £1.6 million a year, with calls for the funds to be redirected to road repairs. The Conservative opposition argues that selling the stadium would free up £6,500 monthly per ward, benefitting the wider community rather than just stadium users. This proposal comes as councillors prepare for a budget discussion on February 25, which includes a 4.99% council tax hike. Meanwhile, Salford Labour supports keeping the stadium, citing its importance for the city’s rugby strategy and events like the Women's Rugby World Cup. The Council purchased the stadium for £7.7 million in late 2024, and due to financial commitments, it can’t sell until 2028.
