Harry Styles fans can snag tickets for his one-off gig in Manchester for just £20! The link went live on Ticketmaster at 1 PM GMT, and the show is set for 6 March at the Co-op Live, coinciding with his new album release. To grab tickets, fans need to log into Ticketmaster, but be prepared for a wait—some are facing delays of up to 50 minutes due to high demand. Originally, you could request four tickets, but that’s been reduced to two now. The request window is open until 11 AM BMT on Sunday, 9 January. Keep in mind, just requesting tickets doesn’t guarantee you’ll get them; fans will find out if their requests are fulfilled via email later. Plus, a selection of tickets is available for American Express Card members. Co-op Live has pledged to prioritise true fans in the ticketing process, but specifics on how this will work are still under wraps.
