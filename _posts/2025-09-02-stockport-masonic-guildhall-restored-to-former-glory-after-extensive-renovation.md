Stockport Masonic Guildhall, a stunning Victorian building on Wellington Road South, has been beautifully refurbished to its 1868 glory. After years of neglect, the Freemasons launched an extensive renovation project about seven years ago, significantly improving its accessibility and aesthetics. While some upper floor rooms still need finishing touches, the Guildhall is back in action, regularly hosting events like weddings and festivals. Coming up is the popular Mind Body Spirit event, offering a weekend full of workshops and activities focused on wellness. The Guildhall, which has a rich history including serving as a Sunday School and shelter for evacuee children during WWII, continues to serve the community. Cheshire Freemason Andy Ferri shared excitement about its new role as a hospitality venue for all sorts of events. The restoration was managed by local companies, Stone Central and Touchstone Glazing.
