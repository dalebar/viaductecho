Stockport Masonic Guildhall has been beautifully refurbished, restoring its Victorian charm from 1868. After years of being in poor shape, the Freemasons embarked on this extensive restoration project about seven years ago. While it's nearly complete, some upper floor rooms still need work. The refurbishment has made the venue more accessible and visually impressive—ideal for various events. The Guildhall regularly hosts weddings and festivals, including the upcoming Mind Body Spirit event, which promises a weekend packed with workshops and activities. 

Historically, the Guildhall has served many roles, starting as a Sunday School, and later became home to the Freemasons in 1932. It’s witnessed significant moments in history, even housing evacuee children during WWII. Public tours of the newly renovated space were held on August 30, with Cheshire Freemason Andy Ferri highlighting the venue's dual role in hospitality and Freemasonry. The project was managed by Stone Central and Touchstone Glazing, marking a vibrant new chapter for this historic building.
