In February 1998, seven men from Bolton became known as the ‘Bolton 7’, facing trial for consensual same-sex acts in their homes, unaware they were breaking a little-known law from the 1967 Sexual Offences Act. This high-profile case not only affected their lives severely, leading to job losses and public ridicule, but also highlighted ongoing discrimination against gay men long after homosexuality was decriminalised in the UK. Human rights activist Peter Tatchell condemned the prosecution as malicious and homophobic, resulting in a campaign for LGBT+ rights that ultimately contributed to the full decriminalisation of homosexuality in England and Wales. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester hospitals are grappling with a winter crisis, marked by long patient wait times. Additionally, survivor Yoni Finlay shares his miraculous experience after being shot during a synagogue attack, expressing how his faith has grown following the incident. The Buzzcocks’ Steve Diggle reminisces about his band's beginnings and the infamous Sex Pistols gig. Lastly, Manchester remembers football legend George Best, who passed away 20 years ago, leaving a lasting legacy.
