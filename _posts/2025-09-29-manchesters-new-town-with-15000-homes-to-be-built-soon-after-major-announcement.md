Labour has announced plans to expedite the building of 15,000 homes in Manchester’s Victoria North area, part of a broader 20-year strategy for seven neighbourhoods. The government has designated this project as one of the first 12 'new towns' promised in the last election. Housing Secretary Steve Reed highlighted the aim to create appealing communities with essential amenities and jobs for locals. Manchester council leader Bev Craig expressed optimism about faster progress thanks to government backing, noting the transformative potential of this initiative. The plan also involves collaboration across various government departments to address challenges, such as opening new schools and GP surgeries. Overall, there’s a strong belief that with support, the housing development can be accelerated significantly, potentially completing the 15,000 homes in just over a decade.
