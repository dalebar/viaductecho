Netflix has just dropped a new series called "Run Away," based on Harlan Coben's book, and it features scenes filmed in Stockport. Premiering on 1 January 2026, the show highlights local spots like Market Place, filmed back in May 2025. With a top-notch cast including James Nesbitt and Ruth Jones, it’s already been praised by critics, with The Guardian calling it a "deeply pleasing Harlan Coben thriller" about a father's search for his missing daughter. Coben himself shared that the story dives into family secrets and the hidden lives behind closed doors. This isn’t Stockport’s first brush with the screen; the town has previously hosted filming for Coben’s "Fool Me Once," along with popular series like "Peaky Blinders."
