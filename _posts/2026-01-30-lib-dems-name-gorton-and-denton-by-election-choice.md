The Liberal Democrats have picked Jackie Pearcey as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election, taking place on 26 February after Andrew Gwynne's resignation due to health issues. Pearcey, a long-time local resident and a governor at Oasis Academy Aspinal for over 20 years, expressed her excitement about the nomination. She believes voters deserve better than the current Labour government and the divisive approach of Reform UK. With a doctorate in nuclear physics, she’s known for her local campaigning, notably saving Gorton Monastery. Pearcey aims to address key issues like the cost of living, the NHS, and local businesses, promising to fight for the residents of Gorton and Denton.
