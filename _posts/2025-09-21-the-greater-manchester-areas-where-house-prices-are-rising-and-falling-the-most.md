House prices in Greater Manchester have shown a mixed bag over the past year, with Manchester itself seeing a dip of about £6,400, now averaging £249,000. It’s one of 61 areas in the UK to experience a price drop, alongside some parts of London. In contrast, Oldham's property prices skyrocketed by 8.3%, making the average home there £206,000—one of the largest increases in the UK. Wigan and Tameside also saw decent rises, with prices going up by 5.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Other boroughs like Bolton and Bury enjoyed price hikes of 3% and 3.4%. While Manchester residents face a challenging market, places like Sunderland are booming with a substantial 12.7% increase, making it the current hotspot. On the flip side, areas in East Sussex and Wales are experiencing notable decreases. So, whether you're buying or just watching, it’s a real mixed bag out there!
