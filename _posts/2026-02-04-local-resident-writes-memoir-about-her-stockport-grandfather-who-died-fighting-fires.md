A memoir titled "The Last Call Out," written by Linda Lamon, grandson of a Stockport firefighter, is set for release to raise funds for a permanent headstone at Willow Grove Cemetery on the anniversary of his death. Linda’s journey began after discovering her grandfather, John F Lamon, was honoured on the Roll of Honour Shield at Whitehill Fire Station after his death in 1938. With family history shrouded in mystery and misinformation about the grave being washed away, Linda’s decade-long research unveiled the truth about his life and tragic death. The book highlights family life in 1930s Stockport, the 1935 fire at Stockport County FC, and Linda’s own memories from the 1950s to the 2000s. Available in paperback and eBook on Amazon, copies can also be found at the Fireground Museum in Rochdale. To promote the memoir, Linda will host talks and signings at local Stockport libraries on April 19 and May 16.
