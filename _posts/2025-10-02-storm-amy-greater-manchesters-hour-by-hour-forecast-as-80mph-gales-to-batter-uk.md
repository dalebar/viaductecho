Storm Amy is rolling into the UK this weekend, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. Tonight in Greater Manchester, expect nine hours of rain and increasing wind speeds, with a peak gust of 39 mph by 11pm. While the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for parts of the North West, Greater Manchester isn't directly affected, but it will still feel the storm's effects in the coming days. 

Tomorrow (Friday), it'll start dry with some sun, but clouds will gather, leading to heavier rain by evening. Gusts could reach 41 mph. Saturday will be cooler with light rain and winds peaking at 47 mph. 

On a brighter note, keep an eye on the daily weather updates to stay prepared. Stay safe, and might be a good time for your brolly!
