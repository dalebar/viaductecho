A large gathering took place at the Zakariyya Jaam'e Masjid in Bolton for the funeral of three teenage boys who tragically died in a crash on January 12. The victims, Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, Farhan Patel, and Mohammed Danyaal, were in a red Seat Leon that collided with a Citroen taxi driven by 54-year-old Masrob Ali, who also lost his life. Both the funeral and prayers drew hundreds of mourners, with touching tributes shared. 

The crash, which occurred shortly after midnight, involved four fatalities and left five others in hospital, including one woman with potentially life-threatening injuries. Greater Manchester Police are investigating the incident and have requested any witnesses or those with dashcam footage to come forward. They’ve also warned the public against sharing any footage on social media due to the distress it may cause the families involved. The emergency services received praise for their rapid response to what was described as a challenging scene.
