Police converged on Flixton railway station in Greater Manchester on the night of October 22 after reports of a trespass incident. Officers from British Transport Police arrived around 7pm, leading to the arrest of a 29-year-old man on suspicion of obstructing the railway. Multiple police vehicles were at the scene, and disruption ensued for passengers, with Northern services running at a reduced speed. By 9:20pm, the line was declared clear, but delays were noted earlier due to the situation.
