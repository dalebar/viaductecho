A flood alert is in place for parts of Stockport today (9 December) due to heavy rain and wind from Storm Bram. The Environment Agency warns that flooding is 'possible' in areas around the River Mersey catchment, with the alert lasting until 10am on Wednesday 10 December. The low-lying areas like Micker, Cringle, Sinderland, and Poynton Brooks are most at risk. However, the agency doesn't expect to issue a flood warning, meaning severe flooding isn't anticipated. They're keeping a close eye on the rainfall and river levels. Residents are advised to steer clear of low-lying footpaths and bridges near watercourses.
