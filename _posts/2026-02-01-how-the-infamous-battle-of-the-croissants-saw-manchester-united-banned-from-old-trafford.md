In September 1977, Manchester United’s first European Cup Winners Cup clash with Saint-Etienne was marred by a violent incident now known as the 'Battle of the Croissants'. Roughly 1,000 United fans travelled to France, but before the match, some supporters caused chaos, vandalising property and clashing with police. Tensions escalated when home fans began hurling stale baguettes and other objects, leading to a massive brawl that saw 33 people injured. Despite the ruckus, the match went ahead, ending in a 1-1 draw thanks to a goal from Gordon Hill.

The aftermath led to United being banned from Europe, triggering a backlash from politicians. However, they managed to appeal and were readmitted under strict conditions, having to play the second leg 200 miles away at Plymouth. The team triumphed, but the glory was fleeting as they were eliminated in the next round by Porto. Overall, this turbulent night overshadowed United's European campaign, illustrating the persistent problem of violence among football fans.
