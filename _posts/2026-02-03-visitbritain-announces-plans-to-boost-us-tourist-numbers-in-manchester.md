VisitBritain's set to ramp up US and French tourism in the North West by directing nearly £400,000 to Marketing Manchester. This funding will promote key routes, particularly focusing on flights from Paris to Liverpool and New York to Manchester via Virgin Atlantic. The initiative aims to showcase the region’s rich culture, dining, and outdoor activities while highlighting Manchester as a pivotal access point to North Wales and the Peak District. In partnership with various local tourism organisations, they're eager to enhance visitor experiences beyond the usual sights. Predictions for 2026 show a 1% and 4% increase in visits from the USA and France respectively, which could bring in over £9 billion in total spending. VisitBritain’s CEO emphasised the importance of collaboration in showcasing the region’s offerings. Alongside this, the ongoing 'Starring GREAT Britain' campaign aims to entice visitors by featuring iconic film and TV locations, proving to be a massive success since its launch. Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic is reacting positively to Aer Lingus cutting long-haul services by expanding its own routes to ensure accessibility for more international visitors.
