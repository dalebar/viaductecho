Noel Gallagher is set to receive the Songwriter of the Year award at this year's BRITs ceremony in Manchester on February 28. Recognised for his exceptional songwriting talent, the Oasis frontman will accept the award during the event at Co-op Live, marking its first time there. This recognition comes after Noel's recent successful world tour with brother Liam, leading to a highly-publicised reunion that excited fans. The BRITs highlighted Noel's enduring influence in British music over the past 30 years, noting his iconic tracks with Oasis and his solo work with Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds. Previous winners of the award include Ed Sheeran and Charli XCX. Noel, who has multiple BRIT awards to his name, is celebrated for songs like ‘Wonderwall’ and ‘Champagne Supernova’, which resonate across generations. The awards will be hosted by Jack Whitehall and feature a trophy designed by Manchester's own Matthew Williamson. The BRITs Chair praised Noel for crafting songs that have become part of the communal British narrative, acknowledging his remarkable legacy in music.
