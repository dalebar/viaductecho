Ricky Hatton, the former boxing world champion, not only inspired millions in the ring but also opened up important discussions about men's mental health. His candidness helped highlight a critical issue in the UK, where over 125 men take their lives weekly, making suicide the leading cause of death for men under 50. This prompted Elaine Roberts and Luke Ambler to establish Andy's Man Club in 2016, creating a space for men aged 18 and older to share their feelings without judgement. The club has expanded significantly, now hosting over 300 sessions nationwide, including more than 20 in Greater Manchester. With Rickyâ€™s support, including promoting the club during his 2022 comeback fight, attendance spiked and raised awareness for the cause. The Manchester Evening News is now launching a campaign to honour Ricky by raising funds for Andy's Man Club and CALM, both working tirelessly to support those battling mental health issues. Donations will help sustain and expand these vital services. Andy's Man Club meetings occur every Monday at 7pm, and they're open to all.
