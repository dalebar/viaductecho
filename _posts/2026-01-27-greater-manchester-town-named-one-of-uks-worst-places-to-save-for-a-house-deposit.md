A town in Greater Manchester has ranked poorly for saving a house deposit in the UK. A study reveals some areas could take up to 18 years to save enough for a typical deposit. Bath is listed as the worst place, requiring 18 years with house prices averaging £563,050 and local wages around £32,481. Ewell follows closely, needing 16 years with average prices at £582,752. Altrincham in Trafford is also in the top 10 worst, with an average house price of £538,225, taking 15 years to save up for a deposit. In contrast, places like Greenock are much more affordable, needing just five years to save for a deposit, making home ownership more achievable. The data highlights the significant barriers potential buyers face depending on where they live, with many feeling priced out before they even start.
