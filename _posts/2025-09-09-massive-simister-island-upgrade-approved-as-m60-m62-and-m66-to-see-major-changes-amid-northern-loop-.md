The upgrade around Simister Island, a busy motorway junction in the north-west used by about 90,000 vehicles daily, has been approved. The project aims to ease congestion on the M60, M62, and M66 by building a new ‘northern loop’ to allow smoother traffic flow without relying on traffic lights. Key features include a free-flow link from M60 eastbound to southbound, widening the M66 to four lanes, and converting the hard shoulder into a regular lane. The scheme, projected to cost between £207m and £340m and take around two years to complete, has been hailed as beneficial for the local and regional economy. Improvements in signage, signalling, and drainage are also part of the works. National Highways believes the enhancements will lead to safer and more reliable journeys, particularly improving traffic flow through Junction 18.
