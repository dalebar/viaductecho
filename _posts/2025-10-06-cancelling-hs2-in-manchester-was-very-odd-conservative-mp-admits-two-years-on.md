Jerome Mayhew, the Conservatives' shadow rail minister, recently reflected on the decision to cancel the Northern leg of HS2 in Manchester, calling it 'very odd' but ‘rationally’ the right choice. Speaking at a Conservative conference in Manchester, he highlighted the financial success of the Southern leg for businesses, while expressing concerns about the massive over-budget issues of the first phase. Mayhew argued this experience has made politicians wary of future large infrastructure projects, which he feels are necessary for substantial progress. He believes the £36bn saved from HS2 could enhance existing infrastructure, though he admitted the real benefits come from completing such projects in their entirety. In response, a government source critiqued Mayhew for deflecting blame and emphasised efforts to address HS2's prior mismanagement. The Transport Secretary is pushing for a reset to get HS2 back on track, including renegotiating contracts for better efficiency and value for taxpayers.
