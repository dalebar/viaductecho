An 18-year-old lad named Theo Wright from Royton was stabbed in the neck and lung while chasing a thief who stole a girl’s phone in Tenerife. It happened on the last day of his first lads' holiday, and Theo feared for his life when he saw the blood after the attack. He’d initially encouraged the girl to lend her phone, thinking it was an emergency, but when the thief fled, he ran after him. Unfortunately, Theo was stabbed twice and collapsed, but he’s now expected to make a full recovery, though he won’t be flying home for a couple of weeks. His mum, Caroline, panicked when she received the news and rushed to be by his side. They’ve set up a GoFundMe to cover her expenses, raising over £6,000 so far. Theo doesn’t regret his actions, feeling it was just his instinct to help, but he’s modestly uncomfortable being called a hero. They’re now hoping for understanding from his college due to his upcoming exams.
