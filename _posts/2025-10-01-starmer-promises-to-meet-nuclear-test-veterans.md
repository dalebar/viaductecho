Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to meet with veterans of Britain’s Cold War nuclear testing programme, aiming for a meeting by the year's end. He acknowledged that he wasn’t aware of previous attempts by veterans to contact him but plans to follow up on it. Alan Owen, from the charity LABRATS, expressed disbelief that the government was unaware of the veterans’ requests to meet the PM. Starmer also shared a personal connection to the issue, believing that radiation may have contributed to his four-month-old son Steven’s tragic death in 1962.
