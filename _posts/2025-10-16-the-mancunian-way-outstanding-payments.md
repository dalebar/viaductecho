A few artists from Manchester Pride are still waiting on payment for their performances from this year's event, which took place over the August Bank Holiday. High-profile acts like Olly Alexander and Nelly Furtado headlined, but some performers have voiced frustration online over a lack of communication and clarity regarding their pay. RuPaul's Drag Race UK star Zahirah Zapanta expressed disappointment, highlighting the issue of delayed payments despite high ticket prices. The Manchester Pride Board acknowledged the situation and is working with legal and financial advisers, promising further updates soon. 

In other news, the inquest into boxing legend Ricky Hatton's death opened, revealing a preliminary cause of death as 'hanging'. Meanwhile, the mayor is challenging British Transport Police's new policy on bike theft investigations, arguing it could discourage cycling. Manchester United is optimistic about acquiring land for a new stadium, and a new Manchester Edition of Monopoly is set to be released next month, featuring over 30 city landmarks. Lastly, Rudyâ€™s pizza has grown from a small eatery to a recognisable brand, showcasing Manchester's entrepreneurial spirit.
