Plans for 185 new apartments in Salford's city centre are moving forward, centred around a green courtyard at the Farmer Norton car park site near Adelphi Street and Peru Street. This development is part of the larger £2.5bn Salford Crescent regeneration project, led by ECF, Salford council, and Salford University. The council has recommended approval for this second phase, which would include mostly one and two-bedroom flats but no designated affordable housing due to financial constraints. The first phase will deliver 42 townhouses, also marketed at full price, raising concerns about affordability amid increasing homelessness in the area. Salford council is working to address the homelessness crisis, which has worsened recently, with figures showing a rise in cases and children in temporary accommodation. Overall, while new homes are on the horizon, the lack of affordable options is a pressing issue for the local community.
