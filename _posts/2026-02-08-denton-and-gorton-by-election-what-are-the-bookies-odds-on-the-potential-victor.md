Voting in Gorton and Denton is heating up as 11 candidates gear up for the by-election on February 26, 2026, after Andrew Gwynne stepped down. Residents must register by February 10 to take part. In the betting world, the Greens’ Hannah Spencer leads as the favourite at 5/6, followed closely by Reform UK’s Matt Goodwin at 13/8. Labour's Angeliki Stogia is seen as a long shot at 9/1. Other candidates like Advance UK’s Nick Buckley and the Conservatives’ Charlotte Anne Cadden are considered even less likely to win, with odds of 200/1 and 500/1, respectively. The political situation is dynamic, and these odds can shift rapidly. The full list of candidates includes a mix of parties from the Green Party to the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. It's all to play for in this key Manchester constituency!
