First-time buyer hotspots have emerged, with a city near Greater Manchester, Preston, seeing a 70% rise in mortgage applications over the last decade. Despite the struggle for young people in the UK to enter the property market due to high prices and other financial barriers, some areas are experiencing increased demand. Harlow leads the pack with an 87% increase in applications, followed by Knowsley at 82% and Stratford-on-Avon at 74%. Regions like North East England showed the highest increase overall at 26%, while London saw a decline of 15%. The South East still dominates in total applications despite smaller growth rates lately. Steve Mariner from Barratt Redrow commented on the positive trend, highlighting recent reductions in mortgage rates thanks to Bank of England cuts. He also noted that many first-time buyers are unaware of supportive schemes available to them, like the enhanced Key Worker Scheme offering up to Â£25,000 towards deposits.
