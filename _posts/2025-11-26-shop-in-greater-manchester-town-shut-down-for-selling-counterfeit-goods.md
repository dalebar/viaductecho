A shop in Hyde, UK Store, has been shut down for selling counterfeit cigarettes, tobacco, and vapes after Tameside Trading Standards seized 27,840 illegal cigarettes and 4.75kg of hand-rolling tobacco. The shop, located on Clarendon Street, had a history of illegal sales. Magistrates granted a three-month closure order based on evidence from Trading Standards and Greater Manchester Police, citing a high likelihood of continued illegal activity. Coun Laura Boyle from Tameside council highlighted the negative impacts of the illegal tobacco trade on crime, legitimate businesses, public health, and youth. She commended officers for securing the closure order, aiming to disrupt harmful activities in the community.
