Northern trains from Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Airport are cancelled today due to staff shortages. Buses are replacing these services until the end of the day. There's also a chance of delays or cancellations on trains to Manchester Oxford Road. Northern tickets can now be used on TransPennine Express and East Midlands Railway services between Liverpool and Manchester, with ticket restrictions lifted temporarily. Replacement bus times are available from Liverpool Lime Street at 14:30, 16:30, and 18:30, and from Manchester Piccadilly back at 16:25, 18:25, and 20:25. Make sure to check station posters for bus pick-up spots. A Northern spokesperson has mentioned the disruption is due to a shortage of train crew.
