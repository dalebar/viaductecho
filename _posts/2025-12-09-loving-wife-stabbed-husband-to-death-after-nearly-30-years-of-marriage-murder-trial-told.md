In a murder trial, Daryl Berman, 71, is accused of stabbing her 84-year-old husband, David Berman, to death at their home in Prestwich after nearly 30 years of marriage. She has pleaded not guilty, claiming his death was accidental, suggesting he fell onto a knife she was using. Prosecutors argue otherwise, suggesting the stab wound indicates a deliberate attack. Initially treated as an accident, further investigation revealed potential signs of homicide. Jurors heard that Mrs Berman appeared emotionless in the days following his death. Family noticed she seemed unfazed, with behaviour that raised suspicions. Alongside his recent dementia diagnosis, Mr Berman had been doing well before his death, having spent time with family that day. Mrs Berman called emergency services, but her account of the incident has inconsistencies, leading to her arrest five days later after a post-mortem. Prosecutors are asking the jury to determine if this was a tragic accident or a deliberate act. Mrs Berman maintains her innocence.
