On Thursday in Stockport, expect a mix of cloudy skies and rain, especially in the morning and afternoon. Temperatures will be quite mild, ranging from 13°C to 16°C. The day starts off with some sunshine but quickly turns wetter, so definitely pack your waterproofs as there's an 81% chance of rain.

For commuters, it’s wise to allow extra travel time due to slippery roads and possible public transport delays. Be cautious if you’re driving or cycling.
