Stockport is set to welcome a new Lidl after successfully appealing a previous planning rejection by the council. The supermarket will be built on the derelict Cheadle Heath Works site on Stockport Road. Initial plans were shot down in 2025 due to worries about traffic and the area's charm, triggering a heated council meeting where Lidl faced accusations of 'disgusting' tactics. After local support and a review by the Planning Inspectorate, Lidl's proposal was approved, as it wouldn’t harm the area's character and would enhance the site. Despite highways concerns raised by local councillor David Meller, the inspector found no fault with the council’s decision-making, leading to disappointment from the council, who even sought costs from Lidl for the appeal. Still, they were refused, and a spokesperson stated they’re reviewing options following the ruling. Ultimately, this move will demolish the eyesore that’s been the old Deanprint building, making way for something new in the community.
