Two new Little Dessert Shop locations have opened in Greater Manchester—one in Bury at The Rock and the other set to launch in Rochdale this Saturday, October 11. Founded by Zaeem Chohan and Maz Ali in 2015, these dessert cafes are known for their viral treats and promise high-quality sweets in a welcoming atmosphere. The Bury opening saw large crowds, with free treats offered, and Rochdale will kick off with the first 100 visitors receiving free waffles and a 50% discount on the menu for the day. Co-Founder Mu’Azzam Ali expressed excitement about bringing their desserts to these vibrant towns, aiming to build a community presence. This expansion joins their established locations across the UK, including spots in Manchester and other major cities. Both cafes are open daily from 11am to 11pm, with Bury located at St John’s Gardens, near Costa and M&S, and Rochdale on Milkstone Road.
