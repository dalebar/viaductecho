Stockport Pyramid has undergone a fantastic transformation, reopening as the Royal Nawaab restaurant and events venue in April 2025. Known for its Indian and Pakistani cuisine, the venue offers an impressive space spanning multiple floors, each with unique Moroccan-inspired design. The grand entrance leads to a stunning foyer and expansive event spaces perfect for weddings and corporate events. 

The ground floor boasts a luxurious banqueting hall catering up to 400 guests, designed to feel cozy despite its size. Diners have access to a variety of dishes, from starters like samosas and kebabs to a wide range of mains like Tikka Masala and vegetarian options, all freshly prepared by a dedicated team. Desserts include traditional delights like Gajar Halwa and Umm All. 

With a focus on quality, Royal Nawaab has quickly gained rave reviews and even multiple nominations in the This Is Manchester Awards. For Â£29.99 per adult, guests can enjoy a lavish buffet experience, making it a new gem in Stockport's dining scene.
