A tragic incident occurred in Manchester when a car was driven into pedestrians outside a synagogue, resulting in the deaths of two people and the suspected attacker being shot by police. Greater Manchester's mayor, Andy Burnham, was at BBC Radio Manchester nearby when reports came in. Eyewitnesses described the chaos as armed officers confronted the suspect lying on the ground. Paramedics arrived shortly after to assist the injured, four individuals in total. The attack drew widespread reactions, with King Charles expressing shock and sadness, especially given its significance for the Jewish community. By early afternoon, police confirmed the suspect had died from their injuries.
