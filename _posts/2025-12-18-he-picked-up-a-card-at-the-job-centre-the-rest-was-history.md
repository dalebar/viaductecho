He spent nearly 35 years in the industry before starting his own business this year. Paul reflects on the surreal beginnings of his career, now viewing it as a privilege to help families through funerals. His work involves both emotional support and meticulous organisation, adapting to modern trends like personalised music choices and comfortable clothing for the deceased. 

He takes pride in his beautifully designed office, aiming to make clients feel at ease during difficult conversations. Paul’s compassionate approach shines through, as local florist Katherine highlights his thoughtful gestures during her mother's care. Though he regularly encounters death, Paul emphasizes the importance of remaining sensitive and engaged rather than complacent. He encourages others to plan for the inevitable, allowing families to focus on celebrating life. Ultimately, his experience has given him a deeper perspective on life and death, motivating him to help others while appreciating each day.
