The BBC has denied plans to move Strictly Come Dancing to Manchester, although a source claims the idea is being taken seriously by a senior boss, possibly due to ongoing controversies surrounding the show. Filmed in Elstree for years, there's talk of relocating to Dock 10 at Media City in Salford for a fresh start. The source suggested this could help the BBC reset its image after a tough period for the show. Despite these whispers, a BBC spokesperson confirmed there are no plans for a move, calling the speculation unfounded. Additionally, there will be new presenters next season, as Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman are stepping down after many years. Commenting on their departure, some believe it could be a good opportunity to introduce male presenters to balance the show's female-led hosting.
