Oldham Council has released the bin collection schedule for Christmas and New Year 2025, noting several changes due to bank holidays on weekdays. Collections may shift, especially for those on Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and New Year's Day. Residents should double-check their collection dates to avoid missing a pick-up, as there's usually more waste this time of year. Extra recycling will be picked up if it’s well presented and labelled.

Here’s the festive schedule: 
- **Christmas Day (25th Dec):** Blue bins collected on 29th, Grey bins on 30th, Brown bins on 31st, and Green bins with food caddies on 3rd Jan.
- **Boxing Day (26th Dec):** Normal collections resume.
- **New Year's Eve (29th-31st Dec):** Normal collections for blue, grey, brown bins; earlier green collections until 24th and later from 5th-7th Jan.

For disposing of real Christmas trees, residents can chop them up for green bins or drop them off at specific parks or the Arkwright Street centre from 28th Dec to 7th Jan. Happy holidays, Oldham!
