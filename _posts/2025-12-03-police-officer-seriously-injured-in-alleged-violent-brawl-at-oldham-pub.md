A police officer sustained serious injuries while trying to break up a brawl at the Church Inn pub in Failsworth, Oldham, on October 31. The incident led to a licensing hearing on December 1, where it was revealed that the officer was hospitalised and is now recovering. A local man, Harry Hesketh, has been charged with GBH, affray, and drug possession. Councillor Sajid Hussain voiced concerns for the officer's safety and sought reassurances that new measures would prevent such incidents in the future. Representatives for the pub highlighted its long-standing community role, having operated since 1929 without prior issues. Local residents also advocated for its continued operation, praising the staff and atmosphere. The committee decided the pub could remain open under its current hours but outlined new security conditions, including more SIA-trained staff and enhanced checks by the brewery. Plans were mentioned to transition the pub into more of an eatery in the future.
