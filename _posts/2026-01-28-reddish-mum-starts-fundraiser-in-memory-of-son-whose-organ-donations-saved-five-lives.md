Dawn Letham from Reddish is raising funds for a memorial garden at Tameside Hospital in memory of her son, Mark, who passed away after a seizure and cardiac arrests. Despite the tragic circumstances, Mark's decision to be an organ donor has saved five lives, earning him his 'superhero wings'. To honour him and the caring staff who supported them, Dawn started this fundraiser, hoping to create a peaceful space for reflection at the hospital. She recalls the compassion shown by the team, who spoke to Mark even while he was sedated, making a lasting impression on her as a mother. They've raised £1,476 so far, and the overwhelming support has helped Dawn cope with her grief while inspiring others to join the organ donor registry. The fundraiser continues, with the aim of keeping Mark’s memory and legacy alive.
