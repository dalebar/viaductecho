The former Ups N Downs pub site on Wellington Road South is on the market for £700,000, with plans to convert it into 14 luxury apartments and a commercial space for a shop or café. The approved plans include five one-bedroom and nine two-bedroom flats. Although the conversion was initially approved in 2024, work has yet to commence, and the building has been labelled a "derelict eyesore." Its history dates back around 200 years, originally opening as the Wellington Bridge Inn. Over the years, it transformed into a popular pub known as Ups N Downs in the 1970s, becoming a lively spot in the town centre.
