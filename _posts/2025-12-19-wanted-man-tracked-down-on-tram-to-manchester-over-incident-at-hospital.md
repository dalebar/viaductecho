A wanted man was arrested after causing a ruckus at Ashton-under-Lyne bus station and then boarding a tram to Manchester. The incident, which unfolded on December 18, began when officers responded to reports of an intoxicated male harassing passengers and the bus driver. The tram was intercepted at Velopark, leading to the man’s arrest. It turned out he was also wanted for a racially aggravated incident at Oldham Hospital, where he had abused staff and security. Greater Manchester Police stressed that they won't tolerate aggression or violence on the transport network and emphasised their commitment to making it safer for everyone. The suspect is now in custody and will be interviewed soon.
