The old Beech Tree Pub in Heald Green, Stockport, is set to be auctioned off, much to the relief of nearby residents who’ve faced issues since its closure about four years ago. Locals claim the derelict site has turned into a hotspot for trouble, rubbish dumping, and even break-ins. It’s listed with a starting price of £650,000 and is seen as a prime candidate for redevelopment, with hopes for new homes in the area. Councillors from Heald Green Ratepayers are optimistic this could signal an end to the ongoing issues and improve the neighbourhood’s appearance. The auction ends on February 25.
