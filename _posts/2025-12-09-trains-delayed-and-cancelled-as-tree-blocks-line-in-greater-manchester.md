Train services in Greater Manchester are facing cancellations and delays due to a tree blocking railway lines between Salford Crescent and Wigan Wallgate. This has disrupted multiple routes across the North West, leading to diverts via Bolton. Stations between Swinton and Daisy Hill aren’t being served, and passengers are advised to travel to Wigan to head back toward Manchester. Services from Leeds to Wigan Wallgate, Blackburn to Headbolt Lane, and Manchester Victoria to Wigan North Western are also impacted. To ease the hassle, Northern has lifted ticket restrictions in the affected areas, allowing customers to use their tickets on certain bus routes without extra cost. A rail replacement service is also running between Manchester Victoria and Wigan Wallgate. Currently, maintenance teams are on-site working to resolve the issue, with disruptions expected to last until around 8pm.
