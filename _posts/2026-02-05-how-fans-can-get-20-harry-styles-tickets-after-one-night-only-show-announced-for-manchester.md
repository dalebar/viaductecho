Harry Styles has got fans buzzing with excitement after announcing a 'one night only' show in Manchester at Co-op Live on March 6, coinciding with the release of his new album, Kiss All The Time, Disco Occasionally. Tickets will go for £20 and requests open this Friday, February 6. The announcement stirred up a social media storm, especially since it followed his earlier tour reveal featuring only London dates. Fans are confused about the ticket request process, which Ticketmaster explained aims to eliminate the usual scramble for tickets. Instead, fans can request their desired tickets, but it doesn't guarantee they'll snag them. Harry's strong connection to Manchester, being from Cheshire, has some suggesting this gig is a response to backlash over his initial tour announcement. Ticket requests can be submitted starting Friday, but remember, it's all about luck! Keep an eye on your emails for updates!
