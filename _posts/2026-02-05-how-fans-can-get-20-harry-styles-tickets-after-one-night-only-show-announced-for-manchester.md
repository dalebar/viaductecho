Harry Styles has sent fans into a tizzy with the announcement of a 'one night only' show in Manchester at Co-op Live on March 6, coinciding with the release of his new album, *Kiss All The Time, Disco Occasionally*. Tickets will be priced at £20, and requests for them start on Friday, February 6. His Instagram post about the event garnered over 700,000 likes in an hour, with many fans confused about the ticket request process. Some speculated the Manchester show was a response to criticism for not including the city in his earlier tour announcement. 

Ticketmaster clarified that submitting a ticket request doesn’t guarantee a ticket; rather, it allows fans to select the type of ticket they want without the rush of a first-come, first-served system. If requested tickets are available, fans will be charged and given access to their tickets. The excitement comes after Styles announced record-breaking performances at Wembley Stadium, adding further anticipation for this Manchester gig.
