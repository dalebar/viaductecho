Merseyway's Pop Up Uniform Shop had a smashing success this year, selling a whopping 3,000 items and raising Â£1,270 for charity. Open from 8-15 August, the shop offered school uniforms for as low as 50p each, benefiting local charities like Chelwood Foodbank Plus and Stockport ARC Centre. 

This annual event not only helps families gear up for school but also provides essential support to the community. Footfall increased by 7% compared to last year, and over 100 volunteer hours were contributed by Merseyway staff, CBRE, and Vernon Building Society.

Cllr Wendy Meikle praised the shop as a lifeline for families, ensuring kids start school with confidence and easing financial burdens. Victoria Nichol, the Centre Manager, expressed her delight at the support from the community, highlighting the generous donations and engagement on social media. The event truly showcased the caring spirit of Stockport, making it a fantastic achievement for everyone involved!
