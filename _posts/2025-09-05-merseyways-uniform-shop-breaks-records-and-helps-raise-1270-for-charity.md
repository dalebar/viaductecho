The Pop Up Uniform Shop at Merseyway has had a fantastic run, selling 3,000 items and raising £1,270 for Chelwood Foodbank Plus and Stockport ARC Centre. Open from 8-15 August, the shop offered school uniforms for as little as 50p, making it a real lifesaver for families in the area. This year's event saw a 7% increase in visitors compared to last year, thanks to over 100 hours of volunteer work from local organisations. Cllr Wendy Meikle highlighted how vital the shop is for families, ensuring kids can start school confidently without breaking the bank. Meanwhile, Victoria Nichol, the Centre Manager, expressed her delight at the community's response and generosity, showcasing Stockport's strong community spirit. All in all, it’s been a brilliant success, demonstrating just how supportive and caring the local scene is.
