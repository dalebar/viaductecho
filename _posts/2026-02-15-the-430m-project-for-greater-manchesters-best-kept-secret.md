Oldham’s future is looking bright with a host of regeneration projects set to transform the town. Plans include 2,000 new homes, a new market, a secondary school backed by Eton, a £70m multi-sports facility, urban farming, and more green spaces. However, notable landmarks like Queen Elizabeth Hall might be demolished, and past projects have faced hiccups, leading to skepticism among locals. Town hall boss Arooj Shah insists that despite previous disappointments, progress is being made, with £430m already invested. Recent successes, like the transformation of the historic town hall into a vibrant community space, are boosting optimism. Local businesses are benefiting too, with firms like civil engineering company Rowan Ashworth experiencing significant growth thanks to council schemes. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham sees potential in these developments, linking them to broader economic advances. The overarching message is one of cautious optimism: Oldham is shedding its past struggles and aiming to establish itself as a thriving community, creating excitement about its twenty-year vision.
