The brother of Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, who tragically died in a horrific crash in Bolton, has shared a heartfelt TikTok message urging drivers to be cautious. Mohammed, 18, crashed his Seat Leon into a taxi, claiming the lives of himself and three others, including taxi driver Masrob Ali, 54. The brother expressed remorse and delivered a specific apology to Ali’s family, highlighting the dangers of reckless driving. He mentioned that Mohammed was reportedly speeding at 90mph, although this has yet to be confirmed by police. The investigation is ongoing, with officers looking into footage of high-speed driving possibly connected to the incident. Several passengers from both vehicles remain in hospital, with some suffering serious injuries. Authorities urge witnesses to step forward and share any relevant footage. Detective Inspector Andrew Page acknowledged the challenging situation for emergency services and appealed for public help to understand the full circumstances of the crash.
