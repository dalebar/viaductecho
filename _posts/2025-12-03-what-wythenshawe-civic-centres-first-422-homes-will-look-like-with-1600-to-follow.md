Wythenshawe is set to get 422 affordable homes as part of a £500m project to revitalise the area over 15 years. These homes aim to enhance the local community, featuring social rental options, a food hall, a cultural hub, and greener spaces. The development will include three blocks, starting with the transformation of Brotherton House into 216 new homes, including a care apartment for older people and those with dementia. Alpha House will become 125 apartments, and C2 The Birtles will have 81 additional apartments along with retail spaces. The council, in partnership with Muse, is keen to ensure the new homes create an inclusive, thriving town centre. However, local campaigners are advocating for a specialised facility for disabled people, emphasising the need for inclusive housing options that allow residents to stay within their communities. There's an ongoing discussion on how local housing associations might contribute to this need in Wythenshawe.
