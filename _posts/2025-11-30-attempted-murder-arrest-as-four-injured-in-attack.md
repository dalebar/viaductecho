Det Ch Insp Matthew Dixon described it as an "isolated" occurrence and is urging anyone who saw an altercation on Railway Street to step forward. The suspect, a white male in his 20s, was last seen heading towards Altrincham Interchange. For updates, you can catch BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds or follow them on social media.
