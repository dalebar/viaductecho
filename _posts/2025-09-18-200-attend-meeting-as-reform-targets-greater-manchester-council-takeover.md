About 200 Reform UK supporters gathered at Wigan Athletic's stadium for an exclusive event to promote their candidate, Lee Moffitt, in the upcoming council by-election. The event featured party chairman, Dr David Bull, who spoke about the potential for Reform to gain traction in Wigan, where Labour currently holds a significant council majority. Despite not predicting outright control of the council, Bull noted a dramatic shift in voter sentiment against the traditional parties, suggesting a possible surge for Reform in local elections next May. He emphasised the partyâ€™s commitment to grassroots growth and local issues, including a call for reversing certain traffic policies and advocating for a dedicated infrastructure department. Dr Bull expressed optimism for Reform's future in Wigan and the wider political landscape, hoping to encourage more locals to stand for election as they gear up for the next General Election.
