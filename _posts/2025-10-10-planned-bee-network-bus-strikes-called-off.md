The bus strikes planned for this weekend affecting the Bee Network have been called off. Drivers from Stagecoach and Metroline were set to strike on 10, 11, and 13 October but will now continue operations while Unite the Union ballots on a new pay offer. This decision was made on Thursday evening, so there might still be some delays for passengers today. Mayor Andy Burnham expressed appreciation for bus drivers and optimism for a swift agreement between the union and operators. Danny Vaughan from TfGM confirmed the cancellation means the 190 affected bus routes should operate as normal, though some limited disruptions may still occur. Passengers are advised to check their service status and allow extra time for travel.
