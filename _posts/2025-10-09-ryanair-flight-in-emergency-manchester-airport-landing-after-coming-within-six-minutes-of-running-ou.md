A Ryanair flight from Pisa to Prestwick faced a dramatic emergency landing in Manchester after coming alarmingly close to running out of fuel. Due to fierce winds from Storm Amy, the plane made several unsuccessful landing attempts at both Prestwick and Edinburgh on October 3. Unfortunately, just six minutes' worth of fuel was left when it finally diverted to Manchester, after issuing a 'fuel Mayday' alert. Passengers experienced chaos even before takeoff, with protests delaying their departure. One traveller described the anxiety during the descent and the relief felt upon landing safely. An investigation is now underway, with Ryanair cooperating but refraining from further comment at this stage.
