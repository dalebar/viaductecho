A commemorative plaque has been unveiled at the site of a former recording and rehearsal studio where Joy Division filmed the iconic video for "Love Will Tear Us Apart." According to Mr. Davidson, the building played a vital role for many bands, creating an exciting atmosphere that influenced their music. He noted that the area has drastically changed since the 70s and 80s, making it almost unrecognisable. Fans of BBC Radio Manchester can catch more on Sounds or connect via social media platforms.
