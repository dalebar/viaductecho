A judge has ruled that nearly £20m will be paid to children injured in the Manchester Arena bombing following the Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. This tragic event claimed 22 lives and left many more hurt. Judge Bird emphasised the shared struggle of the victims, acknowledging the deep suffering and mistakes made over the past eight-and-a-half years. In response to the tragedy, Martyn's Law was established to enhance safety measures in public venues to prevent future terror attacks.
