Plans to demolish the iconic Albert Bridge House in Manchester, one of the city's first high-rise towers from 1959, are on track for approval. Council planners have recommended that the 18-storey HMRC office block be replaced by two new skyscrapers, standing 37 and 49 storeys high, which will provide 800 apartments. The original redevelopment plans were stalled, leading developers, Oval, to propose a larger residential scheme that better suits modern needs. They aim to create a vibrant landmark with top-quality design and sustainable principles. Alongside the Albert Bridge House project, an additional 980 homes are under consideration, including 106 houses in Charlestown with 20% marked as affordable. However, there's been significant public opposition, with 11 objections specifically against the Albert Bridge development. The planning committee is set to meet on October 23 to debate this and other proposals, which have attracted numerous responses from residents.
