Rochdale’s roads, plagued by potholes, are set for repairs following a new funding boost. MP Paul Waugh applauded the Labour government's £7.3bn road maintenance programme, which doubles annual funds for councils to tackle deteriorating roads and associated vehicle repair costs. This is the largest investment ever in basic road maintenance, according to Labour. Rochdale will benefit through the Greater Manchester Combined Authority’s allocation from this transparent funding model. Waugh highlighted Labour's commitment to fixing an extra million potholes annually, stating that this investment will lead to improved journeys, safer routes for cyclists and pedestrians, and benefit local businesses reliant on transport links. The funding is aimed at keeping communities connected and the economy moving. Councils can start using this new funding right away, with more detailed local allocations coming soon.
