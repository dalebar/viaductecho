Residents in Salford are expressing serious concerns about rising crime and anti-social behaviour in their area. This came to light during a council meeting regarding plans for a new four-bedroom house of multiple occupation (HMO) on Ribot Walk, which was ultimately approved despite more than 240 objections. Locals, including Yee Man Winnie, voiced fears that the HMO could harm the community’s peacefulness, with many already investing in CCTV to combat crime. They also raised worries about potential parking chaos affecting access for residents and emergency services. The landlord, Tien Trinh, argued that the tenants are responsible young professionals contributing positively to the community, while property manager Jean-Luc Uddoh dismissed the fears as generalisations. He assured that the tenants were carefully vetted and not linked to the security concerns raised by locals. The police have been contacted for further comment.
