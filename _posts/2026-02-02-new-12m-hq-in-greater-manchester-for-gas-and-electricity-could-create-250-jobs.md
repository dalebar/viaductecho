Crown Gas & Power Limited (CG&P) has submitted plans for a new headquarters at Chamberhall Business Park in Bury, aiming to boost its business size with a £12m investment. The site, sold by the council last month, is expected to generate £310,000 in yearly business rates, inject £8m into the local economy, and create 250 jobs. The proposal includes a large office building and three smaller employment units, featuring staff amenities like a gym, open-plan workspaces, and a café. Barrowclough Architects describe the main office as a standout addition to the Chamberhall development, reflecting CG&P's commitment to being a pivotal employer in the area. The family-owned firm serves a notable share of the UK’s commercial gas and power markets and operates multiple businesses within Bury. Managing Director Matthew Greensmith expressed pride in their local roots and enthusiasm for the new HQ, supporting continued growth. A town planning decision is expected by the end of April.
