Manchester Airport is gearing up for its busy festive travel season, with plenty of folks looking to enjoy Christmas markets and winter sun. Although schools are still in session, many families are already off on their hols. However, bad weather can put a spanner in the works, causing delays and cancellations. Recently, Storm Bram brought strong winds and heavy rain, prompting Ryanair to advise passengers to check flight statuses closely. Thankfully, the storm has passed, and the weather's looking much better today, with the Met Office predicting sunny spells and little chance of rain. As of this morning, most flights are on schedule, but a few have faced delays of over 25 minutes. So, if you’re flying today, make sure to double-check your flight status!
