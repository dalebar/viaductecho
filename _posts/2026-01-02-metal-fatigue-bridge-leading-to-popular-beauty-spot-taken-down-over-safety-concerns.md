The Bailey Bridge over the River Mersey in Chorlton, which provided access to Chorlton Water Park, has been fully removed over safety concerns since February. Manchester City Council expects a replacement by July, pending planning permission. This closure has caused a two-mile detour for visitors, significantly affecting the elderly and disabled, who can no longer make the trip. Campaigners, like Elizabeth Bain, highlight the bridge’s importance for community access, particularly for those with mobility issues. Elizabeth's petition to reopen the bridge has gained over 2,400 signatures. The council is working on a new crossing and reviewing alternative routes to make them more user-friendly, reassuring residents that their safety is the top priority. However, there remains uncertainty about when access across the Mersey will be reinstated, leaving many locals like Jenny Quigley and Jackie Steer struggling with the impact on their daily lives.
