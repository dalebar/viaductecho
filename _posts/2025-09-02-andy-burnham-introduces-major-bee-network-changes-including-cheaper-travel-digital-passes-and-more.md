Andy Burnham's announced significant upgrades to the Bee Network, aiming for more frequent services, new night buses, and cheaper fares for young adults in Greater Manchester. Since bringing all local buses under public control, they've already seen a rise in ridership and are targeting a 30% uptick by 2030. A key change is the introduction of an 18-21 half-price monthly ticket, reducing costs from £80 to £40, which is a relief for around 50,000 teenagers transitioning from free travel. The mayor also revealed upcoming trials allowing pensioners and disabled passengers to use their concessionary passes before 9:30 am, responding to strong demand. Additionally, the Our Pass for 16-18-year-olds is going digital, making it easier to manage. Apple Pay users will benefit from 'Express Mode' for quicker payments on buses and trams. Overall, these changes show a commitment to enhancing public transport for the people of Greater Manchester.
