Andy Burnham has unveiled exciting updates for the Bee Network, aiming to improve bus services across Greater Manchester. Announced on September 1st, changes include more frequent services, new night buses, and a half-price monthly ticket for 18-21-year-olds, reducing fares from £80 to £40. This initiative will benefit around 150,000 young people, making education more accessible.

Additionally, there’s a trial for pensioners and disabled pass holders to travel before 9:30 am, responding to the high demand for early journeys, with 100,000 trips reported in August. A digital version of the Our Pass will make it easier for teens to manage their travel without losing their passes. 

Finally, Bee Network tickets are now compatible with Apple Pay's 'Express Mode', allowing for quicker boarding on buses and trams. Burnham emphasised that these changes are driven by public feedback, showcasing a commitment to enhancing public transport and supporting Greater Manchester’s growth.
