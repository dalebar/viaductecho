Andy Burnham has announced significant improvements to the Bee Network, including more frequent buses, new night services, and cheaper fares for young adults. With the transition to public control over Greater Manchester's bus services, officials aim to increase passenger numbers by 30% by 2030, following recent increases in specific areas. 

From September 1, a new half-price monthly ticket for those aged 18-21 will lower unlimited bus travel costs to Â£40, helping around 150,000 young people. Meanwhile, a trial will allow older and disabled passengers to use their concessionary passes before 9:30am, responding to strong demand for earlier travel. 

Additionally, the Our Pass for 16-18-year-olds is now digital, reducing the risk of losing it. Lastly, Bee Network tickets are now accessible via Apple Pay's Express Mode, making it easier for users to pay for their journeys. These changes reflect efforts to enhance public transport and support Greater Manchester's growing economy.
