A recent Freedom of Information request has highlighted the staggering number of parking fines dished out by Stockport Council, with 23,446 penalties issued from June 2024 to June 2025, generating a whopping Â£801,290 in income. Princes Street led the way with 483 fines, likely due to its proximity to the Merseyway Shopping Centre. Grenville Road wasn't far behind with 339 fines, followed by Lancaster Street with 310. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust is addressing parking issues at Stepping Hill Hospital by reintroducing parking enforcement officers in October 2025 and creating new staff parking areas. Director Gareth Hughes emphasises the importance of safety and improved experiences for hospital visitors and staff. With 5,900 employees and many patients daily, these measures aim to relieve parking pressures while promoting sustainable travel.
