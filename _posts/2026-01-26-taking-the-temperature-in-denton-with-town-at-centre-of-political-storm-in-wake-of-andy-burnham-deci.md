Denton's buzzing with political chatter as Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester Mayor, announced his intent to return to Westminster after Andrew Gwynne stepped down for health reasons. Gwynne faced recent scandals, prompting a vacancy for a Labour candidate in the Gorton and Denton by-election. However, Labour's National Executive Committee blocked Burnham's bid to avoid complicating the mayoralty situation, which has sparked outrage among locals. Voters like Stewart Parker and Mike Head expressed disappointment, arguing Burnham's popularity could enhance Labour's chances, while others highlighted concerns about union influence in the decision. Richard Sibley, despite not being a Labour fan, thinks Burnham should run, mentioning that he'd prefer him over current Labour leader Keir Starmer. Meanwhile, 70-year-old Phil Lord felt Burnham wasn’t the right candidate anyway, backing the Mayor of Salford instead. The tension's real in Denton, with opinions split on the right path forward for Labour.
