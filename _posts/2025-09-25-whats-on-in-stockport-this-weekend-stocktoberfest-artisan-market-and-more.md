This weekend in Stockport is packed with fun events, thanks to Worker Bee Markets and Waterside Hotel & Leisure Club. Firstly, Stocktoberfest runs from Friday to Sunday in the Underbanks, featuring a mix of food, music, and a great variety of beers from Runaway Brewery alongside local bars and tasty offerings from Honest Crust. 

On Saturday, the Reddish artisan pop-up market at Broadstone Mill Shopping Outlet from 11am-3pm showcases over 40 creative makers and traders, perfect for finding unique gifts, autumn goodies, and Halloween inspiration. There’ll also be face painting and delicious food options. 

Later that evening, Waterside Hotel is hosting a Salsa and Tapas Night where you can enjoy dancing and a selection of tasty tapas for just £15. It’s a brilliant chance to have a good time with friends or meet new people – so don’t miss out!
