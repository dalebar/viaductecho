Middleton might be getting a shiny new banqueting hall and wedding venue in the old Conservative club building. Developer Kohinoor Banqueting Limited is planning to turn it into a multi-use space for weddings and community events. They’re looking to add a two-storey extension and sprucing up the place with internal refurbishments and a revamped façade. The back area will become a car park with greenery, including a ‘green wall’. The developers want to keep the charm of the original building while making it fit for modern gatherings. This project is in line with the Middleton Town Centre Masterplan, aiming to rejuvenate the area, improve public spaces, and boost local businesses. Rochdale Borough Council is expected to decide on the plans soon.
