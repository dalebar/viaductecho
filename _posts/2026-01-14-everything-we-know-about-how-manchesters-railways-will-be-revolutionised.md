Manchester has been waiting over 15 years for a major rail upgrade, with many false starts and changes in government plans. However, city leaders are feeling hopeful as a new Liverpool-Manchester rail line and an underground Piccadilly station have been announced. This £1.1 billion project aims to reduce journey times to 35 minutes and improve train frequency, with ambitious ideas to make Piccadilly a key transport hub. An underground station is favoured over an overground one, as it would allow for future growth and better use of city space. Despite concerns about costs, local leaders are ready to chip in and are optimistic about a government review due in July. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves see this as a chance to boost the North's economy after years of neglect. Construction on the new rail line is set to start in July 2033, with hopes for further connections to other cities. The commitment represents a significant shift after previous setbacks, igniting renewed enthusiasm for Manchester’s rail future. It’s a promising moment for local leaders aiming for quicker, more efficient rail services.
