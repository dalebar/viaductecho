Five men were arrested in Wythenshawe following police drug raids, resulting in the seizure of £8,000 in cash, £10,000 worth of cocaine, £2,000 worth of crack, along with several batons and a knife. Officers executed four warrants this morning as part of an investigation into local drug dealing. Three of the men—aged 22, 23, and 55—were arrested on suspicion of supplying cocaine, with the younger two also facing charges related to offensive weapons and possession with intent to supply. They remain in custody as the investigation progresses. Det Sgt Paul Shacklady emphasised the importance of disrupting organised crime and urged locals to report any drug-related activities, either directly to the police or anonymously through Crimestoppers.
