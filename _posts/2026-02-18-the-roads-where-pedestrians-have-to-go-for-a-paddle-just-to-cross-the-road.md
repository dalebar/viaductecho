Drivers and pedestrians in Oldham, particularly in Shaw and Crompton, are facing risks due to blocked storm drains, as highlighted by Councillor Howard Sykes. He’s noted that many gullies have been clogged for years and some won't be cleared until May, leading to large puddles that can soak pedestrians and force drivers to swerve dangerously. Areas like Milnrow Road, Cowie Street, and Smallbrook Road frequently suffer from waterlogging, and Sykes has expressed frustration with the council's lack of response to the issue. While the council attributes these problems to heavy rainfall rather than blocked drains, they acknowledge previous delays in their cleaning schedule. Coun Chris Goodwin stated that despite investing in gulley cleaning, the team is following a ward-by-ward programme. He assured that they prioritise public safety and will address blocked gullies if they pose a flooding risk.
