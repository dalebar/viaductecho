This yellow warning, which started at midnight, is also in place for Cheshire, the Midlands, southern England, and part of Wales, lasting until midday. Folks are advised to be careful on the roads and pavements due to expected icy patches. This morning's temperatures are below 0C, but it should be a clear day overall, with temperatures possibly reaching up to 4C before lunchtime—though it’ll still feel colder. Tonight, expect more chilly weather, with temperatures dropping as low as -4C in some areas.
