Daniel Ramsay-Bradshaw, 34, and John Cooney, 26, were caught trying to smuggle 48.7 kilograms of cannabis into Manchester Airport after flying from Texas. They both had the same rehearsed excuses for Border Force officers, claiming they packed their own bags and were not coerced. The court revealed they were motivated by financial gain, aiming to clear drug debts. Cooney's defence highlighted his struggles with drug misuse and his ADHD and dyslexia, while Ramsay-Bradshaw was the main financial provider for his family after losing his job. Both men pleaded guilty to drug importation offences and were sentenced to 22 months in prison, suspended for two years. They must also complete 150 hours of unpaid work and 15 rehabilitation days.
