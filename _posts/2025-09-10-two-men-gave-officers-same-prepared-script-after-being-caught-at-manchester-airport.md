Daniel Ramsay-Bradshaw, 34, and John Cooney, 26, were caught trying to smuggle 48.7 kg of cannabis from Texas through Manchester Airport, using the same rehearsed excuses when stopped by Border Force. They had flown into the UK, initially claiming they packed their bags voluntarily. However, officers found vacuum-sealed packages of cannabis in their suitcases. During court proceedings, it was revealed that they aimed to wipe out drug debts for a financial gain. Cooneyâ€™s defence highlighted his ongoing drug issues and mental health struggles, while Ramsay-Bradshaw was noted for caring for his children and recently regaining employment after losing his job before the incident. Both men pleaded guilty to drug smuggling and were sentenced to 22 months in prison, suspended for two years, along with 150 hours of community service and 15 days of rehabilitation activities.
