Over Christmas last year, Greater Manchester saw a worrying trend with more than 700 motorists arrested for drink or drug driving. Twelve of these drivers were shockingly over four times the legal drink drive limit, needing to consume around a bottle of wine or eight pints of beer to reach such levels. A further 35 were three times the limit, while 99 were double. Most arrests occurred between 10pm and 1am, but early morning catches were notable too, with about 10% tested between 6 am and midday after partying. Just under 500 drivers faced charges following their arrests. Notably, around half of those arrested were suspected of drug driving. It’s a sobering reminder for party-goers to think twice before hitting the road after a night out!
