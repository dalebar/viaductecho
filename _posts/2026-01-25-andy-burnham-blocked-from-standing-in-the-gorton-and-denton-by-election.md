Andy Burnham has been barred from running in the Gorton and Denton by-election, as reported by the Press Association (PA). Sources mentioned that the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC) had a clear majority against his candidacy, mainly due to concerns over the costs of a mayoral by-election in Greater Manchester. This decision, made by a sub-group of the NEC led by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, has sparked backlash within the party, with figures like deputy leader Lucy Powell and Cabinet minister Ed Miliband advocating for local members to have the final say. The by-election was triggered by former MP Andrew Gwynne stepping down due to health issues. Burnham's potential candidacy, viewed by some as his return to Parliament, required NEC approval, which he sought after expressing a desire to return as a Labour MP. Despite his support from some prominent Labour figures, including Sadiq Khan, the NEC’s ruling has created tension and dissatisfaction, with predictions that the party might lose the by-election. If selected, Burnham would have had to resign as mayor, prompting yet another election for that role.
