A row of nine new homes might sprout up by the riverside in Bury's green area off Milltown Street, edging into Radcliffe and Whitefield. This land, once protected under local planning, is near the River Irwell and opposite Coronation Park. Planning consultants Connollys argue that due to a housing shortage and new builds nearby, this project should proceed. The homes will be mostly four-bed detached and are priced at £645k, adjacent to the recently completed Halcombe Grove. Connollys claim the site is sustainable and will help with local housing needs, with access from Milltown Street and Radcliffe New Road. A landscaping plan is also suggested to offset any environmental impact. The plot had previous development approval, expiring in June 2023, but the developer, JP Speak, is seeking more time to sort out details amid objections from neighbours concerned about traffic and wildlife. If Bury Council gives the thumbs up again, more approvals will be needed before construction.
