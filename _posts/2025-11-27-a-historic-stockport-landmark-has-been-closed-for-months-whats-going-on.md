Concerns are rising over the closure of Stockport Central Library, a historic landmark that shut for maintenance in May but has remained closed for six months. Stockport MP Navendu Mishra is seeking clarity from the council about its future, highlighting its importance for community access to education and services. While the council leader, Mark Roberts, reassured that there are no plans to close the library, he explained the delay is linked to relocating archives to a new facility, Stockroom, which has been quite successful since opening with over 500,000 visitors. He also noted issues of government underfunding affecting local services. Historic England praised the library's significance as a civic architectural gem, emphasising the need to keep such buildings in use for future generations. The call for an update on reopening plans and future library services in Stockport underscores the community's commitment to preserving their cultural heritage.
