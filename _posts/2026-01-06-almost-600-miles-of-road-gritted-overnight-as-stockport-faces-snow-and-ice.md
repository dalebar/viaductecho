On Monday 5 January, Stockport Council gritted nearly 600 miles of roads to tackle snow and ice amid a cold snap. They focused on 587 miles of priority routes, mainly A roads, main roads, and bus routes, as a yellow weather warning from the Met Office was in effect until 11am on Tuesday. Salt works best when traffic spreads it, but it’s less effective at lower temperatures, losing impact entirely at -8 degrees. Residents have been advised to use one of the 250 grit bins available to help keep public roads and pavements clear.
