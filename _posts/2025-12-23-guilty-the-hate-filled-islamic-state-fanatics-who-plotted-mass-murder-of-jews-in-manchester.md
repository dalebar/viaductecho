Two men, Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein, were found guilty of plotting an Islamic State-inspired mass murder targeting the Jewish community in Manchester. Their plans involved arranging to acquire firearms, conducting reconnaissance, and scouting potential attack sites from December 2023 to May 2024. The operation was foiled by an undercover operative, ‘Farouk’, who documented their intentions and interactions. During the trial, it emerged that Saadaoui had expressed anti-Semitic views online and aimed to target Jewish events and locations, including a talk with Countdown presenter Rachel Riley. Evidence showed that Saadaoui was heavily planning for what could have been the deadliest terror attack in UK history. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts highlighted the risk posed and praised the undercover operative for his role in preventing the attack. Despite Saadaoui’s claims of being pressured by Islamic State and attempts to distance himself from the plot, the jury found him and Hussein guilty, dismissing their defences. The Crown Prosecution Service commended the investigation that revealed their dangerous intentions and secured essential evidence. Bilel Saadaoui was also found guilty of failing to disclose terrorist acts.
