Andy Burnham has introduced a new 24/7 TravelSafe LiveChat service designed to enhance safety on the Bee Network. Launched on October 16, passengers can now report crime or anti-social behaviour directly to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) through the Bee Network app. Each report is handled by a real person, ensuring quick and compassionate responses, as explained by assistant chief constable Chris Sykes. Trained staff will monitor incidents via a camera network and coordinate appropriate responses, potentially involving police officers or travel safe enforcement officers (TSEOs). Burnham has appointed Chief Superintendent Sue Downey to lead this initiative, aiming to increase the uniformed presence across the network. He noted that this service marks a significant improvement, giving passengers reassurance that issues will be addressed more effectively than before. The GMP's '11th district' command structure will come into effect in spring next year, further enhancing the safety feel on the transport system.
