Staff at CrossCountry have cancelled the planned strike for Saturday, 6 December, meaning services will run as usual, though some last-minute cancellations might occur as the operator works to get everything back on track. This is great news for passengers, especially those travelling on the busy Birmingham to Manchester route. RMT, the union behind the strikes, has resolved the action for December, and CrossCountry's Managing Director expressed her excitement about welcoming passengers for the festive season. However, with ongoing engineering work, travellers should still check their journeys beforehand for any alterations. For more details, folks can visit the CrossCountry webpage.
