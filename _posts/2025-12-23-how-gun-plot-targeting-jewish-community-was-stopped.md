Two men, Walid Saadaoui and his brother Bilel, were caught plotting an attack on Manchester's Jewish community, thanks to an undercover operative. Saadaoui, a UK citizen with a past as a hotel entertainer in Tunisia, was linked to terrorist activity via Facebook. The men aimed to acquire weapons and target mass gatherings of Jewish people, having identified key areas in Greater Manchester for their attack. Bilel was found guilty of not reporting the plans. Saadaoui's social media even included a profile picture of a notorious terrorist. Farouk, the operative, was tasked with arranging for weapons to be smuggled into the UK.
