Sam Gardiner's mum, Jo, released a heartfelt statement after an inquest into his tragic death, highlighting his character as "generous, big-hearted and caring." The 24-year-old, known from the BBC series Race Across The World, suffered a fatal brain injury in a road traffic accident in Stockport on May 26. The coroner noted several contributing factors to the crash, including heavy rain and Sam's driving behaviour. Sam's passing has prompted support for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), as he was diagnosed with it after being adopted by Jo and her husband, Andrew. They've launched a JustGiving page to raise awareness and funds for the cause, which has already gathered over Â£28,500. Jo expressed gratitude to those who helped Sam during the crash and hopes that more understanding of FASD will result from this tragedy. The family described Sam as adored and fiercely protective, emphasising the lasting joy and adventurous spirit he brought to their lives.
