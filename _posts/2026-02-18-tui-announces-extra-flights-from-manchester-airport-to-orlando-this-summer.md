TUI is launching extra flights from Manchester Airport to Orlando this summer, starting May 22, with three weekly flights. This comes as Aer Lingus wraps up its long-haul services from Manchester by the end of March. TUI is reacting to growing demand for Orlando, where travellers can easily access Florida's popular spots like Cocoa Beach and Orlando's theme parks. TUI UK & Ireland's Commercial Director, Chris Logan, emphasised the exciting vacation experience Orlando offers for families. Manchester Airport’s Chief Commercial Officer, Stephen Turner, highlighted the airport’s commitment to connecting the North with the world, making the extra flights a positive development for travellers. Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic is increasing its Orlando services this summer and for winter 2026, signalling strong interest in the route after Aer Lingus’s exit. They plan to support passengers impacted by cancellations and welcome former Aer Lingus pilots into their ranks. All in all, it’s shaping up to be a summer filled with opportunities for holiday-makers!
