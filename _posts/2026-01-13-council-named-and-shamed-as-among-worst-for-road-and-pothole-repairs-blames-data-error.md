Bolton Council has been rated poorly for road maintenance, landing in the 'red' category, the lowest rating, among 154 authorities assessed by the government. They attributed this rating to “data errors,” claiming their figures to the Department for Transport (DfT) were incorrectly reported. The council insists it plans to invest £5 million in road maintenance for the upcoming financial year, higher than the previous year's budget. A DfT spokesperson noted that the new traffic light system allows the public to see how effectively councils tackle potholes and maintain roads. The Bolton Conservatives, the opposition, slammed the council's handling of data and highlighted a 42.7% drop in pothole repair funding since Labour regained control, arguing that the council's inability to provide accurate data raises doubts about their competence in managing road repairs.
