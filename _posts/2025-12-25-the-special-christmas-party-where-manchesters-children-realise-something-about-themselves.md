Aurora, a three-year-old with limb difference, recently had a big revelation at a festive party filled with kids just like her. Surrounded by other toddlers, she recognised for the first time that some children, like Teddy, have similar conditions, sparking curiosity about her own. The event, hosted at the Specialised Ability Centre in Wythenshawe, aimed to help kids connect and celebrate their differences, with various activities encouraging inclusive play. Parents appreciated the supportive environment, sharing experiences and concerns, while kids engaged in games designed to improve their skills in a fun way. Aurora's mum, Ella, noted her daughter has adapted well, highlighting the centre's importance in providing customised prosthetics and emotional guidance for families. Other parents, like Kerry and Alex, echoed this sentiment, discussing their children’s progress and opportunities afforded by specialised services. The celebration also allowed for networking among parents, fostering a sense of community. Occupational therapist Macrina summed it up nicely, emphasising that while parties are fun, witnessing the children's growth over time is the real reward.
