Pro-Palestine protests across England have led to several arrests under the Terrorism Act. In Birmingham, 25 protesters were nabbed at a rally in Chamberlain Square, while in Bristol, another 30 were arrested for displaying support for a banned group. Meanwhile, a big protest in London organised by the Palestine Coalition saw around 100,000 people take to the streets. These events come in the wake of Israel's military operation in Gaza, which was triggered by a deadly attack from Hamas on 7 October, resulting in numerous casualties.
