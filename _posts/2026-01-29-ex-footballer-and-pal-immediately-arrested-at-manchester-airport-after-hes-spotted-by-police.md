Two blokes, former footballer Jakub Wrzoskiewicz, 28, and his mate Thomas Brown, 31, got caught trying to smuggle about £88,000 worth of cannabis through Manchester Airport. They landed from Bangkok via Dubai on February 3 last year and were stopped by Border Force officers. Wrzoskiewicz had two suitcases, one containing 40 vacuum-packed parcels of weed weighing 24kg, while Brown had another suitcase with 38 packages weighing 22.07kg.

In court, Wrzoskiewicz claimed he was pressured into smuggling after threats to his family in Thailand, while Brown’s lawyer argued his client faced significant debt that led to risks being posed to him and his family. Despite their claims, both admitted to the charges related to importing a Class B drug. 

Judge Horgan noted the harmful impact of cannabis and acknowledged their efforts toward rehabilitation. Brown received a 22-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, with community service and a curfew, while Wrzoskiewicz got a 14-month suspended sentence, also with community service. Both were ordered to cover court costs.
