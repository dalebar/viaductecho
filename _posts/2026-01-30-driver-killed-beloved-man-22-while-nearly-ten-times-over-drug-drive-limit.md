A driver, Cormac Sale, admitted to causing the death of 22-year-old motorcyclist Spencer Rothwell-Poole after being nearly ten times over the drug driving limit. The crash occurred on Chorley Old Road in Bolton, where Sale’s car collided with Spencer’s motorbike on December 14, 2024. Sale pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving at Bolton Crown Court, but not guilty to driving without insurance, though this point will still be part of the prosecution's case. Judge Jon Close ordered Sale to remain in custody until sentencing next month. Spencer's father, Rick, shared a heartfelt tribute on Facebook, reflecting on his son’s struggles with autism and how riding made him feel free. He described Spencer as not just a family member, but a best friend who is dearly missed.
