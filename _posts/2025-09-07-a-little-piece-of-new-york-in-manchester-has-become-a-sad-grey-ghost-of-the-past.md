Climbing the 55 steps from The Salisbury to Oxford Road station recently stirred up some lovely nostalgia. Memories of racing to catch trains during school holidays flooded back, and despite the sweat of the ascent, the station's beautiful wood-panelled entrance never disappoints. Not much has changed since the last refurb in 1960, and the Art Deco design keeps its charm intact—though the area’s looking a tad shabby nowadays. Upcoming plans for a major overhaul promise to spruce things up, including the former Cornerhouse and Screen One buildings nearby. The council aims to create a proud entryway to the city centre, a much-needed upgrade given the current state which features graffiti and scaffolding. The once-bustling Cornerhouse, a haven for artists and film buffs, has been missed since its closure, leaving a void in Manchester's cultural scene. The nostalgia surrounding it is strong, and with the proposed transformations, there’s hope to blend the old charm with a fresh vision, capturing the spirit of yesteryears while welcoming the future. Let’s hope they seize this chance to revitalise the area!
