Major roads in Prestwich will face closures from Monday to Friday for about nine months as a transport hub is constructed. Fairfax Road and Rectory Lane will be closed to traffic starting October 13, with Fairfax Road closed from Highfield Road to Heys Road/Poppythorn Lane during weekdays from 7am to 5pm, while Rectory Lane will also see similar closures. Weekends will have the roads reopened, starting Friday evenings. The closures aim to allow excavation for new services and complete the travel hub. This project is part of a Â£100m regeneration plan for a new village centre, including a multi-storey car park with 301 spaces and more than 200 new homes. Good progress has been reported, with steel work underway and upcoming milestones in construction. For more details on traffic diversions and planning applications, visit the Public Notices Portal.
