Sale Sharks kicked off the 2025-26 Prem season by clinching a solid 27-10 victory over Gloucester, thanks to a strong second half. The match started off with both teams playing aggressively and closely matched. The deadlock was broken in the 16th minute when Roebuck scored in the corner, despite a controversial knock-on by Ben Curry that was upheld after a TMO review. Sale's lineup featured Carpenter, Roebuck, R. du Preez, Ma'asi-White, O'Flaherty, Ford, Warr, Rodd, Jibulu, Opoku-Fordjour, Van Rhyn (c), Bamber, Vermeulen, B. Curry, and Dugdale.
