Shay Given, former Manchester City player, has apologised for an inappropriate comment he made about Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy on BBC's Final Score. He described Nancy’s brief 33-day stint as an “absolute Holocaust”, a term he later regretted and stated he didn’t fully understand. Given reflected on his ignorance and expressed a desire to learn from the incident. He issued a heartfelt apology to anyone offended and mentioned plans to donate his fee from the show to the Holocaust Educational Trust. The show's presenter, Jason Mohammad, also acknowledged the inappropriate language during the broadcast. Nancy was dismissed following a disappointing start, including a 3-1 defeat to Rangers.
