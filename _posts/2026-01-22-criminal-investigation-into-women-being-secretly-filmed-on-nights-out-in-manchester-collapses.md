A criminal investigation into a man secretly filming women during nights out in Manchester has fallen through due to legal limitations. The man, arrested in late 2024 by Greater Manchester Police for posting these videos online, was bailed as investigations revealed no further prosecutable avenues. This disturbing trend, which started on TikTok, involved women filmed without their consent, often when intoxicated. The content gained traction across various platforms, leading to offensive comments about the women involved. Despite thorough investigations, including forensic examinations, the police have now opted to pursue civil action alongside Manchester City Council and are focused on addressing predatory behaviour through their "Operation Safer Streets." They emphasised the importance of reporting any unsettling experiences on nights out to ensure safety and support for women. Superintendent Nicola Williams reassured the public that tackling such unacceptable behaviour remains a priority. Anyone feeling unsafe is encouraged to contact the police via 101 or the GMP website.
