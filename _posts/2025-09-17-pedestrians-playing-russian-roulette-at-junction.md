A councillor has voiced concerns over pedestrian safety at a busy junction, likening it to "Russian Roulette" due to insufficient safe crossing points. Despite these worries, McCusker noted that an investigation into collision history showed no recurring issues with the junction's layout. This follows an incident on 6 September where two 16-year-old girls were injured in a collision at that very junction. For more updates, you can catch BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow them on social media.
