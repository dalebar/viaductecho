Ancoats barbershop owner Jimmy Kennedy is shutting down his business after 43 years due to severe financial losses from prolonged roadworks on Oldham Road. Initially meant to wrap up in April, the project has been repeatedly delayed and is now expected to finish in winter 2025. With losses of £7,000 over five months, Jimmy cites lack of planning from the council and declining foot traffic as major issues. He’s forced to retire early at 67. Other local businesses are also suffering; P3 Annihilation Eve lost their outdoor seating area to make way for a drainage project, impacting their earnings. Noise from overnight construction has also frustrated residents and contributed to personal issues for locals like Dominic Pritchard. The Manchester council acknowledged the disruptions but claimed the work aims to improve facilities for everyone in the long run. It’s tough times for the local community as they navigate these extensive changes.
