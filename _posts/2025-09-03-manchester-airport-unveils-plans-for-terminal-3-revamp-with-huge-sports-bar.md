Work is now underway to revamp Manchester Airport’s Terminal 3, with the first parts, including a big sports bar called Sporting Chance, set to open early next year. The renovation comes as Terminal 1 closes, freeing up space to enhance passenger experience, adding 40% more seating, better security, and new shops and eateries. Alongside Sporting Chance, an Italian restaurant named Terracotta will also be introduced, both managed by HMSHost UK.

This project follows the recent completion of a massive £1.3bn overhaul of Terminal 2, more than doubling its size and introducing several new shops and facilities, such as a LEGO store, Starbucks, and a food court. The final touches for Terminal 2 will include additional boarding gates and unique design features reminiscent of Terminal 1’s decor.

Manchester Airport's managing director, Chris Woodroofe, expressed enthusiasm about the transformation, aiming to improve the overall experience for passengers. The renovations signal a bright future for Manchester Airport as it continues to connect the North to the world.
