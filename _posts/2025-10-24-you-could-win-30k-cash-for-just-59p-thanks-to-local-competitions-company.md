High Peak Comps is running some cracking Halloween competitions, including a chance to win £30,000 for just 59p! You can enter until 29 October, with the winner announced live on Facebook. There's also the "Grab a Ghost" contest, where participants have hundreds of chances to win from a £100,000 prize pool, including lots of £1,000, all for 99p a ticket. This competition ends on 1 November. 

The company isn’t just about competitions; they’re big on community support too. Recently, they donated various prizes to local charities like Autisk and Just Drop In, and even sponsored a fashion show for The Rossendale Trust. 

High Peak Comps, which started in March 2020, has given away an impressive £10m in prizes and continues to make a positive impact locally. If you’re interested in entering or collaborating on community projects, reach out to them!
