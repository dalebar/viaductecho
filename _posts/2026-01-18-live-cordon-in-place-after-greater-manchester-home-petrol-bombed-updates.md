A Greater Manchester home was targeted in a shocking petrol bomb attack early on January 18 in the Redvales area of Bury. Emergency services, including police and fire crews, arrived on the scene after the family was alerted by a loud noise and discovered their house ablaze. Thankfully, everyone was safe, but local councillor Tamoor Tariq stated the family lost everything, including personal belongings and irreplaceable memories.

The incident is being treated seriously, with a significant police presence in the area for investigations. Councillor Tariq is urging residents nearby to check any CCTV or dashcam footage from around the time of the attack, as even small details could help identify the attackers. He expressed his concern for the shaken family and emphasised that such violence has no place in the community. The house remains cordoned off for forensic investigations, and updates will follow as the situation develops.
