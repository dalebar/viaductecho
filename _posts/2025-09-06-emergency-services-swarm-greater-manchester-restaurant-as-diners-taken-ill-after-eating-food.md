Police were alerted to Dosa Kings on Northenden Road in Sale, Greater Manchester, around 12.40pm today after several diners fell ill, believed to be linked to food consumed there. Emergency services treated customers for minor reactions on-site, but one diner's condition was more serious. Police ruled out a gas leak as the cause. The scene saw a significant emergency response, leading to the temporary closure of Northenden Road while investigations took place. By Saturday evening, police had left, but officials from Trafford Council and the Health and Safety Executive remained to oversee matters. Dosa Kingss has been contacted for a comment regarding the incident, and inquiries are still underway.
