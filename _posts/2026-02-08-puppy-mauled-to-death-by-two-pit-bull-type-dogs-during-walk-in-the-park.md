A heartbroken dog owner has shared his devastating experience after his five-month-old toy poodle, Kola, was mauled by two pit bull-type dogs while on a walk in Langworthy Park, Salford. The tragic incident occurred when the other dogs, not on a lead, chased Kola, leading to fatal injuries including a snapped spine. Despite rushing Kola to the vet, he couldn't be saved. The owner of the aggressive dogs reportedly yelled threats while the attack unfolded. Kola’s owner, a 29-year-old teacher, expressed his utter devastation over the loss, saying he felt helpless to save his pup. His partner added that they are heartbroken and in shock, emphasising Kola's importance in their lives. They fear for others’ safety, urging action against the other dogs and their owner to prevent further incidents. Greater Manchester Police are investigating, and the couple hope for justice for Kola.
