Around 1,900 bus drivers in Greater Manchester are set to strike for three days this week over a pay dispute, affecting Stagecoach and Metroline services. The strike will occur on Friday, Saturday, and next Monday, leading to the cancellation of approximately 190 services, including some school buses, particularly in Tameside, Trafford, and Stockport. Disruptions are also expected in south Manchester and the city centre, with some longer routes in Rochdale impacted. However, services in Bolton, Bury, Salford, and Wigan should run as normal. This decision comes after drivers at First Bus called off their planned strike following a generous 20% pay offer. Uniteâ€™s regional officer has stated that negotiations are ongoing, but unless acceptable offers are presented, further strikes could happen on October 18th, 23rd, and 24th. Transport for Greater Manchester has urged both parties to keep talking to avoid disruption and recommended passengers check service updates before travelling.
