The £17m redevelopment plan for Denton is set to kick off soon, focusing on enhancing public spaces, including better pedestrian and cycling routes and cycle parking. The project is funded by £16.7m in Levelling Up Funding, with nearly £3m already set aside for the Festival Hall and Town Hall repairs. Locals and businesses will have a say in shaping these developments, which aim to improve services, community spaces, and the overall look of Denton. Coun Stephen Homer emphasised the importance of community input for a sustainable future and attracting investment. To gather feedback, there'll be a public drop-in session at the Create Centre in Hyde on September 24 from 12.30pm to 7pm, plus an online survey for those who can’t make it. The goal is to ensure the revamped town centre meets the needs of all residents.
