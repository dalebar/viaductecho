Health leaders in Greater Manchester are encouraging residents to take five important steps to stay well this Christmas, as flu cases rise and NHS services brace for strikes from resident doctors set to begin on December 17. With flu hospitalisations spiking dramatically, residents are advised to prepare early to ease pressure on health services. Key recommendations include: 
1. Check opening hours for GP practices and pharmacies, which will close on certain bank holidays.
2. Order repeat prescriptions a week before Christmas to avoid running out, especially as NHS 111 can get busy during holidays.
3. Familiarise yourself with available services, such as dental helplines and urgent eye care, rather than heading to A&E for non-life-threatening issues.
4. Keep basic cold and flu treatments at home to limit unnecessary NHS visits.
5. Ensure you’re up to date with winter vaccinations, particularly if you’re in a high-risk group.

Additionally, good hygiene practices, like handwashing and wearing masks when symptomatic, are advised to keep everyone safe this festive season.
