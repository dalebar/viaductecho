Exciting plans are underway for a new town on the Rochdale-Bury border, with the green light for 1,550 houses, shops, transport links, and a school. This development will cover 98 hectares near the M60, between Simister and Bowlee. Both councils are working on a framework to ensure the new area integrates well with existing transport networks and neighbouring communities. They’re planning new roads, transport connections, and pedestrian routes as part of a scheme to tackle local housing needs, especially for first-time buyers and key workers. 

This project is part of the GM-wide Places for Everyone initiative, aimed at building thousands of homes across Greater Manchester over the next 20 years. The area, adjacent to employment sites and linked to the larger Atom Valley scheme, is expected to generate around 20,000 skilled jobs in tech and manufacturing. The timeframe includes approval from Bury council after Rochdale’s council cabinet greenlit the plans, with public consultations set to follow. Coun Neil Emmott highlighted its significance for creating jobs and homes in the region.
