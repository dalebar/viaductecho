Wigan town centre in Greater Manchester has been hit with a fifth 48-hour dispersal order in just three weeks, as police aim to tackle rising crime and anti-social behaviour. The first order followed two stabbing incidents, involving a 42-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy, which left them with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. The latest dispersal order, effective from 3pm today until Sunday, allows police to remove anyone suspected of causing trouble in the area. GMP Wigan announced the increase in police presence to help curb these issues. They also encourage people to stay updated with local news through their newsletters and apps. If you’ve got a story idea, they’re all ears!
