At a vigil in Crumpsall for the victims of the Manchester synagogue attack, emotions ran high as community members mourned and expressed anger. Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, which also injured four others. The assailant, Jihad al-Shamie, was shot dead by police. Many in the Jewish community felt both shocked and unsurprised given the rising anti-Semitism in the UK, especially post the October 7 Hamas attack. 

During the vigil, Deputy PM David Lammy faced heavy booing and heckling from attendees who accused the government of enabling anti-Semitism. Tony Levene vocally demanded action, asserting the government had 'rewarded terrorism' and allowed hate to proliferate. Reports indicate a significant rise in anti-Semitic incidents on UK university campuses and elsewhere, raising community concerns. Lammy sought to offer comfort and urged against pro-Palestinian protests, while acknowledging the painful loss. The Prime Minister reaffirmed support for the Jewish community and promised increased security for places of worship.
