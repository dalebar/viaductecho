Strikes have been called off after bus drivers' unions resolved a pay dispute, meaning services won't be disrupted in Greater Manchester as initially planned. The industrial action, set for October 10-13, would have impacted around 1,900 drivers, affecting approximately 190 bus routes, including crucial school services. Tameside, Trafford, and Stockport wouldâ€™ve faced complete service cancellations, just as the Manchester Half Marathon was set to happen on October 12, resulting in substantial road closures.

Transport for Greater Manchester is urging passengers to check their travel plans, especially with the marathon in mind. While most bus services in Bolton, Bury, Salford, and Wigan will run normally, some routes in Rochdale could still see disruptions. Danny Vaughan from Transport for Greater Manchester expressed relief over First Bus staff calling off their strike but highlighted the need for ongoing discussions with Stagecoach and Metroline to avoid future disruptions. Passengers are encouraged to stay updated on service statuses via the Bee Network website.
