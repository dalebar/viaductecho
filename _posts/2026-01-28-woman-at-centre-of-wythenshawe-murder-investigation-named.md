Anam Rafay, a woman in her 30s, has been identified as the victim in a murder investigation in Wythenshawe after emergency services found her unresponsive at a property on Lulworth Gardens. Believed to have been stabbed, she died at the scene. A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in police custody. Neighbours described the street as quiet, with many knowing each other to some extent, and referred to Ms Rafay as a 'lovely person.' A witness recounted how she banged on a nearby door for help before collapsing. Greater Manchester Police emphasised that they don’t believe there's a wider risk to the community and are diligently investigating the incident. A police cordon is still in place while an inquest is expected to follow. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the police.
