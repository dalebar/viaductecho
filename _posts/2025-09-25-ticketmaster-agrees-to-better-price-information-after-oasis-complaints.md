Ticketmaster's been told to be clearer about ticket prices after complaints during Oasis's reunion tour. Following a CMA investigation, they must provide better price info while fans queue online, so people can better anticipate costs.

Meanwhile, Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation are facing legal issues in the US over claims they let brokers scoop up tickets and resell them at inflated prices.
