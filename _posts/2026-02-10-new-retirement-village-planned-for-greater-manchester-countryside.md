A new retirement village is on the cards for Rochdale, featuring 49 apartments and 18 bungalows in the Bamford area, off Norden Road. This development aims to address the local demand for retirement accommodation. The L-shaped apartment block will include gardens, a communal lounge with a kitchenette, and parking for residents and visitors. The bungalows will each have private gardens and two parking spaces. Developers McCarthy Stone have emphasised the project's focus on high-quality, sensitively designed living spaces that blend into the lush surroundings. The scheme is part of the broader Places for Everyone plan, which aims to build thousands of new homes across Greater Manchester in the coming years.
