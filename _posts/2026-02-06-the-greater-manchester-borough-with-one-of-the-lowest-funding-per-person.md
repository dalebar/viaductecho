Bury’s council is grappling with a £14m budget shortfall, stemming from the lowest per-person funding in Greater Manchester—about £1,210 per resident, which is £120 less than average. To tackle this gap, they plan to save £9.5m, raise council tax by 5%, and use £4m from reserves. Much of the budget goes towards social care, with rising demands pushing costs up. The council aims to innovate with workforce changes and reduce reliance on costly temporary housing solutions. Despite financial challenges, Councillor Sean Thorpe emphasises ongoing regeneration projects across the borough, highlighting optimism amidst the tough times—projects funded separately from the council's main budget. The 2026/27 budget proposal will be discussed soon.
