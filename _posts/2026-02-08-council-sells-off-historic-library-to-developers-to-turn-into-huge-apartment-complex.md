Hyde's Victorian-era library has been sold to Hyde Court Ltd, who plan to transform it into a massive apartment complex featuring 102 new flats. The library, which opened in 1899, closed in 2015 and has deteriorated since, suffering vandalism and a fire in 2022. The development will convert the iconic building into one apartment block with 53 units, while two additional blocks will house 34 and 15 flats, respectively. Overall, the project will provide a mix of one, two, and three-bedroom homes along with 72 parking spaces. Tameside Council is optimistic about the redevelopment, seeing it as a vital step in enhancing Hyde's town centre and preserving the building's heritage. Hyde Court Ltd is keen to maintain the library's historic charm while offering modern, sustainable housing, and they hope this venture will inspire further investment in the area.
