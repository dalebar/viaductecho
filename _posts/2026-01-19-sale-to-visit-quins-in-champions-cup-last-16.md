Bath will take on Saracens in the last 16 of the Investec Champions Cup, while Harlequins, after a brilliant away win against La Rochelle, will host Sale Sharks. In other matchups, Bordeaux faces Leicester Tigers, with the winner set to meet either Toulouse or Bristol Bears in the quarter-finals. Harlequins' victory has set Ronan O'Gara's team up for a Challenge Cup clash against Newcastle Red Bulls. The quarter-finals will also see Montpellier or Perpignan go up against Connacht or Sharks. Home advantage is crucial for success in these knockout stages!
