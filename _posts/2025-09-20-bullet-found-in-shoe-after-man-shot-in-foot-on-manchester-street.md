Armed officers rushed to an east Manchester estate after a 22-year-old man was shot in the foot on Highgate Crescent in Gorton early this morning (September 20). Fortunately, the injury was just a graze, and the shooter remains unidentified, having fled the scene. A police cordon is set up around Highgate Crescent and nearby Wayland Road, with forensic teams searching the area for evidence. Police have stated that thereâ€™s no connection between this shooting and two others earlier in the week in Newton Heath. A significant police presence continues as investigations proceed, and no arrests have been made so far.
