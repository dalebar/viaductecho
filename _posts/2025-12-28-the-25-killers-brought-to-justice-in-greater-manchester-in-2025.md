Manchester's crown courts are bustling with cases of severe violence, including many homicide trials from 2025. The Manchester Evening News highlights 25 recent killers sentenced for murder or manslaughter, showcasing a mix of tragic circumstances and shocking brutality. 

In a notable case, Osagie Harrison Aimiyekagbon, affectionately known as Harry, was fatally stabbed by Samuel Opokiti, a man he’d previously reported to the police for threats. Opokiti, found to have schizophrenia, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was committed to a secure hospital. 

Another case involved Peter Pitt, who strangled his ex-partner Charlene Mills, convinced she was trying to poison him. He was sentenced to a psychiatric hospital following his plea of diminished responsibility. 

A series of road rage-related and domestic violence cases led to life sentences for multiple assailants, reflecting a grim pattern of aggression in the region. These stories serve as a reminder of the complexities and tragic outcomes surrounding violent crime, impacting not just victims but their families and communities.
