A council in Greater Manchester, Bolton, has said a "data error" is behind its poor reputation for potholes. They claimed the Department for Transport's rating mistakenly reflected highway spending up to June 2025 instead of the full financial year's budget.

The RAC noted that rough roads result in numerous accidents, injuries, and vehicle damages like broken suspension and distorted wheels.
