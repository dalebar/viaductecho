Police made a stunning discovery at Manchester Airport when they stopped a passenger with oversized hand luggage last May. Inside his bag, they found five gold bars, leading to a seizure under the Proceeds of Crime Act due to suspicions of criminal activity. The case, heard on February 19 at Manchester Magistrates' Court, resulted in the largest forfeiture order ever for GMP, valued at £1.81 million. Half of this sum will be used for the ARIS fund, which reinvests money recovered from crime back into local communities. Detective Inspector Sarah Langley emphasized GMP’s commitment to combating money laundering and dismantling the networks supporting organised crime. The civil recovery investigation has concluded, allowing authorities to seize assets linked to unlawful conduct without needing a criminal conviction. The message remains clear: GMP will continue to pursue and confiscate any hidden funds tied to crime.
