Manchester Airport is keen to expand its Asia network after seeing record passenger numbers—over 520,000 last year, a significant increase from 363,000 the year before. This marks a major rise from just 90,000 passengers in 2013, when the Manchester China Forum launched. Airlines like Hainan and Juneyao have boosted flights to Beijing and Shanghai, while Norse Atlantic introduced Manchester's first direct link to Bangkok last November. Singapore Airlines is also in the spotlight, celebrating 40 years of service with regular flights to Changi. Stephen Turner, the airport's Chief Commercial Officer, expressed pride in connecting the North with the world and emphasised their commitment to future growth in Asian routes, highlighting the ongoing demand for travel there. He's thankful to everyone choosing Manchester as their departure point and sends best wishes for a joyful Year of the Horse!
