Young homeless folks in Manchester, aged 18-25, are spending nights in places like McDonald’s and train stations, often while holding down jobs. According to Centrepoint, a youth homeless charity, around 20% of their cases involve employed young people. Case worker Amy Campbell notes many are "hidden" and might sofa-surf or sleep in public spaces to avoid visibility. Factors like family breakdowns and insecure work are significant contributors to their plight. Zero-hour contracts often leave them better off on benefits than in unstable jobs, making it tough to secure stable housing. 

Centrepoint is ramping up its efforts to help at-risk youth sooner with initiatives like family mediation and housing advice. They've partnered with Co-op Bank to create apprenticeships that could lead to permanent jobs. However, Campbell emphasises the critical need for improved mental health services, as delays can hinder recovery and worsen situations. It typically takes months or even years to really turn lives around, with some still spending nights at McDonald's tables until a stable home is found.
