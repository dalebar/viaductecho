A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a disturbance in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, left four people injured early on November 30. The incident occurred around 3.20am on Railway Street. A man in his 20s suffered serious facial injuries, while a 21-year-old is in serious but stable condition with a chest wound. Two others, a 51-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman, sustained minor injuries. The suspect, a 24-year-old from Partington, remains in custody. Police are seeking witnesses to an altercation before the suspect fled towards Altrincham Interchange. The area is cordoned off, with forensics collecting evidence, and CCTV footage reviewed. Despite speculation linking the incident to a nearby hotel housing asylum seekers, police have stated there's no connection. Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Dixon urged anyone with information to reach out and reassured the community that this incident appears isolated. Officers will continue their presence in Altrincham as investigations proceed.
