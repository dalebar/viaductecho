A shop in Newton Heath, Retro Menswear, was raided in 2023, leading to the seizure of counterfeit goods worth £150,000. Following a tip-off, Manchester City Council's Trading Standards employed an undercover tester who purchased fake items, including a Chanel handbag. In August 2023, police seized 1,520 fake products, including clothing and football shirts. The shop's director, Hamza Ali Ahmed, was arrested and charged with 21 counts of possessing goods with false trademarks. He blamed another person for the counterfeit sales, claiming they had fled to Portugal. Ahmed received an 18-month suspended prison sentence at Manchester Crown Court on October 2, along with 100 hours of unpaid work and a £1,328 victim surcharge. The counterfeit goods are set to be destroyed. Councillor Lee-Ann Igbon praised the operation, emphasising the council's dedication to tackling counterfeit trade in the city.
