Harry Styles is set to perform a special "One Night Only" gig at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester on 6 March, celebrating his upcoming album, Kiss All The Time. Disco Occasionally. Tickets are reportedly priced at £20 and will be released through a request process this weekend. The singer will also perform at the Brit Awards a week earlier on 28 February, where his show caused the venue's website to crash due to high traffic. Styles, a Cheshire lad and Co-op Live arena shareholder, is gearing up for his Together Together world tour starting in May, which includes shows at iconic venues like Wembley Stadium. While some fans are buzzing about the affordable tickets for this Manchester gig, others have voiced disappointment over the pricier general concert tickets, which range from £44.10 to £466.25. Styles last performed at the Brits in 2023, winning four awards. Keep an eye on his social media for updates!
