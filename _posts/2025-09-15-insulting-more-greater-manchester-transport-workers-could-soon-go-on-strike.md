Bus travel in Greater Manchester is facing disruption as around 200 Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) workers may join 2,000 bus staff striking over a "disrespectful" 3.2% pay offer, which is deemed insufficient given current RPI inflation at 4.8%. The strikes are set to affect two-thirds of local services, coinciding with major events, including a Manchester United match and concerts. Many workers involved, including those from Unite and Unison, have rejected recent pay proposals, stating they don’t address the ongoing cost of living crisis. Unite’s general secretary labelled the offer a pay cut disguised as a raise, demanding a fair deal for staff. The ballot for action closes on October 1, and while bus operators express disappointment over the strike decision, they've indicated an openness to discussions. During the strike, passengers can use their bus passes on Metrolink trams. TfGM officials are urging operators to negotiate and avoid passenger disruption.
