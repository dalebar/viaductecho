A new independent florist, 'Sweet Bud', is set to open in the outdoor section of Merseyway shopping centre this Autumn, making it the first of its kind in Stockport town centre for years. Founded by Olivia Woodward, who previously operated in Levenshulme, Sweet Bud has built a reputation for stunning floral designs at events and weddings, even collaborating with renowned names like the BBC and Old Trafford cricket ground. Olivia is excited about the move, saying Stockport has transformed into a lively hub for independent businesses and felt like the perfect place for her shop. The centre manager, Victoria Nichol, highlighted how Sweet Bud will enhance Merseyway's mix of tenants, bringing a creative flair to the area and supporting Stockport's growing retail scene. Cllr Micheala Meikle also welcomed the new arrival, stressing the importance of diverse independent shops in making Stockport a vibrant destination. Sweet Bud will offer deliveries across Stockport and Manchester.
