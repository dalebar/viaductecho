A new waste recovery centre is on the cards for Greater Manchester, specifically in Bolton, replacing the current Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) at Longley Lane, Sharston. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) has filed a planning application for this upgraded facility at the old in-vessel composting site on Salford Road, Over Hulton. If greenlit, the new centre will handle around 140,000 tonnes of recyclable waste annually, significantly increasing capacity from the existing MRF, which processes about 90,000-100,000 tonnes. The revamped site aims to recycle more materials, like plastics and Tetra Pak cartons, which weren’t managed at Longley Lane. Spanning roughly 3.7 hectares and nestled in an industrial area, the site will have a one-way access system for HGVs and even include an education centre with a viewing platform. Local planners are set to review the proposals soon.
