Officers from Greater Manchester Police raided homes in Oldham on September 24 as part of an investigation into historical child sexual exploitation under Operation Sherwood. Five suspects, aged 38 to 51, were arrested on suspicion of child rape, with the allegations stemming from offences reported by two survivors between 2011 and 2014. This follows earlier arrests this month in Longsight and Rochdale, as well as previous arrests in August and September related to historical sexual offences. In total, 21 suspects have been arrested so far. Detective Superintendent Alan Clitherow emphasised the ongoing commitment to pursuing justice for survivors, asserting that time won't hinder their efforts. He encouraged anyone affected by abuse to come forward, promising support throughout the process.
