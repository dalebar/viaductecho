Greater Manchester Police are ramping up patrols to ensure safety for Jewish communities in light of an antisemitic attack at Bondi Beach, Australia, which left twelve people dead. With Hanukkah celebrations starting on Sunday, police are coordinating with event organisers to enhance security during the festivities. They reassured locals about their safety measures and urged anyone with concerns to approach officers on duty. 

The Metropolitan Police and Police Scotland are also increasing their presence around synagogues and Jewish venues, encouraging vigilance without causing alarm. The attack has prompted expressions of solidarity from the British Jewish community, with the Board of Deputies reaching out to their Australian counterparts. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, highlighting that Hanukkah is a time for joy and reaffirming support for the Jewish community. Overall, there's a strong focus on community safety and collaboration with law enforcement during this sensitive time.
