Tributes are flowing in for Itzik Alterman, a beloved Holocaust survivor and elder of the Jewish community, who passed away at 97. Known as Ike, he survived four Nazi camps and received the British Empire Medal in 2023 for his dedication to Holocaust education. A gifted speaker, Ike inspired many and documented his experiences through books via the Prestwich charity The Fed’s My Voice project. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham fondly recalls meeting Ike in 2020, noting his warmth, humour, and remarkable resilience despite the horrors he witnessed. Ike’s story as a 'Windermere Boy' – a group of Jewish children rescued from concentration camps – highlights the triumph of the human spirit. He used his experiences to connect with young people, conveying a powerful message: "Hate is a disease." Celebrated for his positivity, Ike’s life is a testament to love over hate and the welcoming spirit of Manchester. He leaves behind a legacy that will be cherished by many.
