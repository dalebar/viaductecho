A family from Greater Manchester, Dean Hunt, Anna, and their kids—Harlow, Lennox, and Ziggy—are about to embark on a world tour after quitting their jobs, selling their car, and renting their home. They're setting off to Thailand next month, feeling it’s time to open their children’s eyes to the world. Dean, 40, a plumber, and Anna, 39, an NHS paediatric nurse, both seek to expose their kids to different cultures and experiences, believing there's much to learn outside traditional classrooms.

While some school parents think they’re 'mad,' they’ve got solid support from family for this 'massive risk.' The couple has a plan to travel through several countries, including Vietnam and Bali, in a converted campervan. Dean aims to show that life’s more than grinding 9-to-5 jobs, especially given their concerns about crime and safety back home. They’ll document their journey on social media to inspire others, emphasising that children can learn invaluable life skills through travel. You can follow their adventures on Instagram at @family_against_the_norm.
