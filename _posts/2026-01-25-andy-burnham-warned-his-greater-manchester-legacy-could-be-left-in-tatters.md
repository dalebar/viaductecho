George Osborne pointed out a gap in political influence versus economic significance for Northern cities back in 2014, proposing the idea of metro mayors for areas like Greater Manchester. Fast forward nearly 12 years, Greater Manchester's economy has transformed into one of the UK's fastest-growing, owing much to prior leadership under Howard Bernstein and Richard Leese. Mayor Andy Burnham is now viewed as a key Labour figure as he highlights the region's successes while admitting they stem from long-term local effort. His initiatives like the Bee Network for public transport and the Greater Manchester baccalaureate aim to connect young people to job opportunities in the booming city. However, challenges like housing shortages and child poverty remain pressing. While Burnham has made significant contributions, like advocating for public transport and regeneration projects, critics warn he risks leaving unfinished business if he moves to Parliament. Both sides of the political aisle acknowledge his capabilities, with calls for him to continue championing devolution and local empowerment, as he could be a strong candidate in the upcoming Denton by-election.
