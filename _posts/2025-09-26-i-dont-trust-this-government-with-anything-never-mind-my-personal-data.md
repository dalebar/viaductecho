Opinions were mixed in Manchester city centre regarding the governmentâ€™s recent announcement that digital ID cards will be mandatory for work. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that these free, digitally-stored IDs will replace traditional forms of identification to demonstrate the right to work, aiming to tackle illegal immigration and streamline access to services. However, many locals expressed concerns over privacy. Freddie, 24, feared it was a means of government surveillance, similar to restrictions under the Online Safety Act. Others shared similar sentiments, stressing that privacy is becoming increasingly precious. Older residents voiced skepticism about the scheme's accessibility, while younger ones debated its necessity, with some seeing potential benefits in streamlined processes. The general sentiment leaned towards caution and distrust of government intentions, with critiques of the effectiveness of such measures in genuinely addressing illegal immigration. As the digital age progresses with cashless transactions, many worry about the implications of surveillance and loss of personal freedoms.
