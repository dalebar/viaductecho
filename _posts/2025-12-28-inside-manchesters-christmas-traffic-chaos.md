The festive season has led to intense traffic chaos in Manchester, particularly around city centre hotspots like Deansgate and Chapel Street. Roads have been gridlocked due to a surge in car usage—16% higher than 12 years ago—combined with a spike in people visiting the area for Christmas markets and events. Complaints have flooded social media about the city feeling like a massive car park, with delays affecting taxis and trams alike. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) has been proactively managing the situation, with traffic light adjustments and temporary park and ride initiatives to alleviate congestion. They've noted that holiday crowds peak during evening events, making road conditions particularly tricky. While congestion is frustrating, some reports indicate overall journey speeds have actually improved compared to the previous year. TfGM emphasises planning ahead when driving into the city and encourages the use of public transport, as many visitors unfamiliar with public transport options are choosing to drive. Meanwhile, ongoing roadworks and a one-way system aimed at improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists have also contributed to delays.
