This weekend in Stockport, brace yourself for typical autumn vibes with a mix of clouds and rain. Friday kicks off with showers, hitting highs of 10°C and lows around 5°C, so keep that raincoat handy! Saturday will see a slight drop in temperature, peaking at 7°C and dropping to 4°C, with increased humidity and less wind. Sunday wraps up the weekend with more clouds, a chilly start at 0°C, and a chance of light rain in the morning before it clears up.

For those commuting, be mindful of wet roads and plan for extra travel time. It’s a good weekend for indoor activities, but if you fancy some fresh air, aim for late afternoons when rain's less likely. Stay warm and have a lovely weekend!
