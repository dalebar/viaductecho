This week, Greater Manchester will see seven motorways and four major A-roads undergoing closures, starting from Monday, February 2. National Highways has released a report highlighting closures for six motorways, including the M6, M60, M61, M62, M602, and M67, primarily overnight from 9pm to 6am. The A-roads affected are the A34, A56, and A666.

Notably, expect closures at key junctions and slip roads, which may impact night owls and early commuters alike. Additional details outline various specific closures on the motorways, such as at junctions 5 to 6 on M6 and multiple closures on the M60, like between junctions 1 and 12, affecting both clockwise and anti-clockwise lanes.

So, if you're planning to hit the road, it might be wise to check the full list and plan an alternative route to avoid any hassle. Safe travels!
