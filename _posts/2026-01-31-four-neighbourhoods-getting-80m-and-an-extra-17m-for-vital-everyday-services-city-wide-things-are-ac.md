Manchester council is engaging residents to decide how to spend up to £80m aimed at enhancing four key neighbourhoods – Clayton Vale, South Gorton, South Benchill, and Central Wythenshawe, plus South Harpurhey and Monsall. This initiative is part of the ‘Pride of Place’ fund, with a survey being rolled out to gather public suggestions. The council aims to use the funds for various projects like infrastructure development, public safety improvements, and cultural initiatives. Alongside this, the council's budget has surpassed £1bn for the first time, boosted by unexpected government funding. An additional £17m is set for neighbourhood improvements, including increasing street cleaning, combating fly-tipping, and enhancing public spaces. Also on the agenda are better access to sports, funding for community events, and support for local high streets. Council leader Bev Craig emphasised the importance of community involvement in shaping local spending, highlighting this as a significant opportunity for residents to impact their surroundings for generations.
