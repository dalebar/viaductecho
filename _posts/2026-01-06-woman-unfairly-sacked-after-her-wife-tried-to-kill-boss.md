An ambulance worker, Paula Smith, was unfairly dismissed after her wife attempted to kill their operations manager with a hammer. The tribunal found that her dismissal was unjust, as the trust in the service was not sufficiently undermined by her association with the crime. The incident was a fallout from a personal tragedy in July 2022 when a patient they knew died, and they couldn't attend the funeral due to work commitments. On 3 April 2024, Greater Manchester Police confirmed that they would not pursue the case further and lifted Paula’s bail conditions.
