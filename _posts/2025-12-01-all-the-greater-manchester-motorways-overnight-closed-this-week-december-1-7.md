From December 1-7, 2025, six motorways in Greater Manchester—M6, M56, M60, M61, M62, and M66—will have overnight closures for maintenance. National Highways has announced this, and with Christmas traffic ramping up, the city centre will be busier than usual, particularly during the weekend. Concerts at Co-op Live featuring Ed Sheeran and Jamiroquai, along with events at AO Arena like Pete Tong and Madness, are expected to draw large crowds. Plus, Manchester United's match against West Ham on December 4 and Manchester City playing Sunderland on December 6 will add to the congestion. Red Devils fans should particularly note the motorway closures on Thursday, as they coincide with the match timing. Motorists are advised to plan ahead to avoid delays.
