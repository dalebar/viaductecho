A proposal for a new 24-hour bingo and slot machine venue by Merkur Slots in Bolton has been turned down. The planned site, a vacant shop on Newport Street that used to be Bonmarche, faced rejection due to concerns over the impact on the town centre's vibrancy. The town centre manager highlighted that the area already has a high number of adult gambling establishments, which could deter families and shoppers. The proposal aimed to create up to 12 jobs and offered low-stakes gaming options, distinguishing itself from typical betting shops. Currently, three out of 45 retail units on Newport Street are already adult gaming centres. The planning appeal will be reviewed in the coming weeks amid growing calls for councils to have more power over gambling establishments.
