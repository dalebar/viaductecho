Chadderton Town Hall in Oldham is giving couples a chance to win a free wedding ceremony during their wedding fair on Sunday, January 25. The fair, featuring 20 exhibitors showcasing everything from flowers to photography and attire, is free to attend. Springhill Hospice will also present a selection of wedding attire, including new or unworn gowns at reduced prices. The stunning Grade-II listed baroque hall has been hosting weddings since 2005 and has seen nearly 8,000 couples say "I do." With its impressive interior, iconic staircase, and various ceremony spaces, Chadderton Town Hall aims to elevate its profile amidst a trend of simple, elegant town hall weddings. The lucky winners of the draw will save around £475 on their ceremony, with options for an additional reception.
