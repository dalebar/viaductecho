The leader of Stockport council, Mark Roberts, slammed plans for a massive new town with 20,000 homes near Stockport, comparing it to someone in Westminster randomly selecting land. This proposal aims to address England's housing demand but has local leaders worried itâ€™ll overload existing services and infrastructure in Stockport, as future residents may commute through the area. Tom Morrison, the local Lib Dem MP, highlighted the lack of consultation and potential strain on roads and public transport.

Conservative councillor Peter Crossen echoed these concerns, stressing the impact on schools and healthcare. The Stockport Labour Group defended the government's approach, arguing it addresses the housing crisis affecting many families. They claim the Labour government is committed to building new homes, while the Lib Dems are working on a local development plan amidst high housing targets from the government. Concerns remain about speculative developments threatening the green belt, with calls for a cohesive local strategy.
