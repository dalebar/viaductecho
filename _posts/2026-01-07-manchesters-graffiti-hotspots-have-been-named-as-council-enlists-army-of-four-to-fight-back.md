Manchester has identified its top graffiti hotspots, with nearly half of all reports—1,878 last year—coming from just two areas: Piccadilly (482 incidents) and Deansgate (309). Withington, Cheetham, and Higher Blackley are also among the worst hit. In response, the council has launched a major initiative to combat graffiti, hiring four staff and spending £17,000 on significant interventions, including a notable clean-up at Slate Wharf. They're working with film companies for funding and using volunteer efforts to repaint areas like the Bromley Street underpass.

The council's strategy is proactive, involving community protection orders, identifying perpetrators, and providing residents with cleaning kits. However, there's a concern that cleaned sites tend to attract new tags quickly. Coun Mandie Shilton Godwin stressed the need for ongoing efforts as the city prepares to invest in street cleaning. While recognising the artistic value of graffiti, the council urges residents to report uncommissioned graffiti through their website to maintain Manchester's vibrant character.
