Today in Stockport, expect partly cloudy skies with a cool high of 8°C and a low of 4°C later on. The humidity's sitting at 86%, so it’ll feel a bit damper, and there's a 39% chance of light rain, so best to have an umbrella handy. Winds will be brisk, hitting speeds of around 20mph, which will add a chill to the air.

If you're commuting, keep an eye out for those potential showers and prepare for the blustery conditions—allow for some extra time if you're cycling or walking. Layer up and wear a warm coat to stay comfy, and if you fancy a stroll, make sure you’re wrapped up well. If staying in sounds more appealing, it’s perfect for some indoor activities. Enjoy your day, whatever you decide!
