Plans to build 200 homes on Mirrlees Fields in Hazel Grove, Stockport, have been approved despite strong opposition from locals. The development includes a 'large public open space' and is near Woodsmoor train station and Stepping Hill Hospital. After years of protests and a petition with over 5,000 signatures against the project due to concerns about congestion and the loss of green space, the planning decision was initially denied in December 2022. However, a subsequent appeal overturned this decision in January 2024. Former Councillor Tom Morrison, now an MP, expressed disappointment at the approval, highlighting community efforts to protect the cherished land. Kellen Homes and Great Places Housing Group will provide a mix of affordable one, two, three, and four-bedroom homes. The developers aim to combine new housing with preserved open space, enhancing the local environment for future generations.
