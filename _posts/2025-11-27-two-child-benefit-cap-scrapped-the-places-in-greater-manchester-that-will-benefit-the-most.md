The recent decision to lift the two-child benefit limit will benefit over 111,000 children in Greater Manchester, as charities applaud Rachel Reeves’ move to abolish this cap. The limit, introduced by the Conservatives in 2018, restricted parents from claiming Child Tax Credit or Universal Credit for more than two children, affecting around 469,780 households across Great Britain. It’s estimated that this change will cost £3bn annually by 2029-30 and could lift 350,000 children out of poverty nationwide. In Greater Manchester, constituencies like Blackley, Middleton South, and Salford saw around 28% of children impacted by the limit. In comparison, areas such as Cheadle and Altrincham had only 5% affected. While Manchester has significant figures, some of the most severely impacted areas are outside the region, with Hackney North and Stoke Newington having a staggering 42% of its children affected. Overall, the change is a big step towards easing burdens for families struggling under the previous policy.
