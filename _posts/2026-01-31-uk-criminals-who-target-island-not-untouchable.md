Two men from Failsworth, Kane Jones and Thomas Lindop, have received hefty jail sentences for their roles in a Manchester crime gang's drug smuggling scheme. They were caught attempting to transport £49,000 worth of cocaine to the Isle of Man via ferry in February 2025, receiving sentences of 10 years and 8 years, respectively. Detective Inspector Jamie Tomlinson emphasised that these sentences show that UK criminals aren’t "untouchable." 

A third accomplice, Scott Goulden from Warrington, also faced nine years for the same operation. Evidence, including fingerprints and voice messages, linked Jones and Lindop to the drug package. The police conducted a search under an international warrant, resulting in their capture. 

Tomlinson highlighted the excellent collaboration between law enforcement agencies, stating they’d keep going after those involved in drug importation. He noted the personal cost to the criminals, as they would now be separated from their families for significant periods.
