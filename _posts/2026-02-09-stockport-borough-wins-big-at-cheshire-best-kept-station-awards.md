Stockport has shone brightly at the Cheshire Best Kept Station Awards, with six local stations earning accolades. Romiley snagged the top spot as Cheshire's Best Kept Station for 2025, while Rose Hill took home the Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) award. Heaton Chapel received a highly-commended mention from TfGM, and Marple was recognised as the Best Staffed Station. Stockport itself won the Art Project award, with Reddish South also receiving a commendation in the same category. Mark Barker, chair of the awards, praised the community efforts in enhancing these stations, emphasising their importance as gateways for journeys and connections. The winners were chosen by a panel of 20 judges, including former railway staff and regular passengers, who evaluated the stations during summer visits.
