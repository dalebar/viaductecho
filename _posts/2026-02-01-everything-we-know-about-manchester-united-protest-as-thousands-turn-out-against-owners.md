Manchester United fans, spearheaded by The 1958 group, staged a major protest against Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos, and the Glazer family before the Fulham match. The gathering kicked off from two spots—Sir Matt Busby Way and Hotel Football—before uniting at The Trinity Statue outside Old Trafford. The protest stemmed from frustration over ticket prices and the treatment of long-time season ticket holders, despite recent improvements on the pitch under Michael Carrick. Fans feel the proposed 100,000-seater stadium is a distraction from deeper issues regarding ownership. Thousands joined the peaceful demonstration, filling the area with smoke, banners, and chants aimed at Ratcliffe and the Glazers, as police maintained order. The 1958 accused Ratcliffe of allowing the Glazers to continue their reign and bemoaned 21 years of mismanagement. Carrick acknowledged the fans' right to protest, underscoring the connection between the team and supporters. Organisers anticipated over 6,000 participants, making it a significant event in the fight for change at the club.
