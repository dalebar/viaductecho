Over 400 new homes are proposed around Stockport, including a plan for 250 homes near Windlehurst Road in High Lane, close to the Macclesfield Canal. Persimmon Homes has outlined a masterplan for the area, featuring open spaces and access routes to local amenities. Meanwhile, up to 195 homes are being considered on green belt land off Lytham Drive in Bramhall, with half designated as affordable housing. Both projects are in the early stages, undergoing environmental impact assessments before formal applications are lodged. Stockport’s wider vision includes a target of 25,000 new homes by 2042, potentially redeveloping selected green belt areas as part of a draft local plan now open for public consultation until December 21.
