Passengers at Manchester Airport's revamped Terminal 2 can now enjoy the new high-end shopping area, the Boutique Mall, which features the airport's first Fever Tree Cocktail and Champagne Bar. This £1.3 billion transformation is nearly complete, with most areas of the departure lounge now open. Exciting luxury brands like Chanel and Jo Malone are set to join next year. A new World Duty Free store has also launched, adding trendy fragrance and beauty lines. A few eateries are yet to open, including the airport's first Wetherspoons and the Great Northern Market, expected early next year. The arrivals hall has welcomed new WHSmith, Costa, and Greggs outlets, the latter giving away free sausage rolls to early customers. While Ryanair remains the only airline in Terminal 3, there are plans to further enhance the airport's facilities, including a new sports bar. Airport Managing Director Chris Woodroofe highlighted these developments as part of a decade-long commitment, anticipating a vibrant 2026 for travellers.
