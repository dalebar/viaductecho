The Manchester Half Marathon, a beloved event in the city's calendar for nearly ten years, features a vibrant 13.1-mile (21km) route. Runners, both elite and non-elite, kick off at the A56 near Victoria Warehouse before winding through areas like Stretford, Sale, and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, with the finish at Talbot Road offering lovely views of the city centre.

Road closures will begin on Saturday as preparations ramp up, and the tram network is your best bet for getting to and from the event. You can expect to see familiar faces along the route, including former Lioness Christiansen.
