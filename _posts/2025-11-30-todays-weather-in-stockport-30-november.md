On Sunday in Stockport, expect a shift from clear skies to overcast conditions, with rain likely by late afternoon. It’ll start off chilly at around 1°C, warming up to a maximum of 7°C but still feeling brisk. Humidity will be high at 83%, so it’ll be quite damp. Winds will gust up to 17 mph, adding a wind chill factor to the day’s chilliness.

For those commuting, be prepared for potential delays as the weather changes, especially with the forecasted rain and wind possibly making roads slippery. Best to carry rain gear and set off a bit earlier.

Make the most of the clear morning for outdoor plans, dress in layers to stay warm, and don’t forget your umbrella for the afternoon showers!
