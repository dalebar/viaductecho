Repairs to the Bridgewater Canal in Cheshire, damaged by last year's flooding, are on track for completion by the end of 2026. Stabilisation works are nearly finished, with embankment reinstatement set to start in summer 2026. The Bridgewater Canal Company has brought in SLR Consulting to oversee the design and project management of these repairs. Various protective measures have already been implemented, reducing the closed-off area to under half a mile. An environmental report confirmed that flood-affected soils aren't a health risk, paving the way for further surveys. Subsequent ecological assessments are planned, which will help kick off the contractor selection process. Peter Parkinson, managing director of the Bridgewater Canal Company, emphasised the canal's importance to the community and expressed confidence in SLR Consulting's expertise for this project. Updates will be provided as plans progress.
