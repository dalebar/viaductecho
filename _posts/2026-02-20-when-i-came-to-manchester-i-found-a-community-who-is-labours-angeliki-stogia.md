Angeliki Stogia, originally from Arta, Greece, moved to Manchester 30 years ago for her studies and has embraced the city ever since. Now a naturalised British citizen and a councillor since 2012, she’s vying for the Gorton and Denton seat. Stogia is known for her local insight from her experience on the Manchester Council’s executive committee, supporting community projects like the pedestrianisation of Deansgate and the Levenshulme walking and cycling scheme. With endorsements from big names like Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, she’s advocating for local issues such as improving GP access and addressing infrastructure concerns like station accessibility. Stogia emphasises her commitment to her constituents and aims to promote a campaign of unity. Despite the national challenges facing Labour, her strong local ties and hands-on approach may resonate with voters as she seeks to make a real difference in her community.
