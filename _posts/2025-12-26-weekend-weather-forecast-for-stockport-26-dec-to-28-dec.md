This weekend's weather in Stockport looks pretty decent, with mainly dry conditions and cool temperatures. Friday kicks off with clear skies and a sunny vibe, hitting around 7°C during the day, though it’ll feel a bit nippy with a 20 mph breeze. Saturday will be only slightly warmer at 8°C and partly cloudy, while Sunday brings more clouds but also pleasant conditions with highs of 7°C. Humidity rises throughout the weekend, peaking at 82% on Sunday, but no rain’s on the horizon, so it’s perfect for outdoor fun!

Commuting should be a breeze, but keep in mind the winds on Friday if you’re cycling or walking, especially in open spots. Overall, it’s a great time for hikes, visits to the park, or just getting outside. Just don’t forget to wrap up warm!
