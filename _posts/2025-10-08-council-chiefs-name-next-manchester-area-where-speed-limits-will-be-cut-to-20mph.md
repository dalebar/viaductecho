Wythenshawe is set to be the next area in Manchester to adopt a 20mph speed limit on residential roads, following the council’s move to reduce speeds from 30mph to 20mph in residential areas. This decision comes after a concerning rise in road injuries and fatalities, with serious incidents increasing by 50% from 2019 to 2023. Kevin Gillham from the council mentioned that while main roads will now have a 30mph limit, the focus is on standardising the 20mph limit across most of the city, as about 70% of Manchester’s roads already follow this speed. Catriona Swanson, the council lead for sustainable transport, shared that funding has been secured for active travel improvements in Wythenshawe, with plans to ensure that the transition won't negatively impact journey times. As Wythenshawe moves forward, other parts of the city will also be evaluated for additional 20mph zones in the near future.
