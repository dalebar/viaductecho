Councillors in Stockport are raising concerns about illegal parking, fly-tipping, and anti-social behaviour, calling it a ‘blight’ on local neighbourhoods. During an October 10 council meeting, a motion was passed to review how to enhance enforcement across the borough. Issues highlighted include widespread illegal parking near Edgeley Park football stadium, which is causing hazards for pedestrians. Edgeley councillor Asa Caton emphasized the need for stronger enforcement and collaboration with Greater Manchester Police to address these problems. Residents have expressed frustration over reporting issues with little action taken, eroding their confidence in the council. Additionally, there are concerns regarding developers not adhering to agreements, especially noted at Chester Road and Springmount Mill. In response, Dan Oliver, the council’s cabinet member for communities, highlighted that enforcement is indeed happening, citing over 23,000 parking fines issued last year, which is an increase from previous years. The councillors agreed on the need for tougher enforcement measures going forward.
