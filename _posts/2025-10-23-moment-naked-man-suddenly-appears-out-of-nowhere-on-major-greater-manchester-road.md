In Bury, a bizarre incident unfolded when a naked man was caught on camera attacking cars and attempting to open a van door on Rochdale Road. Police were alerted yesterday morning, October 22, after reports of his aggressive behaviour. Marley Trippier, a 20-year-old scaffolder, recorded the shocking moment as the man slapped passing cars and banged on a silver van before causing traffic to halt. Marley, riding with his dad and step mum, described it as an unexpected and disturbing sight. Thankfully, police confirmed that a 25-year-old man has been detained and taken to hospital following the incident.
