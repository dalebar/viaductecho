A recent protest on Manchester's Curry Mile led to several arrests as crowds gathered for a second night. Police were present in large numbers around 11pm on Wednesday night, giving dispersal orders to some individuals. This followed a mostly peaceful demonstration related to ongoing clashes in Syria between the government and Kurdish-led forces. The protests were sparked by concerns over the situation in Syria, now undergoing recovery after years of civil war, which saw the ousting of long-time dictator Bashar Al-Assad in late 2024. The new president, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, is working to consolidate control, while the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have secured parts of the northeast. Greater Manchester Police have yet to comment on the arrests or the incidents at the protest.
