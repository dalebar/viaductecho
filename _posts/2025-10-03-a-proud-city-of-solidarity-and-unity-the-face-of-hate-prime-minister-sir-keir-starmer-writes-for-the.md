As Manchester copes with the recent Crumpsall synagogue terror attack, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visited the site to thank emergency services and express condolences to the community. He emphasised that this attack isnâ€™t just against the Jewish community but against all decent Mancunians who value tolerance and compassion. Starmer highlighted the long-standing coexistence of diverse faiths in Manchester and condemned the rising antisemitism. With the anniversary of the October 7 attacks approaching, he noted the increased fear among Jewish communities at home and abroad. Starmer assured that security will be boosted at synagogues and urged respecting the grief of the Jewish community during upcoming protests. He called for unity and solidarity in the face of hate, reaffirming that Jews should feel safe to live and worship without fear in Manchester and the UK. The message is clear: we need to stand together and look out for one another in tough times.
