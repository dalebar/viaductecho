Four victims from a tragic head-on crash in Bolton have been identified. The accident occurred on Wigan Road around 12.45am on January 12, involving a red Seat Leon and a Citroen C4 Picasso taxi. The deceased are Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar (18), Farhan Patel (18), Mohammed Danyaal (19), and Masrob Ali (54), the taxi driver. Families are receiving support from specially-trained officers. Five others from both vehicles remain in hospital, with a 29-year-old woman suffering potentially life-threatening injuries. Investigators are early in their work, including looking into a clip showing a driver speeding over 120mph shortly before the crash. Detective Inspector Andrew Page urged the public to think before sharing video footage on social media, highlighting its potential impact on the families. The police are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.
