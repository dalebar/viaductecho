This Saturday in Stockport, expect a cool and rainy day with temperatures between 3°C and 7°C. It'll kick off with overcast skies turning partly cloudy, but rain is definitely on the cards—100% chance of it, in fact! 

Be prepared for a persistent drizzle; it might be light or heavier at times. The humidity's quite high at 91%, so it’ll feel chillier than it is. Gentle winds from the west at about 7 mph won't really help with the dampness.

If you're heading out, make sure you've got your waterproof gear ready—umbrellas and raincoats are a must! The roads could be slippery, so take extra care when driving.

With all that rain, it might be a good time to stay indoors and enjoy a cosy day with hobbies or a book. If you need to venture out, layering up is the way to go! Stay warm and safe!
