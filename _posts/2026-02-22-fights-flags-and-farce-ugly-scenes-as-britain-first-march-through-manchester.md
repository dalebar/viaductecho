Today, Manchester witnessed some tense moments as Britain First held a controversial march through the city centre, facing off against anti-racism protesters. Skirmishes broke out at various locations, including Bloom Street and Piccadilly Gardens, leading to six arrests. The situation began with supporters of Britain First gathering, but tensions escalated when anti-racism campaigners tried to block their route. Despite the unrest, daily life in the city carried on as normal, with many locals going about their Saturday routines. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke at a nearby counter-demonstration. As the rally wrapped up at Castlefield Bowl, poor weather led to a dwindling crowd, and a lacklustre conclusion saw party leaders struggle to keep the remaining attendees engaged. Overall, it ended as both a chaotic and farcical day for Britain First in the heart of Manchester.
