Two blokes have been nicked after police raided cannabis farms in Rochdale. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and Rochdale Council teamed up on October 23 to carry out multiple warrants. One raid at a house on Essex Street found 100 cannabis plants, leading to the arrest of the two men for cannabis production and stealing electricity. Theyâ€™re currently in custody. Another raid on Kings Road uncovered a massive farm with over 200 plants, but no one was found inside, and the power supply had been tampered with. Sgt Walsh from the North Neighbourhood Team highlighted the importance of these operations in tackling organised crime, pointing out that the seized cannabis was nearly ready for sale, potentially targeting vulnerable residents. Police encourage locals to report any suspicious activities, either by calling 101 or using the GMP Live chat, or hitting up Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111.
