There was a crash on the M60 in Manchester early this morning, leading to traffic build-up. The motorway was closed clockwise between junctions 13 and 15 after a car hit the central reservation. Emergency services were dispatched, but the road has since reopened. 

Traffic should be easing up now, but if you were diverted, the National Highways recommend following the solid diamond diversion symbol: exit at J13, take the second exit onto A575 Walkden Road, turn right onto A580 eastbound, and rejoin the M60 at J15.
