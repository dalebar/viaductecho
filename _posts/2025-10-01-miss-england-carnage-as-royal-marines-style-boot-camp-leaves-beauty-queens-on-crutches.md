Two beauty queens were injured during a tough Royal Marines-style boot camp as part of the Miss England pageant. Twenty contestants traded in their heels for trainers, facing a challenging fitness test that involved shuttle-runs, press-ups, and squats. The session, led by personal trainer Andy Osborne at Leicester City FC's training ground, was aimed at securing a spot in the top 12 for the grand final. Unfortunately, Grace Richardson, 20, and Harriet Jeffrey, 21, both ended up on crutches due to injuries, with Harriet suffering a torn ligament and tissue damage in her knee. Despite their setbacks, both are determined to recover in time for the semi-finals and support their fellow contestants. Miss Manchester, Victoria Quinlan, won the Miss England Sports Award. The semi-final is set for October 3 at Wolverhamptonâ€™s Grand Station.
