Police in Greater Manchester are worried about two missing teenage girls, Caitlyn, 15, and Olivia, 14, who haven't been seen for a few days. Caitlyn was last spotted in Burnley on Saturday evening, while Olivia was last seen in Altrincham on Monday night. The police believe they are together and are appealing for public help to find them. 

Caitlyn is described as 5ft 10in, with long black hair, wearing a white top, black flare trousers, a black puffer jacket, and white New Balance trainers. Olivia has shoulder-length red/purple hair and was last seen in a black coat and dark joggers. 

Authorities want to ensure the girls are safe and are urging anyone with information to contact them via 101, quoting the relevant reference numbers.
