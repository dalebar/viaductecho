Plans to develop 200 homes on Mirrlees Fields in Hazel Grove, Stockport, have been approved after years of protests from residents. The site will include a sizeable public open space and is near Woodsmoor train station and Stepping Hill Hospital. Despite the council's initial refusal due to concerns about losing valuable green space, a planning appeal overturned this decision. The development has sparked frustration among locals, with over 5,000 signing a petition against it, citing congestion and the need for natural refuges. The new homes will consist of one-bedroom apartments and various family houses, aimed at affordable living through shared ownership or social rent. Developers Kellen Homes and Great Places Housing Group emphasised their commitment to enhancing the local environment alongside housing needs. While some see this as a necessary step in providing affordable homes, former councillor Tom Morrison expressed disappointment, highlighting the community's strong attachment to the land.
