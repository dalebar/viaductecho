The family of Paul Anderson, a 55-year-old man who died in an alleged murder in Oldham, have paid heartfelt tribute to him, describing him as a "gentleman with a big heart" and a "loveable rogue." He passed away following an altercation at a home on Plumpton Close in Royton. The police were called at 7:50pm on December 6, and sadly, he was pronounced dead at the scene. His family expressed their devastation, stating their hearts will be "forever broken." A 59-year-old man, David Warren Jack, has been charged with his murder and is due to appear at Tameside Magistrates' Court. Greater Manchester Police are urging anyone with information related to the case to come forward, either by calling 101 or contacting Crimestoppers anonymously.
