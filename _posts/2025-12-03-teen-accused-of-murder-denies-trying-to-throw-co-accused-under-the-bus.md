Three boys are on trial for the murder of 14-year-old Ibrahima Seck, who was fatally stabbed in New Moston last summer. Boy A, 14, admits to manslaughter but denies murder, while Boys B and C, aged 17 and 14 respectively, also deny both charges. The incident occurred as Ibrahima was heading to play football. It was revealed that Boy A recorded a rap bragging about the murder. Two women, Naomi Heavens and Keri Dobson, are accused of helping the boys evade capture and also deny the charges against them. During questioning, Boy B was accused of trying to blame Boy A. He admitted to giving Boy A a knife, stating it was Boy A's, but thought he was just punching Ibrahima. The jury has been presented with conflicting accounts, as both Boy B and C maintain their innocence. The case is still ongoing.
