Early on Tuesday, December 30, a crash on the M6 blocked access to Knutsford services, specifically between junctions 18 and 19. Cheshire police were on the scene, and while the severity of the incident remains unclear, they've now reopened the slip road. Thankfully, the M6 has been fully cleared and is back to normal. National Highways expressed gratitude to drivers for their patience during the disruption.
