Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust (GMMH) has been ranked as one of the worst mental health trusts in the UK, sitting at 58 out of 61 non-acute trusts in a new league table. The ranking examines factors like financial performance, patient treatment access, and ambulance response times. In contrast, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust scored impressively, ranking third for acute trusts, and the North West Ambulance Service was the top-rated in England. GMMH's low ranking comes on the heels of serious controversies, including allegations of patient abuse highlighted in a 2022 BBC Panorama documentary and criticisms from the Care Quality Commission regarding service inadequacies. CEO Karen Howell acknowledged the trustâ€™s position within the Recovery Support Programme but expressed optimism about ongoing improvements. There's a commitment to enhance performance and create better conditions for both staff and service users.
