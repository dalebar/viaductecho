A new project is set to enhance Mariner's Canal in Salford Quays, between Anchorage tram stop and the Lowry Theatre. The first phase, costing £200,000, aims to add greenery and community spaces, with work kicking off in February and lasting about 12 weeks. The focus will be on the south-western paddle near the Water Sports Centre, featuring larger planting beds aimed at boosting biodiversity, developed with local groups. While 17 struggling trees will be removed, an equal number of more suitable species will be replanted to improve visibility and the area's long-term health. The lower path alongside the canal will be temporarily closed, but a higher route will remain open with diversions. The council noted that existing trees have been underperforming, with some already removed for safety, and that addressing this now helps prevent future decline and enhances monitoring for anti-social behaviour.
