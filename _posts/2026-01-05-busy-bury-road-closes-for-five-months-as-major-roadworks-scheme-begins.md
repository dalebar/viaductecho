Market Street in Bury town centre is set to close for five months starting January 5, as part of a £6m travel upgrade. The closure aims to introduce new cycle lanes and crossing signals, affecting traffic until June 26. It’ll be done in phases, beginning at the Angouleme Way junction. Motorists should expect diversions and potential delays during busy times, but access to Bury College and a nearby car park will remain. This work is part of phase two of the Fishpool and Pimhole Bee Active Travel Scheme and, while it may take up to 18 months to complete fully, the council promises it will wrap up in 24 weeks. Funded by a government transport fund, the scheme focuses on making local walking and cycling safer and more accessible alongside traffic calming measures. There's also other work happening at the Rochdale Road junction, with footpath widening expected soon. Bury Council reminds road users to plan for extra travel time during this period.
