Elderly residents in Horwich are facing two-week delays in receiving crucial NHS letters due to issues with second-class post. This has resulted in at least one man missing a vital hospital appointment. Bolton West MP Phil Brickell has raised concerns about Royal Mail allegedly prioritising parcels over letters during the busy festive season. However, Royal Mail claims there's no evidence of such prioritisation outside of known contingency plans and acknowledges the importance of NHS letters. Reports from residents indicate significant delays, with one woman receiving 13 pieces of post, mostly overdue, after complaints were made. Brickell emphasised the need for better service for residents relying on timely communication regarding appointments. Royal Mail responded, stating they’re working hard to maintain service levels and have implemented measures to optimise hospital letter delivery. They noted that busy periods, like Christmas, create challenges due to increased parcel volumes, which can impede letter delivery.
