A mosque in Stockport has shared a message of unity after St George's Cross flags were seen on lampposts in the local area. This is part of a nationwide initiative called 'operation raise the colours'. The Stockport Islamic Centre, located nearby, expressed pride in displaying the flag as a symbol of togetherness. Ghulam Abbas, the caretaker, who moved from Pakistan over 50 years ago, believes the flag can bridge community divides. Others in the area, like Ejiro Chukwadi from Nigeria, also view the flags positively, seeing them as a beautiful representation of national pride. Although some flags have been put up on high places and roundabouts, most have been allowed to stay unless posing a safety risk. The movement reflects a wave of patriotism sweeping through Greater Manchester.
