A man in his 50s has been bailed after being arrested on suspicion of rape near a community centre in Bolton. The arrest followed a report from a woman in her 30s who claimed she was attacked in Breightmet. Police responded quickly, arriving within 10 minutes and cordoning off the area around Deepdale Community Centre. Specialist officers are supporting the victim, while the investigation is ongoing. Detective Sergeant Liam Carolan reassured the public that this is treated as an isolated incident and emphasised the seriousness of such reports. The police are asking anyone with information to reach out via 101 or the GMP website, or anonymously through Crimestoppers.
