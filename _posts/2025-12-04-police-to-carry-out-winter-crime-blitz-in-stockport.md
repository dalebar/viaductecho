Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are launching 'Operation North Star' this December and January, aiming to crack down on crime in Stockport and the wider area. With increased patrols during the festive season, GMP will focus on hotspots identified by community input, tackling issues like retail crime, anti-social behaviour, and violence against women and girls. This initiative follows the success of 'Safe4Summer', which saw significant reductions in crime rates. Assistant Chief Constable Matt Boyle emphasised the goal of keeping Greater Manchester safe during the winter festivities, promising a tough stance on any criminal activity. Deputy Mayor Kate Green highlighted the importance of community safety, especially during the holidays, stating that both GMP and their partners are dedicated to ensuring a secure environment for everyone.
