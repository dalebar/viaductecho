Two accidents happened within an hour on Queensway, Rochdale, on January 23. The first crash involved two vehicles around 6pm, with a child sustaining a back injury and taken to hospital. The second incident occurred at 7.05pm when a man got hit by a car; thankfully, his injuries aren't believed to be life-threatening. Police shut down the road near Oldham Road, and a Vauxhall Corsa with a smashed windscreen was seen at the scene.
