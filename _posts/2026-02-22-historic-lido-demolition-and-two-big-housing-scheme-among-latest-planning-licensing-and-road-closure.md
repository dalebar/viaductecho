Several significant development plans are underway across Greater Manchester. A historic lido in Sale, opened in the 1930s, is set to be demolished for housing, following its closure last year. In Stockport, proposals could see up to 175 homes built on greenspace behind Sainsbury’s in Hazel Grove, with 87 classified as affordable. Another plan includes 106 homes at a ‘green gateway’ estate aimed at addressing local housing needs. 

In Bury, traffic delays are expected due to roadworks along the A56, which will last until late February. Meanwhile, a former Barclays bank in Oldham might become a casino, and a new retirement village is planned in Rochdale offering 49 apartments and 18 bungalows. Developers are also eyeing a site in Worsley for 155 homes, while Ashton Town Hall is set for a £25 million revamp, including community spaces and a possible extension. Lastly, the Hesketh Arms pub in Shevington Moor may transform into a nursery for 52 children.
