MEPC, the developer behind Manchester's NOMA district, has been selected to spearhead the £200M redevelopment of the former Crompton Place shopping centre in Bolton. This ambitious project aims to transform the once-bustling retail hub, now mostly vacant, into one of the largest inner-town development spaces in the UK. 

Bolton council purchased the site in 2018 for around £15m and plans to demolish it this year, paving the way for a mixed-use development that could include 340 homes, a hotel, 80,000 sq ft of office space, and leisure facilities. There's even talk of a 'meanwhile use' for part of the site while redevelopment is underway, with a footpath to reconnect Victoria Square and Bradshawgate. 

Council leader Nick Peel highlighted the significance of this project for Bolton and praised MEPC’s solid track record in major developments across the UK, including projects in Leeds, Oxford, and Birmingham. Following a competitive selection process, the council is optimistic about sharing more exciting details soon.
