In late December 2003, the remains of Philip Noakes were found in Worsley Woods, sparking a murder investigation. Noakes was a devoted father whose disappearance worried his mother. Suspicions soon targeted Stephen McColl, a violent criminal with the nickname 'Boom Boom Magoo'. McColl, originally from Glasgow, was known for armed robbery and had even worked as a police informant. After a past relationship soured, McColl murdered Michael Doran, a fellow informant. Doran’s body was never discovered. McColl went on to kill Noakes, torturing him before dumping his body. Years later, after extensive investigations, forensic evidence linked McColl to both murders. In 2006, he was found guilty and sentenced to a rare whole life term. The case raised serious questions about the police's use of informants, particularly as Scotland warned GMP about McColl’s dangerousness. Noakes’ mother remembered him fondly, while Doran’s family still mourns his unsolved disappearance. The whole affair serves as a stark reminder of the complexities in policing and criminal informants.
