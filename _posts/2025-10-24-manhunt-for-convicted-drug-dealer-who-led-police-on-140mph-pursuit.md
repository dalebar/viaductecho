Ateeq Rehman, a 25-year-old convicted drug dealer from Rochdale, is currently the subject of a manhunt after he led police on a high-speed chase, reaching 140mph. He was sentenced to over six years in prison in his absence for drug-related charges, including supplying cocaine and heroin. Rehman already accepted a dangerous driving charge linked to his arrest in July 2023. He failed to attend his sentencing hearing on October 17, prompting police to issue a warrant for his arrest. His mobile phone connections tied him to the 'Adam' drug line, which transported Class A drugs from Rochdale to Peterborough over several months. The chase began when police spotted him driving recklessly, nearly hitting a pedestrian. When apprehended, officers found a Gucci bag with drugs and cash, and Rehman was banned from driving for over five years. Detectives urge anyone with information on his whereabouts to reach out to the police, emphasising the importance of bringing him to justice.
