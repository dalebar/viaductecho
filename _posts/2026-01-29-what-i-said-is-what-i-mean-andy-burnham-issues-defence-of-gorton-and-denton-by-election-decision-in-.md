Andy Burnham has made a strong 11-minute case for his bid to become the Gorton and Denton MP, even though Labour’s ruling body blocked it shortly after. In his first major interview post-announcement, he stated he's back to focusing on his role as mayor and has been reflecting on the impact this situation has had on his family. Burnham emphasised he can't control what happens and defended his motives, arguing that he sought to protect the partnerships he's built in Greater Manchester and push back against Reform politics. He clarified that he consulted senior Labour figures before entering the race and assured the Prime Minister he wasn’t aiming to undermine him. Furthermore, Burnham pushed back against claims he was naive in expecting approval from the NEC and labelled the briefings against him as untrue. He acknowledged the emotional toll on his family during this process and concluded that he’s now fully committed to his mayoral duties and reflects on the challenges faced.
