Residents of Warren Street in Salford are really fed up with the ongoing fly-tipping problem, which includes mattresses and loads of rubbish left scattered about. They’re calling for cameras to be installed to catch the culprits. Concerns about health risks from the rubbish pile have sparked frustration, with some saying it’s been there for over a year. Salix Homes, who manage the land, acknowledged the area is a hotspot and have been removing waste regularly, but it’s clearly not enough. There’s a sense of urgency among locals for more action, like better signage and surveillance, to deter offenders. Salford Council mentioned they've been tackling fly-tipping and incurred quite a cost dealing with the issue, emphasizing that it's the community suffering the most. A clean-up was scheduled soon, but residents want lasting solutions to prevent this mess from happening again.
