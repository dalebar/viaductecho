Stockport Masonic Guildhall has been beautifully refurbished, restoring its Victorian charm from 1868. After years of falling into disrepair, the Freemasons initiated a significant renovation project about seven years ago, which is still ongoing, with some upper floor rooms yet to be completed. The upgrades have made the Guildhall more accessible and visually stunning, setting the stage for various events, from weddings to festivalsâ€”like the upcoming Mind Body Spirit event with workshops and activities.

Originally serving as a Sunday School, the building became home to the Freemasons in 1932 and has witnessed many historic events, including hosting evacuee children during WWII. Recently, locals got a sneak peek during an open day, where Freemason Andy Ferri highlighted the venue's potential for hospitality and events. The renovation adds a fresh chapter to the Guildhall's impressive history, enhancing its role within the community.
