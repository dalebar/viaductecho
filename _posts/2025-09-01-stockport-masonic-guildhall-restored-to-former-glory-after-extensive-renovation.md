Stockport Masonic Guildhall has had a stunning makeover, restoring its Victorian charm from 1868. Located on Wellington Road South, the building had fallen into disrepair, but the Freemasons kicked off an extensive refurbishment project about seven years ago. While some interior works are still ongoing, the improvements so far have breathed new life into the Guildhall, making it more accessible and visually appealing for various events. It's already a popular spot for weddings, festivals, and community happenings, with the upcoming Mind Body Spirit event showcasing lots of workshops and activities. The Guildhall has a rich history, having functioned as a Sunday School before the Freemasons took over in 1932, and it even housed evacuee children during WWII. Members of the public recently had a chance to explore the renovations, and the Freemasons are excited to welcome many more events in the future. The refurb was handled by Stone Central and Touchstone Glazing.
