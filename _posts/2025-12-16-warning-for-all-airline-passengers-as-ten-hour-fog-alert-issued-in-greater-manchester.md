A ten-hour fog alert has been issued for Greater Manchester, including Manchester Airport, starting from midnight until 10am on Wednesday, December 17. The Met Office is warning of 'dense fog' that could disrupt travel, affecting buses, trains, and flights. This comes after a day of significant disruption at the airport, when over 200 flights were delayed due to heavy rain and one runway being out of action. Fog can slow down planes' movements and necessitate larger gaps between landings, which complicates airport operations. The fog is expected to develop on Tuesday night, with challenging travel conditions anticipated, particularly in the East Midlands and Cambridgeshire. Other regions, including parts of Wales and the South of England, are also facing rain warnings. The Met Office advises passengers to check the weather forecast and communicate with airlines to minimise delays.
