On a sunny May evening in 2038, you’re in MediaCity, needing to get to town by 6pm while facing heavy tram traffic due to a Manchester United match. Luckily, a yellow Bee Network Boat is on its way, offering a speedy alternative route via the Ship Canal. Architecture firm WW+P envisions this waterway transport system, claiming it fits the 21st century and could revamp Manchester's transport scene, much like other UK cities already benefiting from aquatic travel. With record tram demand and significant new housing planned around the Ship Canal, the firm argues this low-cost transport could relieve packed trams. TfGM is open to the idea of passenger ferries and other innovative transport solutions, hoping to enhance city livability by reconnecting with its waterways. Overall, the vision aims to make traveling around Manchester not just easier but more enjoyable, celebrating the city’s rich canal heritage.
