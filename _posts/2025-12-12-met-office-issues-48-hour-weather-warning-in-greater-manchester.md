A 48-hour yellow weather warning for rain has been issued in Greater Manchester, starting from 6pm on Saturday until 6pm on Monday. This affects various areas, including Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, and Tameside, along with parts of Manchester, Salford, and Wigan. Although some areas may see heavy rainfall, it's unlikely to hit Greater Manchester as severely, with forecasts suggesting light rain instead. Saturday night is expected to be mostly dry and cloudy, with only a 20% chance of rain. On Sunday, light rain is anticipated, particularly in Bolton, Bury, and Rochdale, while Oldham and Tameside might experience showers. Monday's forecast includes overcast skies and a 50% chance of rain, with the heaviest rainfall expected in the afternoon. The Met Office has warned of total accumulations ranging from 50-70mm across the warning area, with possibly over 200mm in higher ground areas like Cumbria. Strong winds could also occur. Similar rain warnings are in effect for parts of Scotland.
