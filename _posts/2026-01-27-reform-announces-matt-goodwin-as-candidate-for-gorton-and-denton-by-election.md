Reform UK has chosen Matt Goodwin as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election. At a press conference, Goodwin labelled the election a 'referendum on Keir Starmer' and highlighted his deep roots in Greater Manchester, including a history of delivering pizzas there while studying at the University of Salford. Goodwin, a commentator and former academic, emphasised his non-career politician status and expressed concern that the constituency has been overlooked. He plans to focus on issues like tackling anti-social behaviour and helping the local economy. Reform leader Nigel Farage echoed this sentiment, framing the election as a chance to oust Starmer and address pressing national concerns. Goodwin, who values inclusivity across the political spectrum, aims to represent the people of Gorton and Denton and insists Reform is the answer to the challenges facing the community.
