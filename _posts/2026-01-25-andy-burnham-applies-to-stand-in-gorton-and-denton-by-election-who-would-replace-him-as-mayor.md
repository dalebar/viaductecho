Andy Burnham's decision to resign as Greater Manchester mayor to run for the Gorton and Denton parliamentary seat is set to spark a significant political shuffle. He’s looking to gain approval from Labour’s National Executive Committee for his candidacy. If he succeeds, Manchester will need a new mayor, with a by-election scheduled soon. According to the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016, there can't be a vacancy for long, so his deputy must step in. 

Burnham has two deputies: Kate Green, appointed to oversee emergency services, and Paul Dennett, elected as Salford's City Mayor. Dennett would likely take on the interim mayor role because he was elected, while Green was appointed. If Dennett can't serve, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority would make decisions collectively. With most authority members being Labour, policies aligned with Burnham are expected to continue. If Dennett steps up, it would be a notable highlight in his political journey over the past 14 years, having served both Salford and the wider authority.
