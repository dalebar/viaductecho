Christopher Ridgway from Stockport has been fined over £1,500 for illegally dumping waste he charged residents to remove. Operating as "Stockport Waste Removal," he lacked the necessary licence and instead disposed of rubbish for free at local tips, even fly-tipping in one case. Investigators linked him to the crimes through a branded t-shirt found at the scene. Ridgway pleaded guilty at Tameside Magistrates' Court, resulting in a £480 fine, a £192 victim surcharge, and £832.70 in clean-up costs. Councillor Dan Oliver stressed that illegal waste disposal won’t be tolerated and urged residents to check for valid waste carrier licences before hiring anyone to avoid waste crime in Stockport.
