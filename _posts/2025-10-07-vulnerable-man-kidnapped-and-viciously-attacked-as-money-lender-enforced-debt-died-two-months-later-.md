A man named Martin Shaw was attacked and kidnapped by Jason Wadsworth and Jemma Marshall, both 37, after Shaw failed to repay debts he owed to Marshall, who was identified as a money lender. The incident occurred on September 10, 2023, when Marshall allegedly forced Shaw into her Audi A3, leading to a 15-minute assault while driving around Oldham. If not for a friend's timely call for an ambulance, Shaw might have died on the spot. He was hospitalised and remained in critical care for nearly two months before dying on November 4, 2023, from liver failure. Prosecutors claim both defendants played a role in the brutal assault driven by the pursuit of money. While Marshall maintained she was merely giving Shaw a lift home, Wadsworthâ€™s account pointed to the debt as the motive. Both have pleaded not guilty to murder and an alternative manslaughter charge. The trial is ongoing at Manchester Crown Court.
