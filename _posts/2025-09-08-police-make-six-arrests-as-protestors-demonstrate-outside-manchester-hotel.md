Police arrested six people during a protest outside the Best Western Hotel on Wilmslow Road, Fallowfield, which is housing asylum seekers. This demonstration is part of ongoing nationwide protests against hotels accommodating asylum seekers. The Greater Manchester Police revealed that two individuals were arrested for racially aggravated public order offences, while others faced charges related to theft, assault, indecent exposure, and outraging public decency. A dispersal order was put in place to manage the situation and ensure safety, allowing officers to move on anyone causing distress. Chief Inspector Trevor Eaton highlighted the balance between respecting the right to protest and maintaining public safety. Residents can expect a heightened police presence in the area. If anyone has information, they can contact GMP or anonymously reach out to Crimestoppers.
