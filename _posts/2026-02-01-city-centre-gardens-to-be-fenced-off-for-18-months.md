Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester is set for an 18-month upgrade to transform it into a more attractive space. The area has gained a negative reputation due to anti-social behaviour, prompting council officials to enhance safety, add greenery, and host public events. Residents have expressed concern about the gardens losing their charm, with some feeling unsafe visiting at night. There are plans to remove old walls and introduce more seating, play equipment, and landscaping, aiming to make it a welcoming spot for both locals and visitors. Feedback has shown a desire for a prettier, more natural environment, with the council inviting locals to vote on floral displays for the gardens. Overall, the project seeks to elevate Piccadilly Gardens to match the charm of other major European cities.
