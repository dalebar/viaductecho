An Oldham mum known as Leyla faced immense challenges after being relocated to Harpurhey with her son due to a rent hike that pushed her into temporary accommodation. With her son's school now two hours away by foot or a complicated public transport journey, she ended up spending £40 a day on Ubers just to get him there on time. Leyla described struggling with basics like cooking facilities and shared resources, ultimately leading her to rely on takeaways and microwave meals. The situation forced her to make the tough decision to send her son to live with family in Oldham, where he could stay closer to school. This separation deeply affected both of them, with her son showing signs of emotional distress. Despite Leyla's efforts and the frequent moves between different temporary accommodations, she feels unsupported and stresses the need for better local authority assistance for families like hers. Councillor Elaine Taylor acknowledged the difficulties faced by families in temporary housing and suggested that while support is available, the demand often exceeds supply. The Manchester Evening News is advocating for a new bus pass to help children in such situations, aiming to ease the burden on families in temporary accommodation.
