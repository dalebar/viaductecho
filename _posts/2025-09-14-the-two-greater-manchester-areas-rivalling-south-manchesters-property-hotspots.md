Didsbury and Chorlton are prime spots in Manchester, loved for their vibrant communities and proximity to the city centre. Didsbury boasts lush streets and top schools, with property prices averaging £436,206—up 10% from last year. Chorlton’s appeal lies in its cultural vibe and lively high streets, with average prices around £545,417. For those feeling priced out, Prestwich and Whitefield offer more affordable alternatives. Prestwich, often dubbed the "Didsbury of the north," has a community spirit and a booming food scene, with average property prices around £318,000. Whitefield is quieter, ideal for commuters, with similar pricing—averaging between £318,000 and £328,000.
