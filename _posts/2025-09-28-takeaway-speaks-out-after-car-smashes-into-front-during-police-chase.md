The owners of the Heywood Star takeaway have expressed their regret after a car crashed into their building during a police chase early Sunday morning, causing significant damage. The incident occurred on Bridge Street around 4am, resulting in the front wall collapsing and leaving the first floor exposed. Thankfully, no one was seriously harmed. The takeaway has closed indefinitely and is apologising to customers for the inconvenience.

The police were initially called to a disturbance in Bury when a vehicle sped off, leading to the pursuit. The car, driven by a man in his 30s, crashed into the takeaway and was pinned under debris. He was taken to hospital with an arm injury and subsequently arrested on various charges. Investigations are ongoing, and local authorities are assessing the building's safety. Greater Manchester Police have appealed for witnesses to inform them about what they saw.
