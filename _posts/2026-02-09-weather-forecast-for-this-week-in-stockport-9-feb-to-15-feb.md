This week's weather in Stockport is looking quite dreary, with plenty of clouds and a good chance of rain, especially early on. Expect single-digit temperatures, ranging from a high of 10°C on Monday to as low as 1°C by Friday, with a brief flirtation with snow. 

Monday kicks off with steady rain clearing later, while Tuesday and Wednesday keep the gloom with more rain and humidity peaking around 94%. Thursday stays cloudy, and Friday sees potential snow or rain, dropping to a chilly 5°C. Saturday starts off sunny but clouds up by the afternoon, and Sunday turns cold with a strong chance of rain or snow. 

Compared to last week, it’s definitely colder and a bit windier, so be prepared for possible commuting challenges. For weekend plans, keep it indoors on Sunday and dress warmly for Saturday if you fancy some outdoor time before it gets cloudy. Stay dry!
