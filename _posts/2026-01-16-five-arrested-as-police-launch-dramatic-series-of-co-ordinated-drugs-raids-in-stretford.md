Five individuals, including a 16-year-old lad, were nabbed in pre-dawn drug raids on Derbyshire Avenue in Stretford. Local police, aided by a dog unit and drones, hit four homes where they found cannabis and what’s thought to be cocaine. The operation was sparked by a public tip-off. The teenager faces charges related to Class B drugs and a separate robbery, while a 39-year-old man and two others (aged 28 and 61) were arrested for Class A and B drug offences. All five remain in custody. Insp Jamie Jeffries highlighted the operation's significance, pointing out that it reflects serious intelligence and a commitment to tackling drug networks in Trafford. He urged anyone with information to come forward, reinforcing that community intel fuels their operations.
