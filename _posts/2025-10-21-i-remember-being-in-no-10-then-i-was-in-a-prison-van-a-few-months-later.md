Mike Amesbury, a former Labour MP from Wythenshawe, is struggling to find work a year after resigning due to a conviction for assault. He spent a short time in prison after pleading guilty to punching Paul Fellows in a street dispute over a bridge closure in Frodsham. After his release, Amesbury's prison sentence was reduced to a suspended one, prompting his resignation from his parliamentary role which led to a by-election won by Reform. Despite applying for over 30 jobs, he hasn’t been successful and has sold his family home due to financial strains. Reflecting on his past, Amesbury expressed regret over the incident, attributing his actions to being under the influence of alcohol. He hopes to serve as an example of the consequences of poor choices, emphasizing the importance of considering how mistakes can impact one’s life.
