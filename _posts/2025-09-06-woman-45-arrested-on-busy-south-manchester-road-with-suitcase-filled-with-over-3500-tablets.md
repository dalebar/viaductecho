A 45-year-old woman was arrested in south Manchester for possessing over 3,500 Class B and C tablets with intent to supply. Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit stopped her vehicle on Princess Road early Friday morning, after it had come from London and was suspected of drug supply. A search revealed a suitcase packed with controlled tablets, including pregabalin and tramadol, along with cannabis products. The police believe these drugs were destined for illegal distribution across Greater Manchester.
