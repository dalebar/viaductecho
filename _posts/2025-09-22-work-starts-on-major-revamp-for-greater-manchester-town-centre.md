Exciting changes are on the way for Peine Square in Heywood! The plan includes new green spaces, seating, and informal play areas aimed at giving the square a fresh look. This redevelopment is part of a larger multi-million pound initiative to modernise the Heywood Civic Centre. The project, overseen by the Heywood Town Board, is funded by £20m from the government’s ‘Plan for Neighbourhoods’. 

Key features of the revamp include tiered seating, a mini stage for public events, and improved planting, paving, and lighting. Brian Davies from the Town Board expressed enthusiasm about the project, highlighting community support for the changes. Councillor Angela Brown also praised the scheme, noting its potential to transform the area into a vibrant destination. 

Over the next decade, the government funding will be rolled out in phases, with detailed plans for the remaining funds expected to be submitted by year’s end. This revitalisation is expected to create a welcoming gateway to the civic centre and enhance the overall charm of Heywood town centre.
