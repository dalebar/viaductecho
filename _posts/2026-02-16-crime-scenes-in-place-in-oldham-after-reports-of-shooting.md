In Oldham, crime scenes were set up following a shooting reported on Sunday (February 15) on School House Road. Police and forensic teams arrived, focusing on a targeted property, while a large area around Roundthorn Road was cordoned off. Local residents noticed CSI officers working at the scene for several hours. Social media showed police activity, including vans at the nearby junction with Aspull Street. This shooting comes shortly after a stabbing and other violent incidents in Chadderton and Coldhurst. Details about the Sunday incident are still pending, and Greater Manchester Police have been asked for a statement.
