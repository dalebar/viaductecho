In Salford's centenary year, Mayor Paul Dennett has highlighted the alarming situation where 'no babies are being born' due to the closure of the Ingleside Birth Centre since 2022, which remains inaccessible for birthing despite providing antenatal and postnatal care. Both the Mayor and MP Rebecca Long-Bailey have stressed the need for urgent action, as local women are forced to travel outside the city to give birth. Although the NHS Greater Manchester has cited midwifery staffing challenges as a reason for the closure, a maternity services review is planned for 2026/27 to address this issue. Salford Council aims to restore safe, high-quality birthing facilities, with Mayor Dennett expressing strong commitment to bringing services back to the city, ensuring families can once again welcome their children in Salford. The community's understanding and support have been appreciated as efforts continue to navigate this challenging situation.
