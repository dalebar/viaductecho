Richard Shaw, a 46-year-old council worker from Bolton, has been sentenced to four years and eight months for stealing nearly £900,000 from vulnerable benefit claimants, including 43 who had passed away. Between 2015 and 2023, he exploited his role in the financial protection team at Bolton Council, diverting funds into his accounts. Initially denying the charges, he later pleaded guilty at Bolton Crown Court in December 2025. Investigations revealed he made a series of bank transfers totalling £893,296 for personal use, purchasing luxury items and even a holiday lodge. Shaw was dismissed for gross misconduct in March 2023 after the council raised concerns with the police. The Crown Prosecution Service highlighted his blatant exploitation of vulnerable individuals, stating he used their accounts since they were unlikely to be monitored. Bolton Council reassured the public that such dishonest acts are rare and do not reflect the overall integrity of their workforce.
