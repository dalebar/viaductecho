A man has been arrested after his car crashed into a house in Wythenshawe on Friday night (September 5). Emergency services rushed to Altrincham Road where the car, following a collision with a lorry, flipped onto its roof and struck the property. Three people were taken to hospital, but thankfully none have serious injuries. The 25-year-old suspect was charged with dangerous driving, being under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and failing to stop, and he remains in custody for questioning. Firefighters from Wythenshawe and Ashton attended the scene to assist and ensure the building's safety in collaboration with a structural engineer from Manchester City Council. The area is currently being investigated, and the property has been boarded up as debris is cleared.
