Angry Ginge, a contestant on this year's *I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here*, is making waves and is a favourite to win the crown. He’s part of the Bov Boys, a content-creating collective that includes Ginge and his mates, who share their everyday lives online and garner huge views. His friend Jakey has shared some insights into Ginge's journey, noting how casual Ginge was when he announced he’d be on the show. Fans have seen a more emotional side of him, which Jakey feels is important for breaking down the stigma around men expressing emotions. Ginge’s mum, Michelle, is proud of his achievements and amused by the attention he’s getting from female fans. Despite the newfound fame, Jakey thinks Ginge is focused on his work and not looking for romance just yet. As the finale approaches, Jakey is confident that Ginge has what it takes to win, highlighting the strong bonds he’s formed with other contestants. The final airs on December 7, and fans are excited to see how it all plays out!
