Ryan Wrigley, a notorious shoplifter, has been banned from all shops in Wilmslow, Cheshire, after pleading guilty to theft. He received a six-week suspended prison sentence and a five-year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO). This order prohibits him from entering any commercial retailer in the town centre, with police on alert to monitor compliance. PC Madi Forrest expressed relief over the CBO, hoping it offers some peace of mind to local retailers. Wrigley faces significant penalties, including fines or jail time, if he breaches the order. Residents are encouraged to report any violations to Cheshire Police.
