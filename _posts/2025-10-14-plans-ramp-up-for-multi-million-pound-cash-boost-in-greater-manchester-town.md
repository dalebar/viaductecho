Rochdale's Smallbridge and Hurstead area is set to receive a Â£20m investment over the next decade as part of the government's Pride in Place programme. Led by a new Neighbourhood Board of local residents, community groups, and councillors, the funding aims to address various community needs. MP Paul Waugh has reached out to local households to encourage their input on spending priorities, with early ideas including tackling congestion, improving local facilities, and creating green spaces. 

Local skepticism remains about the investment, with long-term residents like 90-year-old Ken Whittle expressing doubts due to years of neglect and underinvestment. Another resident, Dinah Banks, echoed similar concerns, highlighting the need for better healthcare services. A community meeting is scheduled for early December, inviting residents to voice their thoughts and contribute to shaping their area's future. For more details or to share ideas, locals can reach out via email or phone.
