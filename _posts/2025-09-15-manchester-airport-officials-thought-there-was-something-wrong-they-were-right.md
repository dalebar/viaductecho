Oliver Chiverton, a 32-year-old man, was caught with 26 kilos of cannabis worth over Â£60,000 at Manchester Airport after moving to Thailand to restart his life. Stopped by Border Force, he initially denied ownership of two suitcases, claiming they might contain cigarettes. However, the suitcases were found to contain multiple packages of cannabis. Chiverton pleaded guilty, stating he had a drug debt from his time in Thailand and was coerced into smuggling the drugs to clear it. The court learned he had previous convictions for violence and drug possession. His defence argued he was trying to rebuild his life and was desperate after being cut off from work. Ultimately, he received a 14-month suspended sentence, along with rehabilitation orders and community service.
