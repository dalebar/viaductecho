The MD of Manchester Airport, Chris Woodroofe, has shared plans for the airport’s future, aiming for 40 million passengers a year by 2026. Significant celebrations are on the horizon, including the 25th anniversary of the second runway. Following a £1.3 billion revamp, changes to Terminal 2 and plans for enhancing Terminal 3, including more shops and dining options, are set to elevate the airport experience. The iconic chandelier from Terminal 1 will be reimagined in Terminal 2's security hall. Woodroofe highlighted the importance of improved rail links to expand their catchment area and attract more airlines. The airport has added routes like Mumbai and Delhi this year, with ambitions for more in 2026, including insights into US travel, which still shows demand. Woodroofe expressed pride in connecting the North to the world, bringing greater opportunity to the region while celebrating the airport's continued growth and the community’s passion for international travel. Passengers can expect a vibrant airport environment with extensive new routes and enhanced facilities in the coming year.
