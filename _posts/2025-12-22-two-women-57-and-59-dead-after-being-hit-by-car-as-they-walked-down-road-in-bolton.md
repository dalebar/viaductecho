Two women, aged 57 and 59, tragically lost their lives in a collision in Bolton on December 22. The incident occurred around 7:40 am at the junction of Scout Road and Smithills Dean Road when a VW Polo struck both pedestrians. Emergency services quickly responded, but unfortunately, the women were pronounced dead at the scene. A 19-year-old man driving the car has been arrested on suspicion of causing their deaths by dangerous driving and is currently in custody for questioning. Greater Manchester Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit is looking for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage from the area to come forward. The roads around the crash site remain closed as investigations continue. If you have any information, you can reach out to the SCIU directly or contact Crimestoppers anonymously.
