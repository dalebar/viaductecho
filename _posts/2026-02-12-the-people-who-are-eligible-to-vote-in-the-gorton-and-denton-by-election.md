Polling day for the Gorton and Denton by-election is just two weeks away, set for February 26. This new constituency covers parts of Manchester and Tameside, with eight council wards involved. Only British, Irish, or qualifying Commonwealth citizens aged 18+ from these wards can vote, provided they registered by February 10. The wards include Burnage, Levenshulme, Longsight, Gorton & Abbey Hey, along with specific sections of Audenshaw and Denton areas. 

While registration deadlines have passed, voters can still appoint a proxy to vote up until 5pm on February 18. Remember, valid photo ID is required at polling stations, or you can apply for a Voter Authority Certificate online by the same deadline. 

There are 11 candidates from various parties contesting, including Sir Oink A-Lot from the Monster Raving Loony Party and Angeliki Stogia from Labour, among others. It's shaping up to be quite the race!
