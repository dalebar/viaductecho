A special bus named after Olivia Campbell-Hardy, a victim of the Manchester Arena bombing, was unveiled at Tottington High School. The TfGM bus will run the 469 route, which Olivia used to take, keeping her memory alive. Attended by her family, former teachers, current students, and Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, the event was a mix of emotions, with Olivia’s grandmother, Sharon Goodman, expressing pride and joy at seeing Olivia’s name on the bus. Olivia, who tragically lost her life at just 15 during the 2017 attack, was known for her love of dance and music, and had even auditioned for Britain’s Got Talent. Her family has established ‘Liv’s Trust’ to support young people in the arts. The bus, adorned with Greater Manchester bees in memory of the other victims, symbolises community strength. Mayor Burnham emphasised the lasting impression Olivia will make as the bus travels through her community. Olivia’s former teacher remembered her as an engaging student who brought joy to her classmates.
