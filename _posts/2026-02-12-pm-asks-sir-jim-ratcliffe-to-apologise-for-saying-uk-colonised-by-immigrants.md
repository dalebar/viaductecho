Sir Keir Starmer has slammed comments from billionaire Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about immigration, labelling them "offensive and wrong." In an interview, Sir Jim claimed that the UK had been "colonised by immigrants" and suggested that the Prime Minister wasn't tough enough to manage the economy. Starmer asserted that Britain is a "proud, tolerant and diverse country" and urged Sir Jim to apologise, a call echoed by No 10.

Various fans' groups, including the Manchester United Supporters Trust, also condemned the remarks, emphasising that no fan should feel excluded based on race or nationality. The Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club voiced concerns about the language used, associating it with far-right narratives.

Sir Jim, who has made significant changes at Manchester United, defended his comments, arguing that difficult decisions are needed for both the club and the country. He suggested politicians must be prepared to be unpopular to tackle major issues, including immigration. These comments faced backlash from multiple political leaders, asserting they were out of touch with British values.
