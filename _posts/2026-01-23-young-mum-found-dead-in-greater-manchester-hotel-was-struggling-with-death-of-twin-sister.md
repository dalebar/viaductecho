Courtney Reece Hallworth Pearson, a 31-year-old mother, was found dead at Boltholt Country Park Hotel in Bury on August 14, 2025. An inquest revealed she was struggling with her twin sister's death a year earlier, which exacerbated her existing issues with substance misuse and mental health. Homeless at her time of death, Courtney had sought refuge at the hotel, drawn to the staff and swimming facilities. Despite having a “competitive” spirit and moments of sobriety, she battled alcohol dependency and often avoided mental health support, frustrating herself and her loved ones. Although she demonstrated strong willpower, her struggles with past traumas and the recent loss of her sister took a toll. When police accessed her room after worried loved ones raised alarms, she was pronounced dead at the scene, with her death ruled a suicide. The coroner, Catherine McKenna, highlighted Courtney as a remarkable woman surrounded by devoted friends.
