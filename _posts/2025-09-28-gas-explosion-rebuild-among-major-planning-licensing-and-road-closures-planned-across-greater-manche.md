This week in Greater Manchester, big development plans are underway. Bury is looking to rebuild three homes destroyed by a gas explosion in February, with developers submitting like-for-like plans. Meanwhile, excitement grows in Manchester city centre where new padel courts could sprout atop the AO Arena, complete with a bar and seating, as part of a growing trend in the sport. In Farnworth, plans are in motion to convert a former church building into a 24-bedroom shared house. 

Key road closures will impact Prestwich for nine months due to a transport hub being built, and a Â£50m project is set to enhance Wigan's sewer system. Also, discussions continue about over 1,000 new homes at Woodford and a massive scheme for 2,150 homes on Tameside's green belt is advancing. Lastly, plans for demolishing a vandalised pub in Davyhulme aim to replace it with a convenience store and a drive-thru coffee shop. Busy times ahead for the region!
