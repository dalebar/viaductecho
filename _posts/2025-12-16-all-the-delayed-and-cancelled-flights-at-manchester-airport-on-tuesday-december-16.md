Manchester Airport faced numerous flight delays on December 15 due to heavy rain and poor visibility, which also led to a runway closure for repairs. While many delays were minor, some passengers experienced waits of several hours—like one couple who arrived at 7am but were still waiting at 2.30pm for their flight to Copenhagen. With the holiday season approaching, the airport anticipates its busiest Christmas ever, expecting 1.5 million passengers from December 19 to January 4. This Friday and December 28 are expected to be particularly busy, with around 100,000 travellers flying. If you're flying over the festive period, it's wise to keep an eye on your flight status, as weather can cause disruptions.
