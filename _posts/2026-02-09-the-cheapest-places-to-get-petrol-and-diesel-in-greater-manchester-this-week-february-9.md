This week, the cheapest petrol in Greater Manchester can be found at an ASDA garage in Bolton, costing 124.7p per litre. Filling up an average family car here would save you up to £6 compared to pricier stations like the ASDA at Audley Avenue in Trafford, where petrol is 135.9p. For diesel, that same ASDA in Bolton is also the best deal at 132.7p. Petrol prices in the region are below the national average, with local drivers enjoying savings of about 2p per litre. The data for these prices comes from a live feed set up by the government's Competition and Markets Authority, and most major retailers are part of it. If you’re looking for the best spots to fill up across Manchester, other deals include ASDA in Rochdale at 124.9p and various Tesco and Morrisons in the area. There’s also a helpful interactive widget to find the closest fuel station to you.
