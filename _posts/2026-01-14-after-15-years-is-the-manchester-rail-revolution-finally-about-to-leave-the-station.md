After years of delays and false promises, Manchester's rail revolution seems to be on the horizon with a new Liverpool-Manchester line finally getting the go-ahead. Alongside this, plans for an underground Piccadilly station and a revived Manchester-Birmingham route are being considered in a £1.1 billion transport investment for the North. These improvements aim to cut Liverpool-Manchester travel times to 35 minutes, enhancing services significantly. Local leaders like Andy Burnham and Bev Craig fought hard for underground solutions, arguing against the negative impacts of overground structures on Manchester's growth. The government, previously resistant, has now agreed to review the underground proposal. Expected construction could start in 2033, with a possible opening in 2037. This marks a significant development following years of frustration and underinvestment, with local figures expressing optimism about finally achieving their vision for improved rail links. Burnham highlighted this as a turning point, saying it brings the North closer to much-needed investment and a better transport network.
