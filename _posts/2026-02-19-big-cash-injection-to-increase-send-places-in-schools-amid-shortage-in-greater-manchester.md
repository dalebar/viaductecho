Tameside council has approved a £5.3m funding boost to establish three new specialist units for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in mainstream schools, set to welcome 118 new pupils by September 2026. The new Specialist Resource Provisions will be located at Laurus Ryecroft, Ashton West End Primary Academy, and St Stephen’s RC Primary School. Funding includes £4.3m from the High Needs Capital Grant and £1m for Cromwell High School’s expansion, which will also feature a temporary satellite site for 40 students in Hyde. Coun Leanne Feeley highlighted the importance of this initiative in addressing long-term funding challenges and ensuring educational opportunities for SEND students across various towns in the borough. This investment follows the addition of 133 places for the 2025 school term and aligns with the Council's SEND Sufficiency Strategy aimed at providing suitable local settings for children with additional needs.
