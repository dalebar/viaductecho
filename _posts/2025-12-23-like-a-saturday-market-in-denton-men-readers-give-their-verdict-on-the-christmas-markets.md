The annual Manchester Christmas markets spark a fierce debate every November, with opinions split on whether they're a festive delight or a sign of decline. Despite criticisms, the markets saw bustling crowds since opening, although traders reported mixed experiences, with some declaring it their worst year in 20. Many comments on social media highlighted grievances over high prices, with locals feeling the cost-of-living crunch. Observations included a lack of traditional stalls and a shift from artisan goods to an overwhelming number of food options, leading to complaints about the market's festive spirit fading. Some users drew comparisons to European markets, noting better quality and lower prices abroad. There’s a sense that the markets have lost their charm, being seen more as a food festival than a traditional market, prompting calls for a return to roots. Several argued the markets have peaked, suggesting they might be overdue for a rethink or overhaul to reclaim their original festive appeal.
