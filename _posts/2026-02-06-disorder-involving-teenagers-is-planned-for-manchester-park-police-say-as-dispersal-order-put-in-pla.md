A dispersal order has been implemented in south Manchester due to concerns of planned disorder involving local teenagers. This order, enforced by GMP, is in effect from 2pm on February 5 until 2am on February 7 and allows police to exclude individuals from the area for 36 hours. The order covers Monton Street, Denmark Road, Oxford Road, and Moss Lane East, including spots like the University of Manchester and Manchester Academy. Neighbourhood Inspector Zac Campbell stated that these measures aim to prevent further disruptions and keep the area safe. He emphasized a zero-tolerance stance on antisocial behaviour and encouraged anyone with concerns or information to approach the extra patrols present. For reporting, the police can be contacted via 101 or through their website, quoting log 1619 of 09/12/25, and there's an option to reach out anonymously to Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111.
