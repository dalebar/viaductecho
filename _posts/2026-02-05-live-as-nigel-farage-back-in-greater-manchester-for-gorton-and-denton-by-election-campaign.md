Nigel Farage is in Manchester today to back Reform UK's candidate Matt Goodwin in the Gorton and Denton by-election. Goodwin, a local with roots in Greater Manchester, emphasised that this election acts as a 'referendum on Keir Starmer'. The by-election follows a noteworthy turn of events where Andy Burnham expressed interest in the constituency but was turned away by Labour. 

Farage heavily critiqued PM's recent handling of a scandal involving Peter Mandelson, labelling it as the biggest scandal in a century and weakly apologetic. He believes the Reform UK party positions itself as a strong anti-Starmer alternative. The campaign HQ has officially opened, with Farage and Goodwin cutting the ribbon as they gear up for canvassing. A good number of party members have gathered, all rallying behind Goodwin, who proudly states that 'Manchester made me'.
