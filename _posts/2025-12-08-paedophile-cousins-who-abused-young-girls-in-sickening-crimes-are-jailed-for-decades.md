Two cousins, Manzorr Hussain, 54, and Imtiaz Ali, 53, have been sentenced for grooming and sexually abusing five vulnerable girls in Bury during the late 1990s. They gave their victims drink and drugs, exploiting their troubled backgrounds to carry out a “campaign of rape.” The abuse took place at various locations in Greater Manchester and Wales, with Hussain jailed for 30 years and Ali for 28. A third man, Ghulam Hussain, is charged in connection but has fled the country. During the trial, the court heard how the cousins manipulated the girls, leading to severe emotional trauma, as expressed in a victim's statement highlighting years of shame and fear. The judge condemned their lack of remorse and noted the severity of their actions, categorising it as systematic exploitation. Both men will serve two-thirds of their sentences before being listed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.
