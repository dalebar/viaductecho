The Avro Heritage Museum in Stockport is gearing up to expand its vintage aircraft collection, with six previously hidden warplanes set to be unveiled. Opened a decade ago on the site of a historic BAE Systems factory, the museum features notable aircraft like a Lancaster bomber replica and an Avro Type F model. The chairman, Terry Barnes, mentioned the need for a new display space for the six planes, which date from 1908 to 2011, to honour the legacy of the Avro company, a key player in Manchester's aviation scene.

The proposed £10m extension has received council approval and will kick off a fundraising campaign later this year. The museum currently attracts around 13,000 visitors annually, but hopes the expansion will boost numbers to 20,000. Many of the newly displayed planes were once at Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry, including a long-range maritime patrol aircraft and a prototype that influenced the design of the Vulcan bomber and Concorde. It’s an exciting time for aviation enthusiasts in the region!
