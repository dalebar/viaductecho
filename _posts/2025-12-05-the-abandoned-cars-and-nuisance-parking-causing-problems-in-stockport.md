Councillors in Marple are looking at installing retractable bollards next to the historic canal locks to tackle issues with abandoned cars and rubbish dumping. Cars have been left along a road near Marple Aqueduct, particularly from the nearby Aqueduct Business Park, causing a nuisance. There's been ongoing frustration among residents, especially as the area is being considered for World Heritage status. A representative from the Canal and River Trust mentioned they've faced several complaints and even spent a significant portion of their budget on removal efforts, which have not solved the problem. Councillor Steve Gribbon highlighted the fly-tipping issue, with a variety of waste being dumped, creating an eyesore and attracting pests. During a recent committee meeting, it was proposed to improve communication with the Canal and River Trust and create a working group to discuss the best steps forward, including the installation of bollards to restrict vehicle access.
