A former mill known as The Ropeworks in Heaton Norris is up for sale, complete with planning permission for 34 new homes—30 apartments and four houses. Originally approved for conversion in 2016, the site has had a rocky journey. A developer planned to invest £6.5m for luxury apartments in 2020, but those plans fell through, leaving the mill empty and deteriorating. Local residents raised concerns about falling debris. However, in Summer 2024, Stockport Council granted further planning permission, paving the way for new developments. The sale, listed by Landwood Group, invites offers, with a focus on preserving the mill's original facade while giving it a new purpose. The site is ideally located near Manchester Road and various connections, making it a potential hotspot for residential living.
