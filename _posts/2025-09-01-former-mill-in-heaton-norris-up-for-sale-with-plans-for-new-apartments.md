The Ropeworks, a former mill in Heaton Norris, is up for sale as a residential development opportunity, complete with planning permission for 34 new homes—30 apartments and four houses. Initially approved for conversion in 2016, plans stalled after a developer bought the site in 2020 and intended to invest £6.5m, but the project never materialised, leaving the building empty and deteriorating. However, recent planning permission from Stockport Council in Summer 2024 has reignited hopes for redevelopment. The site is conveniently located near Manchester Road and other key areas. The new plans aim to retain the original facade while revitalising the building, promising to safeguard this piece of local history. Interested buyers can submit offers, though no price has been officially stated.
