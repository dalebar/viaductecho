Manchester's set to see over 700 'genuinely affordable' homes popping up across 17 neighbourhoods, the most in a decade. Council leader Bev Craig highlighted that every new build will be affordable, with a strong focus on social housing. This push to boost affordable homes is part of the council's housing strategy and has been made possible through solid partnerships with local housing providers. More council land is being used for new builds than since 2015, and they’re not just meeting targets but exceeding them. A key decision on at least 400 of these homes, particularly in Gorton, will be confirmed at an executive meeting on October 15. The planned developments will be discussed in detail then, with the meeting available to view online.
