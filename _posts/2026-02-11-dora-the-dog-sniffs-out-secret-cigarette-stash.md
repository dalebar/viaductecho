The 7 Day Stop shop in Sale, Trafford, has been shut down after a sniffer dog named Dora uncovered a hidden stash of illegal cigarettes and tobacco in a safe above the back room. Officers seized over 1,200 cigarettes, hand-rolling tobacco, and vapes. The shop was given a three-month closure following a court order after staff refused to open the safe. During a follow-up visit, it was found that the compartment was being rebuilt. Attempts were made to change the registered directors after the enforcement action, with ties to another shop previously shut down for similar issues. Trafford Council is resolute in tackling the sale of illicit tobacco, emphasising a zero-tolerance policy. Councillor Rose Thompson highlighted that such actions aim to protect the community and maintain fairness for legitimate traders.
