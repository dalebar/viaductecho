International film star Jason Momoa has touched down in Manchester to promote his new vodka brand, Meili Vodka. Dressed in a United jacket, the Aquaman and Dune actor visited Fenix, The Goods Yard on February 1. His appearance aligns with the Prime Video debut of his upcoming film, The Wrecking Crew, featuring Dave Bautista. Momoa emphasised that Meili is all about quality, sustainability, and sharing drinks with good company, noting Manchester's vibrant energy made it a fitting launch location. He partnered with Permanently Unique, which aligns with Meili's vision, and the vodka will be available in their Manchester venues like Fenix, Louis, and Tattu. Drew Jones from Permanently Unique expressed excitement about the collaboration, highlighting their shared goal of creating memorable experiences. Later in the evening, Momoa will perform with his band ÖOF TATATÁ at Louis.
