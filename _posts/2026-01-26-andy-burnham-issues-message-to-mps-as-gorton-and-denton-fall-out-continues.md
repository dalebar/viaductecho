Andy Burnham's bid to stand for Labour in the Gorton and Denton by-election has been rejected by the party's National Executive Committee, despite his application earlier this week. Keir Starmer voted against it, citing concerns about diverting resources from essential elections. Although disappointed, Burnham has pledged to focus on his mayoral role and made light of the situation at various public engagements, including a joke about reading reports over the weekend. He urged Labour MPs to support the upcoming by-election and emphasised Greater Manchester’s ethos of togetherness and collaboration. Burnham's schedule remains packed with meetings for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority this week.
