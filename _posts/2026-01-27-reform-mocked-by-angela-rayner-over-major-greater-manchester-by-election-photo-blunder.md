Reform UK is facing backlash for allegedly campaigning in the wrong area ahead of the Gorton and Denton by-election. Lee Anderson MP, the party’s chief whip, posted pictures of himself and activists outside Stanley House Functions Rooms, claiming it was a productive day in Gorton and Denton. However, it turned out that the location is actually in Ashton-under-Lyne, the constituency of Angela Rayner MP. She mockingly noted that Reform can’t even locate Gorton and Denton on a map, insisting that local residents need a dedicated MP focused on their priorities, such as the cost of living. Labour Party Chair Anna Turley echoed these sentiments, emphasising that while Reform struggles with directions, Labour is actively engaging with voters to address their concerns. The by-election, triggered by former MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation due to health issues, is scheduled for February 26, and although candidates have yet to be announced, Reform UK plans to reveal theirs soon.
