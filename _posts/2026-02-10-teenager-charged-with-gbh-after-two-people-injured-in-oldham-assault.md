A 17-year-old boy has been charged with several offences, including grievous bodily harm (GBH), following a serious assault in Oldham that injured two people. The police received reports of the incident on Longley Street around 5pm on February 5, with a man suffering serious injuries and a woman having minor injuries. A 47-year-old man was also arrested for suspicion of assault. Now, the 17-year-old has been remanded in custody and will appear in court today. In addition to the GBH charge, he faces two counts of robbery, witness intimidation, and offences related to the possession and use of a bladed article in public.
