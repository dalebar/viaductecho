The Magnet Pub in Heaton Norris has snagged the title of 'best mild pub' during the annual Mild Magic Ale Trail, organised by CAMRA. Ale lovers enjoyed a fab selection of nine different mild ales at The Magnet, which helped it stand out among the 101 participating pubs in Stockport and South Manchester. This year saw a whopping 5,500 pub visits and a 25% bump in participants tackling the trailâ€™s challenges. The highlight was Blackjack Dark Ruby being voted the best mild ale, available at various venues. Outgoing organiser Darren Berry expressed gratitude to all the pubs and attendees for supporting this traditional ale style, noting record participation and the highest number of milds yet. With a recent win for Penzance Mild as Champion Beer of Britain, mild ales are gaining popularity. Keep an eye out for the next Mild Magic trail set for Spring 2026!
