The Magnet Pub in Heaton Norris has been crowned 'best mild pub' by local ale fans during the annual Mild Magic Ale Trail, organised by CAMRA. The pub impressed with its ever-changing selection of nine mild ales, leading to an estimated 5,500 visits across Stockport and South Manchester. This year, 260 participants took on the trail's challenges, showing a 25% increase in involvement, with some even hitting every one of the 101 pubs! 

Voters picked Blackjack Dark Ruby as the top mild ale, available at various locations. Outgoing organiser Darren Berry applauded the pubs and breweries for promoting mild ales, noting the record participation and variety of offerings this year. With Penzance Mild recently winning Champion Beer of Britain, the profile of mild ales is on the rise. Keep an eye out for the next Mild Magic event in Spring 2026!
