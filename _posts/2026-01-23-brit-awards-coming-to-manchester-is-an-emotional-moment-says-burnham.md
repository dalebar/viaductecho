Andy Burnham's been keen to see Manchester host major events, and it's finally happening with the Brit Awards moving to Co-op Live next month. For the first time, the awards will take place outside London, marking a huge milestone for the city known for its rich musical history with icons like Oasis and The Stone Roses. Mayor Burnham expressed his pride, highlighting Manchester as the UK's most vibrant city after a long journey back to prominence. The BRIT trophy will also feature a unique design by Matthew Williamson, inspired by the city’s Worker Bee icon. With Manchester's music scene flourishing, last summer alone attracted 1.2 million music fans, and Burnham notes the city has an impressive venue infrastructure. Councillor Bev Craig added that the city is committed to supporting both past and emerging talent, ensuring grassroots venues thrive. The success of Co-op Live alongside the AO Arena challenges the idea that a city outside London can't host multiple major venues, proving Manchester's place on the musical map.
