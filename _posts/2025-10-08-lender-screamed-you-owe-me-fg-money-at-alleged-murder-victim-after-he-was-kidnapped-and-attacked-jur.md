Jemma Marshall and Jason Wadsworth are on trial for the murder of Martin Shaw, who allegedly owed money to Marshall, described as a "money lender." Jurors heard that on September 10, 2023, Shaw was reportedly kidnapped and assaulted after being forced into Marshall's car. Prosecutors claim he was hit multiple times while being driven around Oldham, with Marshall shouting about blood in her car and demanding her money. Shaw was later found at home covered in blood, leading to hospitalisation for severe injuries, including damage to his spleen and ribs; he ultimately died from liver failure 55 days later. Evidence suggests Shaw was in debt due to drug issues and had borrowed money from Marshall, who reportedly inflated these debts. Both defendants deny the murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter, insisting Shaw entered the car voluntarily and they only encountered him by chance. Wadsworth admitted to delivering a light punch but denied further involvement. The trial is ongoing.
