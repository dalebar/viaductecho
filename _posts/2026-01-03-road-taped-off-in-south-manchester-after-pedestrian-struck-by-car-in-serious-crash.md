A serious collision involving a pedestrian occurred on Kingsway in Burnage, south Manchester, on Friday evening, January 2. The road was taped off by police, who received reports of the crash around 6:42 PM. Witnesses reported a heavy police presence and extensive sirens, with one noting, "It's totally blocked. Traffic is carnage." Paramedics treated the injured pedestrian at the scene before rushing them to the hospital, though their condition remains unclear. Kingsway was closed from near Heathwood Road, close to the Aldi supermarket, while investigations by the Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU) took place. Police advised people to avoid the area as the cordon would stay up for several hours, and it’s not clear if there have been any arrests. Traffic impacts were also reported on nearby roads, including Fog Lane and Southlea Road.
