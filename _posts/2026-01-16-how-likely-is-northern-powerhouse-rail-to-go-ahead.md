Greater Manchester's long-awaited railway improvements are finally looking promising after 17 years of delays and dashed hopes. The Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project aims to connect Manchester to Liverpool and enhance trans-Pennine links, possibly converging at a new underground Piccadilly station. This revival of the project follows years of changing plans, including the scrapping of crucial HS2 plans and setbacks under various governments. Recently, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a £45 billion budget for NPR, but only £1.1 billion has been allocated so far for preliminary work and feasibility studies. Despite lingering scepticism from Manchester’s leaders, like Mayor Andy Burnham, they are determined to push the project through, suggesting the 2027 spending review is crucial for securing further funding. Both Burnham and council boss Bev Craig believe increasing momentum will make it difficult for future governments to abandon the NPR plans. The coming year may determine whether Greater Manchester can finally realise its railway dreams or face yet another setback.
