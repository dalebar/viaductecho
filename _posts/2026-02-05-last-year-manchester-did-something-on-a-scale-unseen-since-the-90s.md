Manchester's building activity has hit a decade low, with only 8,023 homes under construction in 2025, falling below 10,000 for the first time since 2016. The Deloitte Crane Survey revealed just 17 projects started last year, a dip from previous lows. Despite this slowdown, experts aren't too worried; John Cooper from Deloitte mentions that while inflation and regulatory changes have slowed things down, the city's residential construction remains strong. Researcher India Gerritsen from IPPR North believes Manchester's economy will bounce back, especially with forecasts suggesting a rise to 5,473 new homes in 2026, near the 2021 record. There's a shift in focus towards building affordable homes, as the council leader Bev Craig emphasised the need for safe, secure housing for residents. Beyond housing, office space and student accommodation are thriving, with record levels of development. New regulations regarding fire safety are altering the landscape, pushing developers towards more student-oriented projects. Overall, there's high confidence in Manchester's future growth, reflecting a commitment to creating thriving communities.
