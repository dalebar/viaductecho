Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old terrorist, launched an attack outside the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Manchester, killing two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz. During the assault, he called 999, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, and was reported to have shouted about revenge for the deaths of children. He drove his car at worshippers and wielded a knife before being shot dead by police; tragically, Mr. Daulby was killed by a stray police bullet while trying to secure the synagogue. Three others, including a security guard and a CST worker, sustained serious injuries. Al-Shamie, originally from Syria and a British citizen since 2006, was on bail for a rape allegation at the time. Police are investigating his motivations, noting potential influence from extremist ideology. Accusations of abuse emerged from his past relationships, with one woman stating he attempted to brainwash her into extreme views.
