A light aircraft crashed in Littleborough today, leading to a significant emergency response from police, paramedics, and firefighters. Two people were reportedly on board, and while no serious injuries have been confirmed, a parachute was seen deployed before the crash, becoming tangled in a nearby pylon. The plane, a Cirrus SR20, had departed Birmingham Airport around 10 am and was observed flying for about 40 minutes before losing altitude and crashing in farmland near Hollingworth Lake. Local residents described hearing unusual engine sounds prior to the incident and reported a considerable emergency presence in the area. Greater Manchester Police, along with the Air Accident Investigation Branch, are investigating. Residents are urged to avoid the area while officials assess the situation. The National Grid confirmed there was no damage to the pylon and are collaborating with emergency services to ensure public safety.
