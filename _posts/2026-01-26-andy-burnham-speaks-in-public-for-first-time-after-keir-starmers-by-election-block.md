Andy Burnham made his first public appearance since being blocked from running in the Gorton and Denton by-election, dodging questions from the press as he entered a ‘Class Ceiling’ event at The Whitworth gallery. During his keynote speech, he briefly acknowledged the situation with a joke but largely focused on the Class Ceiling report, which highlights struggles faced by creatives from working-class backgrounds. Burnham expressed disappointment about the NEC's decision and emphasised his commitment to his mayoral duties and the importance of unity within the Labour Party. He later attended a technical education event, reiterating his focus on his current role rather than the by-election. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Keir Starmer voiced his support for Burnham, citing their good working relationship and stressing the importance of upcoming elections while addressing internal party tensions. Burnham called for more youth placements in the arts, reflecting on his own experiences, and underscored the need to maintain Manchester's working-class roots amidst concerns of the city's gentrification.
