Choosing where to buy in Greater Manchester can feel like a bit of a maze, especially for first-time buyers and families. M.E.N. consulted local estate agents to highlight six promising areas for house hunters in 2026. 

Didsbury remains a top pick, offering a village vibe, strong community, and great schools, though it’s pricier, averaging around £432,400. Failsworth, a hidden gem, is affordable at about £222,360 and boasts excellent transport links and schools, making it popular with families. Middleton is set for a popularity boost due to regeneration efforts, with an average price of £220,940.

Further afield, Reddish is gaining traction for its value and green spaces, while Wigan shines as the most affordable area at £187,800. For those priced out of hotspots, agents suggest looking nearby—for instance, rather than Chorlton, consider Stretford.

Overall, the region offers a mix of vibrant communities, local amenities, and potential for future growth, making it an exciting place to hunt for a home.
