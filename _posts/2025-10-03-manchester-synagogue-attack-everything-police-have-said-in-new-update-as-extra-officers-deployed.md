Following a tragic terror attack in Crumpsall, where two men tragically lost their lives, Greater Manchester Police are ramping up security across the region. The assailant, Jihad Al-Shamie, drove into worshippers outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation on Yom Kippur before launching a knife attack. The victims, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, have been named, with four others injured, three seriously. 

In response, extra officers will be visible in North Manchester, Bury, and Salford, particularly around Jewish communities and synagogues. Chief Superintendent David Meeney reassured the public that the police aim to provide safety and comfort during this sensitive time. 

Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, entered the UK as a child and had no prior record with police or security services. Neighbours reported seeing him recently, but he hadn't been identified as a threat. Police continue to support the victims' families while investigations are ongoing.
