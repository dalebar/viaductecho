Stockport's set for some big changes in 2026, affecting local roads and rail travel. Key updates include ongoing work on Greek Street and the Armoury Roundabout, with diversions in place until spring as new bridge beams are installed. 

Flood-defence projects will kick off too, causing disruptions in Bramhall as a 1000m³ underground tank is built near the precinct, shutting the car park for a year from January. Other projects include a 500m³ tank at Cheadle Golf Club, massive storm tanks at the Stockport wastewater plant, and a 650m³ tank in the town centre, all aimed at improving water quality.

On the rail side, Manchester Piccadilly will see a one-week closure from February 14 to 22 for major upgrades, affecting services primarily from the south and east of the city. Limited services will operate from platforms 13 and 14. It’s a lot to take in, so getting clued up early is a solid plan!
