A man was arrested after a rooftop stand-off with police in Chorlton on Boxing Day night. Emergency services arrived at Oswald Road around 6pm, where the area was cordoned off near local businesses. Firefighters supported the police for over an hour. Footage online shows the man gesturing while standing on the roof in a hoodie. Greater Manchester Police confirmed the arrest was due to breach of licence conditions, but no more details about the man or the incident have been released.
