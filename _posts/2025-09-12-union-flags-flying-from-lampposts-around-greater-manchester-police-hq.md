Union flags have popped up on lampposts around Greater Manchester Police's HQ in Newton Heath, part of a growing trend across the UK. The local council is dealing with the flags on a safety basis, removing those that could pose risks, while others that are deemed safe will remain. Manchester City Council aims for the flags to represent unity and pride among residents, stressing that they should be a welcoming symbol rather than divisive. Theyâ€™ve stated that any affected road markings will be restored to ensure public safety. The mixed reactions to the flag displays reflect the diverse opinions on the matter.
