A woman named Jacinta Owen, a DJ from St Helens, reflects on her early experiences at the iconic Manchester nightclub Sankeys, set to reopen soon. Established in 1994, Sankeys hosted legendary acts like Daft Punk and was pivotal in Jacinta's journey to becoming a DJ. At 17, while working an office job above the club, she was drawn to the vibrant atmosphere and exceptional music. Her time at Sankeys inspired her passion for electronic music and DJing, transforming her from a timid girl into someone deeply involved in the scene. Although the club closed in 2017, its reopening in a new 500-capacity venue, complete with a no-phones policy, has her buzzing with excitement. She’s keen to see how it compares to the old days and hopes it carries forward the club’s beloved spirit. Jacinta's story captures the profound impact of Sankeys on her life and reflects the broader love for the Manchester nightlife scene.
