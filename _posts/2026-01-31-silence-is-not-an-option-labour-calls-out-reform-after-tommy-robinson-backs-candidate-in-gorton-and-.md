Labour is pressing Reform UK's Gorton and Denton by-election candidate, Matthew Goodwin, to clarify if he accepts the backing of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, following Robinson's public endorsement on social media. Labour Party chair Anna Turley has demanded that Goodwin either denounce Robinson or face accusations of aligning with far-right views. A spokesman for Reform UK insists Robinson is not welcome in the party. In the mix, the Green Party is fielding candidate Hannah Spencer, urging voters to choose them over Reform, framing the election as a battle between 'hope and hate'. Green leader Zack Polanski, a local, endorsed Spencer, claiming she’s genuinely committed to the community. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have also entered the race with Jackie Pearcey. Labour is set to unveil their candidate soon.
