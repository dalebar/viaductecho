Jet2 has permanently banned two passengers following a violent altercation on a flight from Turkey to Manchester. Flight LS896 had to make an emergency stop in Brussels due to their disruptive behaviour, which was captured on social media. Belgian police arrested the men, who were deemed "still drunk," and they have since been allowed to resume their journey. Jet2 is pursuing costs for the disruption and has stated their commitment to a zero-tolerance policy on such behaviour. An investigation for intentional assault and battery is ongoing, with authorities compiling reports for further action. The airline expressed regret for the distress caused to other passengers and crew.
