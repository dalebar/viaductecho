It's the last weekend before Christmas, and it's set to be a lively one with last-minute shopping and festive vibes. Weather-wise, Saturday is looking decent with sunny intervals, highs around 9C, and a slight chance of rain. The evening will cool to 7C. Sunday brings cloudier skies and temperatures peaking at 10C, along with a good chance of rain later on. For the week ahead in Greater Manchester, expect generally cloudy conditions with highs of 10C and a chilly low of 4C on Christmas Day. The North West will mostly enjoy sunny spells on Saturday, but Sunday will be duller with occasional drizzle. Overall, it looks like next week will start off cloudy and damp before getting a bit colder and possibly brighter with an easterly breeze. Stay warm out there!
