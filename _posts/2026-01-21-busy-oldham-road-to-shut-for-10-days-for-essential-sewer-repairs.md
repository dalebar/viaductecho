The A62 road in Oldham is closing for ten days starting January 30 for essential sewer repairs by United Utilities. The closure will affect the stretch from junction 22 of the M60 at Hollinwood to Drury Lane, which frequently suffers from rush-hour congestion. This closure is likely to cause significant disruption since it’s a key route into Oldham town centre. United Utilities, in collaboration with National Highways and Oldham Council, aims to minimise inconvenience, with the work expected to wrap up by February 8. They’ve issued an apology for any hassle this may cause.
