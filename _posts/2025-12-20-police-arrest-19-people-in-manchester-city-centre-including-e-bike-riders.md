Nineteen people, including dangerous e-bike riders, have been arrested in Manchester as part of a crackdown on city centre crime ahead of Christmas. Both uniformed and plain-clothed officers are on the streets to tackle shoplifting, anti-social behaviour, and violence against women, while also bolstering security for local pubs and bars. The initiative, named Operation North Star, has led to drug possession arrests, seizures of seven e-bikes and scooters, and traffic offence reports. Six arrests were made thanks to a live facial recognition van in Piccadilly Gardens. Assistant Chief Constable Matt Boyle highlighted robust plans to keep everyone safe during the busy festive period, emphasizing the presence of high-visibility teams and advanced technology. Crime stats show anti-social behaviour has fallen by 14% and retail crime by 12.5% compared to last year, attributed to a comprehensive policing approach. The operation will continue throughout December and January across all ten districts, aiming to prevent crime and ensure a safe festive experience for everyone.
