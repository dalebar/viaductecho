Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) has blocked Andy Burnham from running in the Gorton and Denton by-election to prevent an unnecessary byelection for the Greater Manchester mayoralty. Burnham had sought permission from the NEC but was denied, as holding two simultaneous campaigns could drain party resources ahead of local elections and votes for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd in May. The NEC believes maintaining Labour’s control in Greater Manchester is crucial, especially as Burnham is doing a solid job as mayor. This decision comes after former MP Andrew Gwynne announced he’d step down due to health issues. The Gorton and Denton by-election is likely to coincide with the local elections on May 7. Labour is now focusing on a positive campaign aimed at addressing the cost of living crisis and attracting investment to the area.
