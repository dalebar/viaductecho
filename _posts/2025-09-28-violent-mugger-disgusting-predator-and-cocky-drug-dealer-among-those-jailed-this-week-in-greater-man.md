This week, several offenders have been sentenced in Greater Manchester. Lewis Orrell received over three years in prison for violently mugging a woman struggling with her umbrella in the rain. Similarly, predator Matthew Webb was sentenced to 28 years for a long campaign of sexual abuse against a young girl. Drug dealer Jordan Winstanley was jailed for eight years after boasting he’d never be caught, and his associate, Carl Allan, got two years and three months for supplying drugs. Ben Atherton, a kingpin operating a dedicated drugs line, was handed nine years for dispensing class A drugs. Lastly, Stuart James transformed an old café into a drugs lab, leading to a seven-and-a-half-year sentence after police uncovered over 17,000 ecstasy tablets. The Manchester Evening News is closely following these serious cases as justice is served.
