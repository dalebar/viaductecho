James Saxon, 29, from Stockport, has been sentenced to two years and three months in prison for a disturbing pattern of abusive and coercive behaviour towards his victim over three years. His actions included physical intimidation, isolation from friends and family, and assault, all worsened by his drug use. The victim, who was pregnant during the abuse, described living in constant fear and recounted horrendous incidents where Saxon's behaviour escalated to threats while driving. Despite the trauma he inflicted, Saxon displayed a shocking lack of remorse, even laughing during court proceedings. Greater Manchester Police highlighted the severe emotional toll of such coercive control, stressing the importance of victims coming forward. The case serves as a warning that this kind of behaviour won't be tolerated and that help is available for those in similar situations. A five-year restraining order has also been imposed on Saxon.
