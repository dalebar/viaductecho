Manchester Airport is undergoing significant changes, especially in Terminal 1, which had been mainly Ryanair's hub since it closed most services on November 19. The focus of the airport's upgrades is Terminal 2, which has seen over £1.3 billion invested in improvements, opening new facilities and handling the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane. The recent reshuffle saw EasyJet and Emirates move to Terminal 2, prompting a need for Terminal 1’s eventual closure, expected early next year. Until then, Ryanair passengers still use a portion of Terminal 1 but must head to Terminal 3 for gate amenities. Terminal 3 is also set for an upgrade, adding new security equipment and expanded lounge space. Managing director Chris Woodroofe expressed excitement about the developments, highlighting the transformational journey of the airport and its ability to compete with major European hubs. Passengers are encouraged to share their experiences with the revamped facilities in the months to come.
