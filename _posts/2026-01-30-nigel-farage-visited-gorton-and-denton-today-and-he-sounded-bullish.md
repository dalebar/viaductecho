Labour’s decision to block Andy Burnham from running in the Gorton and Denton by-election has boosted Reform UK’s chances, according to Nigel Farage. He claims that Burnham would have been the anti-Starmer candidate, which would have split votes in Labour’s favour. With Burnham out of the race, Farage asserts that Reform’s Matt Goodwin now holds that position. Burnham’s hopes dashed after Labour’s NEC voted against his candidacy, citing resource concerns for the upcoming mayoral election in Manchester. Despite Labour's strong presence in the area, Farage believes Reform has a solid chance, highlighting that their candidate stands for momentum in the north. He noted the context remains uncertain, with potential challenges from Labour, the Greens, and possibly George Galloway. The Gorton and Denton by-election is set for February 26.
