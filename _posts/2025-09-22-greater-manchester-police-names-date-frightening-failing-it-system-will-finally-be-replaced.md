Greater Manchester Police is set to replace its problematic computer system, iOPS, in 2027—eight years after issues first cropped up in 2019. The £27 million software faced serious criticism early on, with officers claiming it hampered their ability to do their jobs and raised concerns for public safety. By December 2020, an inspection revealed that PoliceWorks failed to record 80,000 crimes within a year, prompting leadership changes, including the resignation of then-Chief Constable Ian Hopkins. Current Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson announced the replacement last March as part of efforts to turn the force around. While a new Record Management System (RMS) with preferred bidder Mark43 is set to be finalised soon, delays have pushed its introduction to spring 2027. Deputy Mayor Kate Green stressed the importance of getting the new system right, acknowledging the lengthy procurement process. GMP aims to ensure the new RMS aligns with operational needs, drawing insights from officers involved in day-to-day policing.
