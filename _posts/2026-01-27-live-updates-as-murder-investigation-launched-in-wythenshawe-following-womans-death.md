A murder investigation is underway in Wythenshawe after the tragic death of a woman in her 30s on Lulworth Gardens. Police responded to reports of a disturbance around 8.30am on January 27, where they found the woman unresponsive. Despite attempts at CPR, she was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody.

Superintendent Gayle Brister reassured the community that there's no wider risk to the public and that officers are diligently working to uncover the details of the incident. Witnesses reported the victim banging on a neighbour’s door seeking help before the police arrived. A police cordon remains at the location, with forensic teams actively investigating.

Residents have expressed their shock over the event, and police are urging anyone with information to contact them via the GMP LiveChat or call 101, quoting log 516. Anonymous tips can also be provided to Crimestoppers. The situation is still developing, and updates will follow as more details emerge.
