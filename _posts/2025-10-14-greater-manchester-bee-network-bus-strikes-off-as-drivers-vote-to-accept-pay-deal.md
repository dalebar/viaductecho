Bus strikes in Greater Manchester have been called off after drivers accepted a new pay deal from Metroline and Stagecoach. The initial strike, which would have impacted around 190 services, was averted last Thursday when drivers voted on a pay offer. The new deal includes a 12% pay rise over two years, starting with a backdated increase of 5.9% from April 2025 and another 5.9% this coming April, affecting all pay rates including for weekends and sick leave. Unite, the union representing the drivers, hailed it as a significant win for their members, highlighting the importance of collective action. Additionally, the deal improves conditions for Christmas working. Mayor Andy Burnham acknowledged the vital role bus drivers play in the Bee Network and expressed commitment to making Greater Manchester a great place for them. Overall, the unity among drivers has led to a substantial improvement in their pay and working conditions.
