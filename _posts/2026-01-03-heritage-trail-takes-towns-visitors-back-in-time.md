There's a fab free walking trail that invites everyone to dive into the town's rich history. You can wander past stunning Gothic architecture, hear tales of royal visits, and discover wartime stories, forgotten pubs, and even a site once used for public punishments. With QR codes along the route, you can access stories, photos, and personal accounts that bring the past to life. Mandy White from Altrincham Business Improvement District highlighted how this multimedia experience caters to both young and old, locals and visitors. Councillor Liz Patel mentioned it's a brilliant way to enjoy a fresh-air adventure. Don't forget to catch up with BBC Radio Manchester for more local gems!
