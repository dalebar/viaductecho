Marks & Spencer is set to open a new food store in Northwich, just outside Greater Manchester, which they claim will be one of their most modern yet. The store aims for an 18,000 sq ft space off Leicester Street and will feature a bakery, click and collect service, plus dedicated sections like a Flower Shop and Wine Shop. Operating hours will be Monday to Saturday from 8am and Sunday from 10am. This development comes as M&S returns to Northwich, following the closure of a department store six years ago. Local council member Nathan Pardoe called it “fantastic news” for the town. M&S has also been eyeing over 500 sites nationwide for new or revamped food stores, including potential locations across Greater Manchester like Oldham and West Cheadle. Planning permission for the Northwich store is set to be submitted soon, and public consultation is now underway.
