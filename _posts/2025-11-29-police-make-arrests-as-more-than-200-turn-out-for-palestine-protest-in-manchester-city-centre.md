Police in Manchester have arrested several individuals during a pro-Palestine protest that drew over 200 people to St Peter's Square. The demonstration began at Piccadilly Gardens and moved to the square near Central Library, where video footage showed officers escorting some protesters away. While the exact number of arrests and the reasons behind them are still unclear, onlookers in the crowd reacted with chants of "shame on you" and "we love you," alongside applause for the police actions. There were also counter-demonstrators present, flying Great Britain flags. The Manchester Evening News is seeking further details from Greater Manchester Police regarding the situation.
