Reform UK has announced Matt Goodwin, a GB News presenter and academic, as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election. Meanwhile, Labour's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, emphasised focusing party resources on essential elections. Approximately 50 Labour MPs have expressed their concerns through a letter, urging the NEC to rethink its decision on the by-election. Goodwin, known for his work on politics, has written extensively about populism, Brexit, and UKIP, another right-wing party once led by Nigel Farage.
