Thursday in Stockport is looking pretty grim, with overcast skies and rain expected by the afternoon. Temperatures will range from a comfy 16°C down to around 12°C, but with 80% humidity, it’ll feel quite damp. Expect strong winds at 27 mph, adding to the chilly, unsettled vibe. 

The day kicks off cloudy but dry for morning commuters—just a dreary sight ahead! As it rolls on, those clouds will get heavier, with rain hitting in the late afternoon. This could lead to some tricky travel conditions, so take care on the roads with potential slick spots and reduced visibility. It’s a good idea to leave some extra time to get where you’re going.

If you’re thinking of heading out, grab an umbrella and some waterproof gear. Better yet, considering the weather, you might want to stash away any loose outdoor items and plan for indoor activities as the evening sets in. Stay warm and dry out there!
