Two people were taken to hospital after a three-vehicle crash on the M60 in Greater Manchester on Sunday night, January 4. The incident, which happened near Whitefield around 7pm, blocked the clockwise carriageway between Junction 16 and Junction 17, causing major traffic delays. Emergency crews, including two fire engines, arrived promptly to assist, with firefighters using specialised equipment to make the scene safe. The motorway was closed for about an hour, reopening around 8:10pm. One of the injured was assessed by a trauma technician from the fire service before being transported by ambulance. Further details from the police are still awaited.
