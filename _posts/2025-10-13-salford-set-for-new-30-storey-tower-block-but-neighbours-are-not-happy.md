Salford Quays might see a new 30-storey tower with 141 apartments and 171 co-living homes if the council approves it this week. The planning committee will discuss the proposal on Thursday, despite objections from locals calling it an 'eyesore.' The site is by Clippers Quay, near Trafford Road and the Metrolink stop. While the development will feature lifestyle-focused communal areas like a gym, co-working spaces, and caf√©s, it lacks any affordable housing, which the applicant claims would make the project unviable. The council has received 164 comments from neighbours against the plans, with concerns about aesthetics and potential impacts on the already busy tram network. However, Salford council's officers have recommended approval, saying the proposals are generally acceptable. Last September, the committee approved a similar co-living tower with 568 units in the city centre, and another is planned near Langworthy Metrolink stop, set to be a ten-storey landmark.
