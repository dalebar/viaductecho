Police have identified the suspect in a tragic terror attack at a Manchester synagogue as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent. He was shot dead by police after launching a vehicle and knife attack, resulting in two fatalities and several injuries during Yom Kippur. Three others, including two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, are in custody under suspicion of terrorism-related offences. Fortunately, the suspect was not known to police prior to the attack. Emergency services responded promptly, and the suspect was shot within seven minutes of the first call. Security measures are being heightened at synagogues nationwide, with officials expressing horror over the situation and offering support to victims' families. The community is rallying together after this distressing incident, leaving a significant impact on Manchester.
