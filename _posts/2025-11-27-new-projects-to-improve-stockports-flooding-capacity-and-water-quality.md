United Utilities is kicking off major projects in Stockport over the next six months, investing £80 million to enhance the local water network. They're set to build new storage tanks to ease pressure on storm overflows, especially during heavy rainfall. The projects include a 500m³ tank at Cheadle Golf Club, aimed at improving the Micker Brook, due to be completed by late 2026. At the Stockport wastewater treatment works, they'll create 16,700m³ of new storm tanks, with initial work starting in 2026 and completion in 2028. Other tanks include a 1,000m³ tank near Bramhall Precinct and a 320m³ tank at Lumb Lane, both starting in early 2026. A 650m³ tank near Hope Street in the town centre will also be built to enhance water quality in the River Mersey, expected to be finished by late 2028. Local officials are welcoming the investment, especially after recent flooding, while ensuring minimal disruption to businesses during the works.
