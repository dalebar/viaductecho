Over 400 streets in Greater Manchester had their bins left uncollected after the Christmas and New Year period. Multiple councils have shared lists of affected roads due to challenges like icy conditions and increased parked cars after the holidays. Bolton experienced the highest number of missed collections, with 220 streets affected, while Salford and Bury reported around 110 and 60 missed, respectively. Manchester and Wigan reported no missed collections. Individual council websites provide guidance for residents on reporting missed pickups and whether to leave bins out for collection. Weather-related disruptions and operational issues have affected services, but crews are working to resolve the backlog. Some councils like Oldham and Rochdale mentioned minor disruptions, while Trafford noted issues from icy weather and staff shortages. Overall, councils are aiming to clear up the mess as quickly as possible.
