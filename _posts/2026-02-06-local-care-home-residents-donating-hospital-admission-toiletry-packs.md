Borough Care has kicked off a lovely initiative called 'Comfort to Share', aimed at providing essential toiletry packs to patients facing unexpected hospital stays or hardship. Residents at Hen Cloud House in Leek have been busy filling these packs with items like soap, toothpaste, and sanitary products. The campaign is in response to feedback from nurses who often find themselves buying essentials out of pocket for patients in need. Sharon Parkes, of Borough Care, highlighted how crucial this support is to both patients and hospital staff. Notably, resident Margaret, a former theatre nurse, contributed to the cause, adding a personal touch to the effort. Borough Care is now calling on the local community to pitch in by donating new, unused toiletry items at Hen Cloud House in Leek or Shoemaker Place in Stone. Interested donors can contact Sharon via email for more info.
