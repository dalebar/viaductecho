This week in Stockport is shaping up nicely, with mainly partly cloudy skies and mild temperatures from 2°C to 19°C. Wind speeds will be moderate, and there's little chance of rain, so it looks like a dry week ahead. 

- **Monday** starts at 14°C and drops to 2°C. 
- **Tuesday** gets a bit cloudier with highs of 16°C and a low of 4°C. 
- **Wednesday** mirrors Monday, peaking at 16°C. 
- **Thursday** warms up slightly to 17°C with still no rain. 
- **Friday** holds steady with another 17°C high. 
- **Saturday** sees temps rise to 18°C, but a slight increase in humidity and a 16% chance of rain. 
- **Sunday** wraps up the week with a sunny 19°C.

Compared to last week’s cooler, rainier weather, this week feels a lot more stable—perfect for outdoor fun! Commuters won’t face major disruptions, but a light jacket might be wise for the cooler mornings. And for the weekend, it's prime time for walks, picnics, or just enjoying the countryside!
