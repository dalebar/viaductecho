A major study into the weight loss drug Mounjaro has kicked off in Greater Manchester, with thousands set to participate. This five-year clinical trial will explore the effects of Tirzepatide, which is designed to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. Researchers aim to understand how the drug impacts job prospects and quality of life for those living with obesity in the area. Mounjaro, developed by Eli Lilly, suppresses appetite and helps regulate blood sugar. Although it’s not yet available on the NHS in Greater Manchester, the first group of patients has started treatment as part of the SURMOUNT-REAL UK trial, aiming to enrol up to 3,000 people. With around 600,000 residents affected by obesity, the study also highlights the economic burden of over £3 billion on the health service. Researchers will focus on the drug’s effectiveness and its potential to improve employment status. The introduction of Mounjaro will occur in phases, prioritising individuals at higher health risks. Community health professionals express pride in participating in this pivotal trial, aiming to include under-represented groups in research.
