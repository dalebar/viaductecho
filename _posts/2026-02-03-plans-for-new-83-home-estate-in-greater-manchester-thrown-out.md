Plans for an 83-home estate by Bellway Homes near Tyldesley Old Road and Douglas Road in Atherton have been turned down by Wigan council. The developers aimed to create a sustainable urban area but concerns were raised about the impact of nearby industrial noise from Chanters employment park on future residents. The council's planning report highlighted that the development wouldn’t meet local policies, as the necessary infrastructure wasn’t adequately addressed. It also warned that building homes could lead to pressures on the industrial estate's operations. The site, characterised as a suburban area, is surrounded by residential homes and light industrial buildings. The council faced 15 objections, citing issues like inadequate road access and proximity to overhead power lines. Ward councillor Debra Wailes opposed the project, noting that the site serves as a natural buffer between residential areas and the industrial estate, which would be compromised by the development.
