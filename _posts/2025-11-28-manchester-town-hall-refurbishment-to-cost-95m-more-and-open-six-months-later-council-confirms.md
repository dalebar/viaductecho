Manchester Town Hall's refurbishment will now cost £524.8 million and take an extra six months, aiming for a completion date in spring 2027. This marks a significant rise in costs—£95 million more than previously estimated—after delays caused by the pandemic and the discovery of new issues. Deputy council leader Garry Bridges expressed frustration but remains hopeful that funding won't need to increase further. The hall closed in 2018, with plans to reopen in 2024, but challenges like contractor failures have pushed timelines back. The council's commitment to local firms hasn’t hampered progress, according to project bosses. To celebrate the reopening, a year-long programme is planned for 2027, coinciding with the 150th anniversary, featuring events in the expanded Albert Square. The focus is on making the hall a public space for all Mancunians to enjoy, contributing to Manchester's vibrant culture moving forward.
