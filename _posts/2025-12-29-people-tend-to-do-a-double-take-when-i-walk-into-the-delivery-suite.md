Dan Minton, one of the few male midwives in Greater Manchester, shares his experiences as he marks one year in the role. At just 23, and having delivered 11 babies with 40 assists during training, he’s noticed a range of reactions when he walks into the delivery suite. Some are intrigued, while others may prefer a female midwife, but he respects those choices. Trained at John Moore’s University, Dan appreciates the solid support he’s received from colleagues. He loves empowering women through their birth experiences, aiming for a natural approach. His first solo delivery was memorable, especially because the expectant mother was a student midwife herself. Dan's positive influence has been acknowledged by senior staff, highlighting the importance of diverse backgrounds in healthcare. He’s proud to contribute to patient care and foster a friendly, reassuring environment for mothers.
