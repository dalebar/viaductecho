UK rents have risen by 2.2% in the last year, the slowest growth in four years, thanks to a tighter demand and supply situation. Demand fell by 20%, while rental homes increased by 15%. Previously, rents shot up faster than earnings, straining affordability, but now, rents are rising slower than wage growth, which should help renters' situations until 2026. 

In Greater Manchester, some areas experienced larger increases. Bolton's rents surged by 10.2%, averaging £866, while Bury saw a 6.4% rise to £961. Manchester's increase was modest at just 2.2%, averaging £1,330. Other boroughs like Oldham, Rochdale, and Salford saw rises of 5.8%, 6.7%, and 4.9%, respectively. Stockport's rents increased by 3.9%, while Tameside jumped by 7.6%. Trafford and Wigan rounded up with smaller increases of 2.3% and 5.6%, respectively. So, while things are easing a bit nationwide, the local rental scene is still feeling those price hikes, especially in some areas.
