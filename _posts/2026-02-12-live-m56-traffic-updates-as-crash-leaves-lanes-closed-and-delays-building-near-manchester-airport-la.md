There's quite a bit of congestion on the M56 westbound this evening after a crash between junctions 6 and 7, which has led to one lane being shut. Initially, two lanes were closed, causing significant delays of about 30 minutes. Emergency services were on the scene, and traffic was reported as slow moving with some drivers stuck for half an hour. However, the latest update indicates that all lanes have now reopened and traffic is flowing freely again. It was a hectic evening for those travelling that route, but patience seems to have paid off. Normal traffic conditions are expected to return soon, so if you're heading that way, stay safe!
