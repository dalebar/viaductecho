In a striking contrast of football histories, Oldham Athletic's last Premier League match of the 1993-1994 season attracted over 20,000 fans, while Bromley capped off their season with just 235 supporters present, 88 miles away. Oldham, with roots in the EFL since 1907, has been a notable contender, finishing as Division One runners-up in 1915. On the flip side, Bromley has mostly played in the lower tiers during their 133 years, spending 132 of those years below the top flight. The two teams have clashed only four times, all during their tenure in the National League, with Bromley holding an unbeaten record against Oldham (two wins, two draws). So far this season, Bromley has achieved three victories and four draws, including wins against Barnet, Cheltenham, and Harrogate.
