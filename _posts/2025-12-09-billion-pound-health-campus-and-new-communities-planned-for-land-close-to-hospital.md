A new £1 billion ‘health campus’ plan has been revealed near Royal Bolton Hospital, aimed at boosting health and wellbeing while driving economic growth in the area. This initiative, known as Health Innovation Bolton (HIB), involves a collaboration between Bolton Council, NHS, Peel Land, and various educational institutions. The ambitious scheme focuses on developing new homes, improving transport links, and enhancing public services such as water and utilities.

Plans include creating a primary transport corridor to reduce congestion, alongside better walking, cycling, and public transport schemes. The proposal is set to address significant health and social issues in Bolton, with new residential options like affordable homes and student accommodation, integrated within the community. Bolton Council’s leader highlights the opportunity to reduce inequality, while NHS representatives see potential improvements in health outcomes. Overall, HIB is about collective effort from public and private sectors to bring about positive, lasting change, with upcoming public consultations planned to engage the community further in the development process.
