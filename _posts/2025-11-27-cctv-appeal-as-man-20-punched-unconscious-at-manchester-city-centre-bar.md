CCTV footage has been released following an assault at a bar in Manchester's city centre, where a 20-year-old man was punched unconscious. The victim suffered serious injuries, including a fractured cheekbone and jaw, requiring surgery. The incident occurred at Impossible on Peter Street in July, but details have just been shared by Greater Manchester Police (GMP). They’ve released a CCTV image of a man they’d like to speak to regarding the incident, believing he may provide valuable information. Police are urging anyone who recognises him or anyone with information to get in touch. They’ve posted an appeal on social media, asking for tips to help with their GBH investigation. If you’ve got any information, you can contact them on 0161 856 4229 or reach out to Crimestoppers anonymously. The good news is that the victim is now on the mend.
