Quaffers was a beloved Stockport nightclub from 1978 to 1998, hosting stars like Shirley Bassey and Take That in its heyday. The venue, a transformed golf club, held 2,600 people and offered a hydraulic stage and hot beef barms, attracting a fashionable crowd. Owned by Dougie Flood, Quaffers was known for its strict dress code, which made headlines when patrons were turned away for various reasons, including hairstyles and attire like white socks. The club also featured adult entertainment, including a wet t-shirt contest. Despite its popularity, it closed in December 1998 and was demolished in 2004, leaving fond memories for many locals. Former patrons recall great nights filled with dancing, music, and a sense of safety. Ian Flood, Dougie's son, reminisced about the club's special role in the community, mentioning how delighted people still are when they share their memories of Quaffers.
