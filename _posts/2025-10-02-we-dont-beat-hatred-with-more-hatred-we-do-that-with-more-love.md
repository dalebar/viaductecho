The Bishop of Manchester, David Walker, is calling for unity in the wake of a shocking attack on a synagogue in north Manchester, where tragically two people lost their lives and several others were injured. He labelled the incident as an "attack on all of us," stressing the importance of community solidarity. Armed police responded quickly, shooting the suspect who had tried to harm members of the public. 

Bishop Walker expressed his sorrow for the local Jewish community and reflected on the need for love and understanding in these tense times, recalling the strength shown after the 2017 arena attack. He emphasised that, despite different beliefs, faith binds everyone together, and maintaining open dialogue between diverse faith groups is crucial. His hopeful message? Let’s respond with love and unity, showing that we won’t let such events divide us, but rather bring us closer together.
