The Magnet Pub in Heaton Norris has snagged the title of 'best mild pub' after ale enthusiasts voted during the annual Mild Magic Ale Trail. Organised by CAMRA, the trail saw over 5,500 visits as folks sampled mild ales at various pubs in Stockport and South Manchester. The Magnet impressed with its rotating selection of nine milds throughout the event. This year, 260 participants joined the fun, a 25% increase from last year, with some dedicated ale fans visiting all 101 pubs. The top ale voted by participants was Blackjack Dark Ruby. Outgoing organiser Darren Berry expressed gratitude to all involved and highlighted the trail's record participation as evidence of the demand for mild ales. With the recent recognition of Penzance Mild as Champion Beer of Britain, the future looks bright for mild brews. Mild Magic is set to return in Spring 2026, keeping the torch burning for this unique beer style.
