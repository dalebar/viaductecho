Refuse collectors play a vital role, emptying our bins weekly, but as Craig Denny highlighted on TikTok, the reality of working at a rubbish tip can be pretty grim. His recent video from Manchester shows heaps of accumulated waste, emphasising that these sites aren't as pleasant as we might think. He mentioned the terrible smell, calling it "absolutely stinks." The footage was filmed during his shift at Oldham's tip in Chadderton, and he's not the only binman sharing insights; another recently warned about an item that should never be recycled to avoid bin rejection. 

People reacted to Craig's post with mixed thoughts – some found the situation amusing while others acknowledged the challenges of the job. Waste centres usually operate daily, emptying bins not every day but when they're full, using specialist vehicles for efficiency. Rubbish is sorted for recycling, composting, or incineration, with an aim to reduce landfill use. Materials are meticulously sorted to ensure hazardous items are eliminated, highlighting the complex processes behind waste management. It's a tough job, but it keeps our streets clean!
