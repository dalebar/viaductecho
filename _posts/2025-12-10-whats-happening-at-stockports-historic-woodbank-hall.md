There's some worry about the future of Woodbank Hall in Stockport, a historic grade-II listed building that's been around since 1814 and is now on the heritage at-risk register. While Stockport council had promised to reveal concrete proposals by early 2025, the hall is in a 'very bad' condition and faces immediate risks of deterioration. The council has invested over £250,000 in repairs and security, but has faced criticism for previous delays. Cllr Micheala Meikle reassured that they're actively developing plans to secure funding for the hall's long-term use, aiming to turn it into a vibrant community asset, drawing inspiration from successful local projects. Historic England expressed its support, emphasising the building's value to the community and its need for protection. Residents can expect more updates as the proposals progress.
