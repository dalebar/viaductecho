Andy Burnham's been in the headlines a lot lately, especially after Andrew Gwynne resigned as the MP for Gorton and Denton. This resignation opened a potential path for Burnham to return to Parliament, stoking speculation he might challenge Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership. However, the Labour National Executive Committee quickly blocked his candidacy, leaving Burnham "disappointed." Despite the setback, many in Greater Manchester still support him as mayor, appreciating his hands-on approach and honesty. Voters expressed mixed feelings: while some see him as a future PM, others worry about his ambition overriding his mayoral duties. Supporters praise his communication skills and local roots, while critics mention prior unpopular moves, such as the clean air zone saga. Overall, while Burnham's appeal remains strong, opinions are increasingly divided, reflecting a complex political landscape in the region.
