The Ropeworks, a former mill building in Heaton Norris, is on the market with plans for 34 new homes, including four houses and 30 apartments. Originally approved for conversion in 2016, the plans fell through when a developer bought it in 2020 for a £6.5m luxury apartment project that never materialised. By 2025, the building showed signs of damage, prompting complaints from locals. Recent planning approval came in Summer 2024, and the site is now listed for sale by Landwood Group, with aims to maintain the original facade while repurposing the mill. Located on Stanbank Street near Manchester Road, it’s seen as a prime spot for residential development, offering easy access to local areas and Manchester City Centre. No asking price is provided; instead, interested buyers are invited to make offers.
