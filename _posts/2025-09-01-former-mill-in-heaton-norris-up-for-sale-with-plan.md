The Ropeworks, a former mill in Heaton Norris, is on the market with planning permission for 34 new homes, including four houses and 30 apartments. The 10,000 sq ft building, located on Stanbank Street, was last approved for conversion in 2016 but remained empty after a developer's plans fell through in 2020. When it was left vacant, damage to the building became a concern for nearby residents. However, renewed planning approval in Summer 2024 offers a fresh start for the site. The development aims to maintain the original facade while modernising the space. The areaâ€™s proximity to Manchester Road and local transport links makes it ideal for a residential project. Offers are being invited from potential buyers, with no price currently stated.
