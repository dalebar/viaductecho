Angeliki Stogia is the Labour Party candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election after former MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation. Stogia, a proud Mancunian and current councillor for Whalley Range, expressed her excitement about campaigning and uniting the community. She believes in promoting unity, fairness, and hope, contrasting it with divisive politics. The by-election is set for 26 February. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham's attempt to stand for the seat was blocked by Labour's national executive committee, which argued his win could lead to unnecessary elections for mayor and divert party resources. Burnham accepted the decision and pledged to support Labour in the by-election. His exclusion sparked discontent among around 50 Labour MPs. Stogia previously ran for Labour in Chester South and Eddisbury but lost to the Conservatives.
