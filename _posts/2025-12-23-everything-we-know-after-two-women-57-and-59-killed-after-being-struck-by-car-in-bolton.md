Emergency services in Bolton responded to a tragic collision on Monday morning, December 22, where a car hit two pedestrians at a busy junction. The victims, two women aged 57 and 59, sadly succumbed to their injuries at the scene. Police cordoned off the area while the Serious Collision Investigation Unit launched an inquiry, with Crime Scene Investigators present throughout the day. A 19-year-old male driver was arrested on suspicion of causing two deaths by dangerous driving and is being questioned. His car was found with significant damage, including a smashed windscreen. Greater Manchester Police are urging anyone with information, witnesses, or any CCTV or dashcam footage to reach out, quoting log 507 of 22/12/2025, either via the Serious Collisions Unit hotline or the GMP Live Chat service.
