The inquiry into the Southport murders revealed disturbing details about teen killer Axel Rudakubana, who called the Manchester Arena bombing a "good battle." At just 13, he was referred to the counter-terrorism Prevent programme thanks to his fascination with violence and school shootings. Despite this, he attacked an innocent child with a sharpened hockey stick, intending to target an alleged bully instead.

Rudakubana murdered three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport last year, leading to a review of his contact with various state agencies. Officers noted his autism but raised concerns about his violent interests and intent to kill. Evidence, like searching for gruesome images online, was overlooked, as relevant information wasn't shared with the officers handling his case.

PS Carmen Thompson, the Prevent officer, expressed regret over her assessment, stating that she didn't see the signs clearly enough. The ongoing inquiry aims to uncover missed opportunities that could have potentially prevented these tragic events. Rudakubana was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 52 years.
