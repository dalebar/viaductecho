A 75-year-old cancer patient in Wigan faced a shocking scenario when she was made to wait for 10 hours in her granddaughter's car in freezing temperatures after A&E declared it was 'too full' to admit her. Rushed in by her GP due to concerns of sepsis, she was told to wait outside to avoid the crowded waiting room. Her family, concerned for her health due to her immunocompromised state from chemotherapy, found the situation unacceptable. They highlighted that despite her vulnerabilities, she wasn't prioritised and was left to endure the cold until she was finally admitted. The hospital reported high pressure and capacity issues, with some patients waiting over 50 hours for a bed. The granddaughter voiced serious concerns about staffing shortages and treatment conditions, while hospital chiefs apologised for the delays, emphasizing their commitment to improving care. However, the unsettling experience has left the family questioning the reliability of local healthcare, stating they wouldn’t return to A&E even if her condition worsened.
