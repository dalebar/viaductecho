Exciting news for Manchester! The Manchester MediCinema Appeal has hit the halfway mark, raising £579,000 towards a lovely new cinema for kids in local hospitals. Spearheaded by Freddie Flintoff and the Manchester Foundation Trust Charity, the aim is to build a fully accessible 50-seat cinema at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and other sites. The cinema will offer a much-needed escape for patients, screening up to 260 films a year with the help of dedicated staff and volunteers. 

A recent visit to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool showcased the positive impact of an existing MediCinema, where kids like 11-year-old Nancy enjoy films as a distraction from their treatment. The vibrant cinema atmosphere makes it a fun and comforting space, even catering for kids in wheelchairs or hospital beds. Plus, it’s completely free for families, allowing them to enjoy quality time together away from the hospital room. As they aim for that £1.1 million goal, you can help bring this cinema experience to life by visiting mftcharity.org.uk.
