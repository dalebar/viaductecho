Although there were expectations she might stand, she’s focused on working to elect a Labour MP instead. In a recent interview, she shared her pride in receiving an OBE from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, highlighting her roots in Northern Ireland and how they shape her perspective on community and politics. She believes real change happens at the city and regional levels, emphasizing the importance of diversity and trust in communities.
