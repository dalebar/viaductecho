Aer Lingus UK workers at Manchester Airport are voting on strike action due to a pay dispute, which could lead to disruptions during the October half term. Nearly 130 employees at Terminal 2 are involved, and the ballot closes on October 13. Unite the Union accuses the airline's senior management of prioritising profits over workers' needs, as employees struggle to afford daily essentials despite the company reporting a â‚¬205 million profit for 2024. Workers recently rejected a 12% pay increase over two years, claiming it doesn't adequately address their low base salaries. There's also concern over a pay disparity between Manchester and Dublin staff, with the latter receiving better allowances. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, emphasised community support for the workers amid ongoing struggles. John O'Neill, Unite's regional officer, warned that if Aer Lingus doesn't improve their offer, strike action could become inevitable, also hinting that anyone with flights booked might face uncertainty. Aer Lingus has yet to respond to the claims.
