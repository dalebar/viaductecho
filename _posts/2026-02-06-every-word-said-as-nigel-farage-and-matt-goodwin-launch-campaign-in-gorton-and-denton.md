On February 5, Nigel Farage and Matt Goodwin opened the Reform UK party offices in Denton, gearing up for the Gorton and Denton by-election on February 26, following Labour's Andrew Gwynne stepping down. Goodwin, the party's candidate, emphasised that the focus should be on local concerns like Labour neglect, the cost of living, and anti-social behaviour, rather than the national media's narrative around diversity. He claimed many local voters from minority backgrounds share his concerns over immigration and community issues. Farage noted the presence of Muslim supporters within their party and dismissed questions about controversial views, highlighting that Reform is engaging with local priorities rather than national debates. Both urged that the campaign reflects the frustrations of locals who feel overlooked by Labour. They aimed to project Reform as the voice for communities feeling the effects of economic pressures and social issues, rather than the divisive discussions presented by other parties. Goodwin concluded that the campaign is about addressing real concerns on the ground, pushing for a stronger local community response.
