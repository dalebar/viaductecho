Martha Machiek, who fled South Sudan and now lives in a flat on Lancashire Hill, Manchester, shares her home with eight family members in very cramped conditions, facing significant challenges. They have just one toilet, and Martha's son with medical issues has the smallest bedroom, while she and her three-year-old share the couch. Issues like lack of heating, persistent mould, and ongoing maintenance concerns have compounded their stress, leading Martha to seek help from Stockport Homes, the social housing provider. While they've attempted some support, frustrations remain high due to slow responses and recurring problems. Other residents share similar woes, like broken lifts and safety concerns, despite a strong sense of community and the presence of supportive individuals like local councillor James Frizzell. Residents are frustrated that while investment is pouring into nearby areas, Lancashire Hill seems neglected. They long for improvements in living conditions and feeling valued, amidst ongoing structural challenges that need urgent addressing by both Stockport Homes and the local council.
