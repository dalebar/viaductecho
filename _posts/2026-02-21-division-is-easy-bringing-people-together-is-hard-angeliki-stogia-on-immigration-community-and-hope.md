On a frosty Wednesday morning at Cafe Plus in Denton, Angeliki Stogia shares her journey from Greece to Greater Manchester, where she's lived for 30 years. Over a Turkish coffee and a latte, she reflects on local changes, her proud achievements as an Executive Member for Environment, Planning & Transport, and her love for the city. Stogia, who arrived as a student in 1995, is passionate about community and connecting with constituents' lived experiences. Despite the challenges, she believes Manchester is a welcoming city that celebrates diversity and collective strength.

In light of the upcoming by-election, she discusses pressing issues like immigration, the cost of living, and healthcare, while expressing frustration with political opponents who focus on division. Stogia urges the need for time to address problems faced by constituents, especially after years of austerity. She emphasises her priorities if elected, including tackling antisocial behaviour, expanding free school breakfast clubs, and improving local healthcare. With a deep commitment to ensuring no one feels excluded, Stogia’s heartfelt connection to Manchester shines through as she navigates the political landscape.
