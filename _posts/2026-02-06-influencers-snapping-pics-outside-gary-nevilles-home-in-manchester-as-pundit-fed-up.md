Gary Neville is reportedly ‘fed up’ with influencers taking selfies outside his home on St John Street, a charming Georgian street in Manchester city centre. This area, the last surviving Georgian terraced street, is popular for its aesthetic, attracting former Love Island stars and other social media personalities. Neville owns several properties there, including a four-bedroom terrace listed for rent at £20,000 a month. Despite its beauty, he finds the constant photo-taking disruptive, as influencers often use his doorstep for their snaps without realising he lives there. The street, known for its historical significance and preserved charm, has seen little change since its 1700s construction, aside from some minor updates in the 1960s. It’s a hotspot for enchanting backdrops, but Neville’s frustration grows as he has to repeatedly clear people off his doorstep.
