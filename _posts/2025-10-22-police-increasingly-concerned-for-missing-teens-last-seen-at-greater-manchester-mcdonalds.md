Willow is a white girl, slim, about 5 feet tall, with long blonde hair, last spotted in a pink jacket, black leggings, and Nike trainers. Rudolf is of medium build, has black hair, and was wearing black bottoms, a black jumper, a bandana, and a grey bag. If you have any leads, please call 101 or 999 in an emergency.
