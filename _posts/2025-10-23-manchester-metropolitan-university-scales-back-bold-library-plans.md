Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) has unveiled scaled-back designs for a new library that will replace the All Saints building. They're aiming for a future-focused space at the heart of the campus, featuring a purpose-built, digitally enabled facility for study, research, and collaboration. The latest plans show a nine-storey structure, down from the earlier approved 13-storey design due to rising construction costs. The revised library will boast light-filled interiors, flexible study areas, and advanced digital infrastructure, alongside green spaces and improved pedestrian routes around the site. Andrew Fallon, MMUâ€™s chief property officer, described it as a significant milestone for the campus, reflecting a commitment to education and community. A public consultation is set to run from October 23 to November 21, 2025, where feedback can be submitted through the university's website or via email.
