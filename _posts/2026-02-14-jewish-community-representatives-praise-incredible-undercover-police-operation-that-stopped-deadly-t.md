Representatives from Greater Manchester’s Jewish community are grateful to the police for thwarting a major terrorist plot that could have resulted in one of the deadliest attacks on British soil. Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein received life sentences for planning to target Jewish events and areas, including a pro-Israel march in Manchester, with firearms and ammunition. The operation to stop them involved undercover surveillance, which was praised for saving lives. Community leaders expressed deep concern over the rising antisemitism and highlighted the threat posed to the local Jewish community, especially following a recent attack at Heaton Park. Marc Levy, CEO of the Jewish Representative Council, emphasised the importance of addressing the root causes of radicalisation rather than simply increasing security measures. He reinforced their commitment to resilience and coexistence within Manchester, noting that the community has contributed significantly to the region for generations. Two others connected to the plot also received sentences, and the community continues to cope with the challenges posed by such extremist threats while striving to maintain their vibrant presence in the area.
