On Shrove Tuesday, Rochdale in Greater Manchester fondly recalls the day in 1994 when they set a Guinness World Record for the largest pancake, cooked in a massive 50ft pan. Weighing three tonnes, it was crafted with milk tankers and flipped by cranes, breaking the previous record by 8ft. The pancake was then sliced into 15,000 pieces for charity. Alan Gill and Graham King from the Co-operative Union organised this landmark event, and the impressive pan was made of 25 tonnes of steel, crafted by Manchester Metropolitan University engineers. 

Local resident Cath reminisced about the atmosphere, recalling how her brother said, "history was being made." She described the excitement as lorries delivered the batter and music filled the air. More than thirty years later, no one has beaten Rochdale’s record, solidifying its place in pancake history as they celebrate yet another Shrove Tuesday as champions.
