Connor Holland, now 30, reflects on his troubled past marked by a botched gangland shooting that left an innocent man seriously injured. Jailed for 15 years for his role in the crime, Connor felt his life was 'over' at just 22. While serving time, he found purpose in fitness and religion, transforming his identity and helping him come to terms with his past. He expresses deep regret for his actions and wishes to apologise to the victim.

Since his release in April 2024, adjusting to life in London has been tough but rewarding. Connor has qualified as an abseil window cleaner and works as a strength and conditioning coach. Looking ahead, he plans to run from London to his hometown of Salford for Christmas, a distance of about 95km per day, to demonstrate that change is possible. He aims to inspire others by showing that second chances exist and life can be reshaped, despite a dark past.
