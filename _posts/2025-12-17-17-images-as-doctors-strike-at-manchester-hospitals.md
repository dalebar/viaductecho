Resident doctors in Greater Manchester kicked off a five-day strike today over pay, starting at 7am with pickets outside the Manchester Royal Infirmary. The walkout is expected to affect several hospitals as the NHS grapples with a spike in flu cases. Around 30 to 40 doctors braved the rain to join the picket line, including Dr Vivek Trivedi, who expressed the need for better pay and job conditions to support future consultants and GPs. Dr Trivedi reassured that patient care would remain a priority, with senior doctors stepping in for their striking junior colleagues. The aim is to push for a deal that addresses these issues not just for the present, but for the years ahead.
