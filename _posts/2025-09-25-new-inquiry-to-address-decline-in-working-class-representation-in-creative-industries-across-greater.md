Nazir Afzal OBE is leading an inquiry in Manchester to enhance working-class representation in the region's creative industries. This initiative addresses a noticeable decline in this representation, particularly in a city hailed as the 'birthplace of the working class'. With a rich history of influential artists like the Gallagher brothers and Morrissey, the aim is to ensure that the next generation of talent isn't left behind. Afzal is collaborating with Avis Gilmore and social research consultancy RISE to engage with local artists and identify barriers to participation. A symposium is scheduled for January 26 next year to explore potential solutions. The project has support from various partners, including the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the Co-op, both keen to unlock hidden talent in the area. There's a strong push to revive the infrastructure that once nurtured working-class artists, raising the question of whether we could see iconic figures like Liam Gallagher emerge today. Everyone's invited to share their thoughts through focus groups and an online survey.
