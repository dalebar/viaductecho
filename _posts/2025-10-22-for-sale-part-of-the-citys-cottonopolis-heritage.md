Victoria Mill, a stunning 19th-century industrial gem in Miles Platting, Manchester, was built in two phases between 1869 and 1873. Once central to the city’s Cottonopolis reputation, it contributed to Manchester's industrial legacy and smoke-filled skies. Now, parts of the mill, which houses NHS healthcare facilities, are up for sale. The ground floor east wing is available for offers around £1.35 million and currently includes NHS offices and a medical centre, with the potential for future residential development. 

Originally designed by George Woodhouse and comprising striking architectural features typical of its era, the mill has a rich history. It operated until 1960 and was listed as a Grade II* building in 1988. Recently refurbished while maintaining its historical character, Victoria Mill represents a unique investment opportunity in one of Manchester's key regeneration areas.
