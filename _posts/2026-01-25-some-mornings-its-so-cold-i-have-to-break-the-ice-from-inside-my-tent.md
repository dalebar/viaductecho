Jordan, a part-time dog-walker in his 20s, has been homeless for eight years, currently sleeping in a tent in Angel Meadow, Manchester. He's recently faced harsh conditions, waking up to frozen ice inside his tent. He feels dehumanised and frustrated, highlighting that despite working, he struggles to find safe accommodations, turning down a placement in Wythenshawe due to safety concerns. After the deaths of two homeless men over Christmas, he reached out to the Manchester Evening News to voice his plight. While Jordan claims he applied for emergency housing during the cold snap, the council has no record of his referral, and outreach teams didn't locate him. Supported housing options often feel unsuitable due to previous negative experiences. Amanda Thompson from the charity Two Brews echoes his sentiments, noting that many find supported accommodation inadequate due to funding issues. Manchester council continues efforts to assist rough sleepers but faces challenges as many refuse offers of help for various complex reasons.
