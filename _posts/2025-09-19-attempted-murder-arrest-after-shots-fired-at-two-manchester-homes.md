A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following two shootings in Newton Heath. The first incident occurred on Ainthorpe Walk, where an innocent couple and their young son were nearly injured when a shot was fired through their window. The father suffered minor injuries from broken glass during the incident. Shortly after, another shot was fired at a home on Ballantine Street, though no injuries were reported there. Greater Manchester Police arrested a 34-year-old man, charging him with two counts of attempted murder, firearm possession, and assault. Police are encouraging anyone with information or footage related to the incidents to come forward. Theyâ€™re also increasing patrols in the area for community reassurance.
