The Rapid Relief Team, a charity from the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, has donated 20 food boxes to Poynton Community Larder, providing enough food for around 240 meals to help locals struggling with the cost of living. The Larder offers reduced-cost food and hygiene products to residents in need. Volunteers from the team are thrilled to support this essential community hub, especially during the challenging festive season. This isn’t their first contribution in the area; they’ve previously served meals at events in East Cheshire and Manchester. Amos Wilkinson, the Local Team Leader, highlighted the importance of such support and how it can positively impact families in Poynton. With food insecurity affecting one in six UK households, this donation plays a vital role in assisting those in need.
