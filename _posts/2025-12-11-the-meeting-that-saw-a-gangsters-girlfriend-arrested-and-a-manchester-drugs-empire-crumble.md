Lisa Prescott, a mother from north Manchester, was arrested for aiding her gangster partner, James Close, in running a £1.8 million drug ring while he was incarcerated. Police conducted a six-month operation, culminating in raids that uncovered substantial amounts of drugs, cash, and ammunition in Crumpsall and surrounding areas. Prescott was linked to Close, who received a hefty 36-year sentence for drug and gun crimes, and was seen meeting with other gang members. In court, it was revealed that she facilitated drug operations for Close from prison, acting under his direction. When arrested, Prescott claimed she was pressured into her role and had no knowledge of the large quantities of drugs seized. Defences for Prescott and other arrested associates highlighted personal hardships and vulnerabilities, pleading for leniency. Sentencing for Prescott and eight others involved in the ring is expected soon, with various legal representatives arguing for community-based penalties rather than immediate custody.
