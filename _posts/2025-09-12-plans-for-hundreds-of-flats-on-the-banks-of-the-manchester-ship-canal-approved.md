Plans have been approved for a new development along the Manchester Ship Canal, featuring 382 build-to-rent apartments and 412 student studio flats. The Trafford planning committee has green-lit the demolition of an old office building near Trafford Wharf Road for the project, which aims to create a high-density, car-free residential zone. The development will consist of two tall tower blocks of 16-24 storeys, alongside a six to eight-storey block for students and additional commercial spaces.

The project includes a Â£2.4 million contribution for affordable housing, 15 accessible car parking spots, and improvements for education and outdoor sports facilities. Committee members acknowledged the plan's potential but raised concerns about families living in high-rise apartments near student housing. Despite mixed opinions, the overall sentiment was positive, with emphasis on the development's sustainability and green initiatives, including 100% electric buildings. Local representatives believe this project is a pivotal step for the area, signalling the start of more developments at Trafford Wharf.
