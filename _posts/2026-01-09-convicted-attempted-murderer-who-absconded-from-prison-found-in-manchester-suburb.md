Kieran Cameron, a convicted murderer on the run from HMP Thorn Cross, has been nabbed in Hulme, Manchester. He went missing on January 6 while serving a 23-year sentence for attempted murder in Dorset back in 2016. Cameron, 43, was involved in a brutal attack on a 20-year-old man, leaving him with ten stab wounds, and during his trial, it came to light that he and his accomplice, Michael O'Rourke, were mixed up in serious organised crime. Cheshire Police confirmed his arrest and expressed gratitude for community support in the search.
