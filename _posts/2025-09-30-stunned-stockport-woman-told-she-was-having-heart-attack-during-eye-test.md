Norma Booth from Stockport had a routine optician visit thinking she might need new glasses, but ended up being told she was having a heart attack. Feeling dizzy, she opted for a blood pressure check, a new addition to eye tests in an NHS trial. The results showed dangerously high blood pressure, prompting an immediate call to her GP and a trip to the hospital where doctors confirmed she was indeed having a heart attack. Norma described the experience as a “miracle” and urged others to accept blood pressure tests when offered. The initiative, currently being trialled in four areas including Greater Manchester, has already completed 4,000 tests and saved an estimated 44 lives in just eight months, highlighting its potential to identify high blood pressure and lower cardiovascular risks.
