Midwife Amie Barnes, beloved mother-of-three, was found dead in her boyfriend's bed after taking painkillers to manage chronic back pain, an inquest revealed. The 37-year-old had shared a night of wine and takeaway with her partner in Thornton-Cleveleys before he left for work and found her unresponsive later. Initial concerns about foul play were dismissed, and a post-mortem indicated her death was due to the combined sedative effects of painkillers, not alcohol. The coroner concluded it was a misadventure, noting that rather than being intentional, her death resulted from unintended consequences of pain relief efforts. Amie was a dedicated midwife who worked in Blackpool and Preston, leaving a deep impact on her community. Friends organised for Blackpool Tower to be lit pink in her memory, reflecting on her generous spirit. Amie's funeral took place at Carleton Crematorium, where family and friends gathered to celebrate her life. She leaves behind three children aged 19, 12, and 7, who will carry on her legacy.
