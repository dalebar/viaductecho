Police in Bury used a stinger to halt a 'dangerous' motorbike being ridden on pavements. Two riders, who weren’t wearing helmets and had no registration plate, attempted to flee after racially abusing an officer trying to stop them. Following reports of reckless driving near pedestrians, the bike was successfully brought to a stop using the stinger, causing the tyres to deflate. The riders abandoned the bike and were quickly arrested nearby. They've been charged with various offences, including dangerous driving and racially aggravated public order, and are currently on bail as investigations continue. GMP Bury emphasised their commitment to tackling antisocial behaviour in the town centre.
