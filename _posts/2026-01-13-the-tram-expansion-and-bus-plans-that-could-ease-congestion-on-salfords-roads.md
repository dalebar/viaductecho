Salford’s got some exciting plans in the works to tackle road congestion with a Metrolink expansion and improved bus services. The council and TfGM are focusing on enhancing the number 50 bus route, linking East Didsbury to MediaCityUK, which promises quicker and more reliable journeys—potentially slicing 4.3 minutes off bus times during peak hours. With thousands of new homes expected due to regeneration efforts, these transport upgrades aim to meet rising public demand.

Key improvements include a new bus gate on South Langworthy Road, better bus stops, and revamped junctions to cut delays. While some traffic might get diverted, the aim is to ease congestion overall and improve air quality in the area. The public is invited to engage with the plans, with a consultation kicking off soon, allowing residents to voice their opinions. Recent additions, like the new number 30 bus route connecting the Trafford Centre to Manchester, complement these developments. Salford's really gearing up to make travel smoother for everyone!
