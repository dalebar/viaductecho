Manchester's city centre is buzzing with tens of thousands celebrating the New Year, as revellers gather in pubs, clubs, and on the streets for the countdown to midnight. This year marks a special occasion with two civic squares hosting events—St Peter's Square and Albert Square. A free firework display is set to launch from the roof of Manchester's Central Library. Early birds have already staked their spots near St Peter's Square for the best view, while Albert Square is a hit with its vibrant food and drink stalls. The atmosphere is lively with families and friends enjoying treats like toasted marshmallows and soaking in the festive spirit. Photos capture the excitement, from crowds and stalls to the Manchester Ferris Wheel, highlighting a festive night in the heart of the city.
