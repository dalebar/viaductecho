Tameside Council has ramped up efforts to combat crime, reporting over 162 arrests this year, thanks to enhanced CCTV measures—more than triple last year's figures. New mobile cameras have been deployed in hotspots for fly-tipping, successfully identifying offenders in several cases. The council's extensive CCTV network, with over 300 cameras, monitors key areas and collaborates closely with the Community Safety Team to relay vital information to the police, tackling issues like drug activity and organised crime. There’s also been success in finding vulnerable individuals, with 53 located so far in 2025. Tameside's executive members praised the CCTV team's effectiveness, especially the mobile cameras' role in not just identifying but deterring fly-tipping. They’re dedicated to staying ahead of culprits and adapting their surveillance tactics as needed. Overall, it's a solid win for community safety in Tameside!
