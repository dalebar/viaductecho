Over a dozen Greater Manchester walks have been relaunched by local ramblers, now called the 'Manchester Green Trail'. These 15 trails connect various green spaces like parks, rivers, and canals, creating a continuous loop of 67.2 miles around the city. Initially set up in 2012, the trails have been revamped with updates and new maps. The trails start at Chapel Street park in Levenshulme and stretch to Heaton Park before heading south through the city centre to Wythenshawe. The Manchester and Salford Ramblers, backed by the Manchester council, aim to encourage locals to enjoy the health benefits of walking and exploring their urban surroundings. It’s all about finding nature in the city and promoting wellbeing through activities like leisurely strolls, jogging, or family outings. You can download trail PDFs from the Ramblers’ website to get started on discovering Manchester’s hidden gems!
