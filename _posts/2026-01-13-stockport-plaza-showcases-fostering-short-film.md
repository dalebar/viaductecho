Stockport Plaza is showcasing a poignant short film titled "The Run," highlighting the transformative impact of foster care. This film, produced in collaboration with Stockport Council and several local authorities, will be shown at the iconic art-deco cinema, preceding classics like "When Harry Met Sally" and "All About Eve." The story follows Tom, an 11-year-old navigating a challenging home life, illustrating the duality of running from danger and finding strength in sport. Councillor Wendy Meikle emphasised the urgent need for foster carers, expressing gratitude to the Plaza for promoting this vital cause. The film aims to inspire more people to consider fostering. For more info on becoming a foster carer, check their website or call 0300 303 0321. Upcoming screenings can also be found on the Plaza’s site.
