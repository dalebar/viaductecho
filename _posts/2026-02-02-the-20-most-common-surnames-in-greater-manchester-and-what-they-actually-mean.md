In Greater Manchester, surnames like Lowry, Pankhurst, and Gallagher are well-known but don’t crack the top 20 most common. Instead, you've got the likes of Smith, Jones, and Taylor leading the pack, with around 112,121 unique surnames in the area! The meaning of these names reveals a lot about history. For example, Smith relates to metalwork, originating from Old English 'smītan,' meaning 'to strike'. Jones originates from Welsh, meaning 'son of John', while Taylor stems from the French 'tailleur', meaning 'cutter of cloth'. Other popular names like Williams and Johnson are patronymic, meaning they denote 'son of'. Then there's Khan, an important Muslim surname taken from Mongolian meaning 'military ruler'. It’s fascinating how these names tell stories of ancestry, occupation, and geography. Many others like Roberts, Jackson, and Walker all carry similar historical significance, underscoring the rich tapestry of cultural heritage embedded in surnames across Greater Manchester and beyond!
