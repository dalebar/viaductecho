A massive carp has been spotted in a Greater Manchester canal, weighing over 30lbs and measuring more than two feet long. Locals initially mistook it for a floating log while it glided between moored boats on the Bridgewater Canal. Sarah Mather was the lucky witness who shared her surprise at seeing this uncommon “underwater unit.” The Bridgewater Canal, rich in history, was originally built for transporting coal and opened back in 1761. It is home to a variety of fish, but this colossal carp could easily surpass the previous record of 25lbs caught just a few months ago. Exciting times for local fishing enthusiasts!
