A plane crash in Littleborough, Rochdale, on February 3 claimed the lives of two men on board a Cirrus SR20 aircraft. The plane had taken off from Birmingham before it lost signal south of the M62 after about 40 minutes of flight. Following the crash, a yellow parachute from the aircraft’s built-in emergency system was found on a nearby pylon. It’s believed that this parachute, part of Cirrus's safety features, was deployed as the aircraft descended. Emergency services responded quickly, but sadly, both individuals were pronounced dead at the scene. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has launched an investigation into the crash, with police urging witnesses to come forward. There were no reported injuries on the ground, and authorities are working to gather evidence and identify the victims. Chief Superintendent Danny Inglis expressed condolences to the families affected and stressed the need to fully understand the circumstances around this tragic event.
