Emergency services rushed to Wigan Road in Bolton after an 11-year-old boy was hit by a car at around 3:50 pm on January 21. The lad sustained minor injuries, and fortunately, no arrests were made. This incident is part of a troubling trend on Wigan Road, which has already seen a tragic crash earlier in January, claiming the lives of a taxi driver and three young men. Five others were injured in that accident, including a couple who expressed disbelief over their survival. Just six days later, officers were called to another crash on the same stretch of road.
