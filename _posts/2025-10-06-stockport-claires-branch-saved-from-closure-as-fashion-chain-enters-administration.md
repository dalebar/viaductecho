Stockport's Claire's shop in the Merseyway is safe from closure after entering administration in August 2025. Modella Capital has stepped in to buy most of Claire's stores, saving 156, including the one in Stockport, and approximately 1,000 jobs. Unfortunately, 145 stores won't be part of this deal and will shut down. Claire's is known for its jewellery, fashion accessories, and ear-piercing services.
