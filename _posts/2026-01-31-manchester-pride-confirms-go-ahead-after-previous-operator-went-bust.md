Manchester Pride is set to continue this year under new management after the previous organisers, Manchester Pride Events LTD, collapsed, leaving debts of over £1m. A new not-for-profit community interest company, Manchester Village Pride, will take charge of the four-day event. They plan to restore key features like the parade and annual vigil, while also introducing a Pride Fringe with arts and culture events. The community can expect a more inclusive approach, with a Community Advisory Board and input from local LGBTQ+ organisations.

Notably, the event will be the first in the UK to sign a union agreement with Equity, ensuring fair pay for performers after the previous organisers' failures. Manchester City Council has emphasised the importance of the event for the city’s identity and community spirit. This fresh start is being seen as a positive change, focusing on responsibly supporting local charities and ensuring the sustainability of Manchester Pride for years to come.
