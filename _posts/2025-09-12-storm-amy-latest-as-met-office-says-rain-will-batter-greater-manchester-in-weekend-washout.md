Greater Manchester is gearing up for a rainy weekend, with heavy downpours and strong winds expected. Following a sudden thunderstorm on Thursday leading to flash flooding, the Met Office has issued warnings for more unsettled weather ahead. Friday starts with a dry spell and some sun before showers kick in around midday, with heavier rain overnight. Saturday will have a mix of sun and showers, with the heaviest rain forecast for late afternoon. Sundayâ€™s weather looks particularly grim, with early morning sunshine giving way to heavy rain from midday. Wind warnings are in place from Sunday night into Monday, with gusts reaching up to 48mph. Monday continues with heavy rain in the morning, while temperatures will hover between 16-18C during the day and drop to 8-12C at night. There's a lingering possibility that this weather pattern could develop into a named storm, dubbed Storm Amy, but that's still up in the air. Stay dry, Manchester!
