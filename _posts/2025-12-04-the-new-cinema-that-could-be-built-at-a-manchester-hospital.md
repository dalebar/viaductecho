A fundraising campaign has kicked off to create a cinema for hospitals across Greater Manchester, spearheaded by TV presenter Freddie Flintoff. The aim is to raise £1.1 million to build a fully accessible 50-seat cinema at hospitals like Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary. Flintoff, joined by Wayne and Colleen Rooney, highlighted the joy this cinema could bring to long-term patients who often miss out on simple outings. The cinema, set in an old lecture theatre, will have comfy seating, wheelchair space, and features like subtitles and sensory-friendly screenings. Expected to showcase around 260 films annually, it’ll also allow personal screenings for sensitive cases. The project won’t cost the NHS extra and every donation, even just £2, contributes significantly. Kathy Cowell of the trust expressed gratitude, noting the cinema would provide a much-needed sense of normality for patients. Donations can be made by texting CINEMA to 70580 or through the Manchester Foundation Trust Charity’s website.
