Scott Whitney, a wheelchair user from Manchester, has been struggling to find suitable housing for nearly three years. Currently living in a cramped, non-accessible property in Ancoats, he faces daily challenges with basic tasks like showering due to narrow doorways and inadequate facilities. After being placed in various unsuitable homes by Manchester City Council, he was temporarily housed in a hotel before being offered private accommodation with financial support from the council. While they claim to be helping him find accessible options, many proposed properties have turned out to be inadequate.

The situation for wheelchair users in the region is concerning, with thousands on waiting lists for accessible homes and inadequate development plans from local councils. Campaign group Habinteg highlights the dire need for more wheelchair-accessible properties, as only one is planned for every 2,006 people in the north west. Some councils, like Stockport and Trafford, are beginning to implement requirements for accessible homes in new developments, but many others have not yet taken action.
