John Cooper Clarke reflects on his first paid gig in 1974 at Bernard Manning's Embassy Club, where he faced an indifferent audience not keen on poetry. Despite a rough start, Clarke soon rose to fame in the punk scene, performing alongside iconic bands and drawing inspiration from the gritty streets of Salford. After battling hardship in the 80s, including struggles with heroin, he experienced a resurgence in popularity with his poem "I Wanna Be Yours," covered by the Arctic Monkeys, leading to newfound fame and streaming success. Now 76, Clarke enjoys life in Colchester with his wife, still embracing his unique style. He's set for a major tour, including a homecoming show at Manchester Apollo in 2026, alongside the release of a new poetry collection. Clarke attributes his enduring popularity to his dedication and perseverance in the industry, declaring that performing is the only skill he knows.
