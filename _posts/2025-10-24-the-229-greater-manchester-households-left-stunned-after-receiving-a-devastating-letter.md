Billy Jackson, a 72-year-old army veteran, faces eviction from Rochdale’s College Bank tower blocks, where he has lived for 40 years. The decision affects 229 households due to safety concerns from a recent survey, prompting Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) to plan for the buildings to be empty by Christmas. Billy expressed his devastation and fear of being forced to relocate, particularly worried about moving far from his home. The tower blocks, built in the 1960s, have been a strong community hub, but Billy worries about the impact on elderly residents. 

RBH stated that all tenants will be supported in the moving process, but many residents and local campaigners, like Mark Slater, feel the urgency of the situation has caused panic. There are concerns that this could lead to eventual demolition, despite RBH claiming no such decision has been made yet. Residents are advocating for a refurbishment plan they created, which could be more cost-effective than RBH’s previous estimates for redevelopment. Meanwhile, local officials and MP Paul Waugh have called for a respectful process to ensure residents' wellbeing.
