Christine Crolla is understandably frustrated about plans for 1,550 new homes, shops, a healthcare facility, and a school set to change the rural landscape between Bowlee and Simister. Residents are worried that their quaint villages, nestled next to one of the busiest motorway junctions in the north west, will be swallowed by development. Many locals, including pensioners Brian Ward and Brian Carney, fear for their idyllic views and community spirit, expressing feelings of helplessness as councils move forward with the project. While some residents accept the need for housing due to the neighbouring Atom Valley development, concerns abound about increased traffic and the area's character. Toni Jordan, reflecting on the situation, feels the influx could disrupt community harmony, despite recognising the housing crisis.
