Temperatures in Greater Manchester are set to drop as the Met Office warns of freezing conditions and a yellow warning for snow and ice on Friday, January 2. Areas like Trafford and Stockport will be affected, with sleet and snow expected to move southeast, potentially bringing 1-5 cm in some spots, especially on higher ground. Expect icy patches as the snow clears, leading to possible travel disruptions on roads and rail. While no warnings will be in effect over the weekend, it’ll stay chilly with temperatures not much above freezing, although it’ll remain bright and sunny with no rain forecast.
