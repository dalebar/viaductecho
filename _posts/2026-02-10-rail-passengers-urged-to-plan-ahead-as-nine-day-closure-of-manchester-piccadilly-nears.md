Manchester Piccadilly is set for major disruptions from February 14 to February 22 due to a £7.9 million upgrade of six lines. Platforms 1 to 12 will be closed for nine days, meaning no trains from the south and east will run into the station during half term. Avanti West Coast and Cross Country services will terminate at Stockport. A limited service will run to Manchester Airport from Crewe. Network Rail’s Rebecca Rathore emphasised that the upgrades are crucial for future reliability. Passengers are encouraged to check National Rail Enquiries for updates and plan ahead. To ease travel, valid rail tickets will be accepted on selected Bee Network buses and trams, with extra bus services added. Simon Elliott from TfGM highlighted the importance of this investment for a resilient rail system. Travellers should expect busy times and allow extra time for their journeys.
