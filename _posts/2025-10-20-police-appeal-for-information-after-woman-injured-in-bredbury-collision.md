Police are asking for help after a woman was injured in a collision in Bredbury on 6 October. She was getting out of her parked car on Stockport Road West when another vehicle struck it. Luckily, though she suffered serious injuries, they werenâ€™t life-threatening. The driver of the black Vauxhall hatchback involved has not been located, and police are looking for information from witnesses. The car is thought to be a 2020 model or later, with damage to the front nearside wing and a missing mirror. Anyone with CCTV, doorbell, or dashcam footage around that time is encouraged to reach out. You can contact police at 101 or via their Live Chat, quoting log 2248 of 06/10/25, or you can reach out anonymously to Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111.
