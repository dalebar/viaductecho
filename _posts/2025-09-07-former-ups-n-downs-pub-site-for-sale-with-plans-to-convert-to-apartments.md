The old Ups N Downs pub site on Wellington Road South is up for sale for £700,000, with plans to convert it into 14 luxury apartments and a commercial space for a shop or café. The proposal includes five one-bed and nine two-bed apartments. Despite receiving planning permission in 2024, no renovation has started yet, leaving the building, which has been around for about 200 years, described as a "derelict eyesore." Originally known as the Wellington Bridge Inn, it was a popular pub in the '70s before transforming into a vibrant club atmosphere.
