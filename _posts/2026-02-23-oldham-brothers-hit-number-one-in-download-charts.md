Two brothers from Oldham, Danny and Callum Connor, known as Two Connors, have topped the UK Singles Downloads chart with their song "Familiar Faces," outshining big names like Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars. After three years in the local music scene, their catchy tribute to Oldham’s legends and characters has taken off, marking a massive leap from small gigs to mainstream success. 

Initially writing another song, the duo recorded “Familiar Faces” during a studio session, and it exploded in popularity after a live online performance. Reflecting on their journey, they recalled starting with just 64 Facebook followers and now boasting over 100,000. Their family’s support, especially their grandma’s surprised reaction to hearing their song on Capital FM, has been heartwarming. 

Callum prioritises music full-time, while Danny emphasises staying grounded amidst the fame. Their aspirations include aiming for a number one single in the future, staying motivated despite challenges, and encouraging others to pursue their dreams.
