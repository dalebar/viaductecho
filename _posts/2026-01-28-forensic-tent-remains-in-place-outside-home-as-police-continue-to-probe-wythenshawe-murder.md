A murder investigation is ongoing in Wythenshawe after a woman in her 30s was found unresponsive at her home on Lulworth Gardens, where a forensic tent and police cordon are still in place. Emergency services were alerted around 8:30 am Tuesday, following reports of a disturbance. Sadly, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. Locals described the street as quiet, with one eyewitness recalling the woman banging on a neighbour's door for help and screaming before the tragedy unfolded. Police have reassured the community that there's no wider risk, and specialist officers are actively investigating while supporting the victim's family. Members of the public with information are encouraged to contact Greater Manchester Police.
