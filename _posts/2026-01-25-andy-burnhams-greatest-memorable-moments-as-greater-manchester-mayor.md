Andy Burnham, the first mayor of Greater Manchester, may be wrapping up his term to re-enter Parliament, forcing him to resign due to conflicting laws. His nearly nine years as mayor have transformed the region, particularly after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, where he encouraged unity and resilience. Burnham has focused on improving emergency services, transport, and housing. Notably, he pushed for the Bee Network, bringing buses under public control, a significant milestone for the city. Under his leadership, Manchester's skyline has evolved, supported by innovative funding like the Housing Investment Loans Fund. Recently, he unveiled plans to enhance economic growth through the £1 billion Good Growth Fund and initiatives aimed at reindustrialisation. Burnham has also championed better rail services, securing investments in new rail lines and pushing for improved infrastructure, including an underground station at Piccadilly. Overall, his tenure has seen immense change that has elevated Greater Manchester’s profile and infrastructure, making it a notable period in the city's history.
