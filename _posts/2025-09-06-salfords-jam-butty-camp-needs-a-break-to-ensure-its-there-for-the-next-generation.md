Salford's beloved "Jam Butty" holiday camp in Prestatyn has been a summer escape for local kids since 1926. After facing closure in 2014, it was saved following a public campaign, and recently, an old lady's generous bequest secured its future. Now, an urgent appeal is on to raise £100,000 for replacing an old dormitory with new family-friendly lodges. Currently, the camp runs independently without council funding but maintains a healthy bank balance thanks to donations and fundraising. Nick Abbot, who was instrumental in the camp’s rescue, emphasised the need for local businesses to support this vital initiative. With 38% of Salford kids never having a holiday, the camp aims to provide free getaways for those who can’t afford it. A key fundraiser, a Halloween Ball at The Lowry Hotel, is set for October 31st, featuring special guests and opportunities for table sponsorships. This is a chance for the community to not just enjoy a good night out but to make a real difference in kids' lives. Nick calls on the business community to rally again to ensure generations of children can create seaside memories for years to come.
