A dispersal order has been issued in Leigh town centre by Greater Manchester Police to tackle anti-social behaviour. Starting from 9am on October 25 and lasting for eight hours, police can ask individuals causing or likely to cause trouble to leave the area. While no specific incidents were mentioned, the move aims to enhance safety and deter misconduct. Officers will be more visible during this time, and residents are encouraged to approach them with any concerns.
