A new political party named Together for Bury has been formed, featuring four former Conservative councillors—Russell Bernstein, Jo Lancaster, Luis McBriar, and Dene Vernon—who recently left due to internal disagreements within the party. The Electoral Commission has officially recognised them, making Together for Bury the fourth largest group on Bury Council. They’re up against Labour, which holds the majority with 32 seats, followed by the official opposition, Radcliffe First, with eight, the Conservatives with five, one Independent, and one Reform UK member. Coun Bernstein, the party leader, has stated that Together for Bury aims to represent all communities in the borough and will announce their candidates for the 2026 Local Elections in January. They also took the chance to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and shared their enthusiasm for the upcoming year.
