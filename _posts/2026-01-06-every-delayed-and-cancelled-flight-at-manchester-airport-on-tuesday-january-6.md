The chilly weather in Greater Manchester and the UK shows no signs of easing on Tuesday. Despite the cold snap, Manchester Airport is running smoothly, with most flights on schedule, though a few KLM flights to Amsterdam have been cancelled due to severe weather at Schiphol. The specific cancellations include flights at 5.50am, 9.05am, and 1.40pm. The airport is well-prepared for winter conditions, utilising over 30 snow-clearing vehicles and special forecasting systems to minimise disruptions. Runways are treated with anti-freeze rather than standard road grit to protect aircraft. If you’re flying soon, keep an eye on your flight status as some are delayed, including a few to Munich, Mumbai, London, Frankfurt, Abu Dhabi, and Islamabad.
