From January 12-15, several motorways in Greater Manchester will be closed overnight, as outlined in a National Highways report. The M56, M60, M61, M62, M67, and A627M will see closures starting between 9pm and 11pm, lifting by 5am or 6am the next day. Most closures should only affect night owls or early commuters. Thankfully, there are no major events happening at key arenas, and both Manchester City and United won't play midweek, meaning a relatively quiet week on the roads. Things will pick up again at the weekend with City playing at The Etihad. If you're planning a late drive, be sure to check the specific sections listed, especially around the M60 and M62. Stay safe out there!
