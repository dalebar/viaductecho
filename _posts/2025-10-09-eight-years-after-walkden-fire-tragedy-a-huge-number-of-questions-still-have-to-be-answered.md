It’s been nearly eight years since the tragic arson that killed a mother and her four kids in Walkden. Despite the horrific events on December 11, 2017, a full inquest into their deaths won’t start for another year. Michelle Pearson survived the attack but later succumbed to her injuries in 2019. Her children, Demi, Brandon, Lacie, and Lia, were all lost that night when petrol bombs were thrown at their home. Zak Bolland and David Worrall got life sentences for their murders, while Bolland's girlfriend Courtney Brierley received a 21-year sentence for manslaughter. An ongoing serious case review is examining how authorities interacted with the Pearson family before the fire. Delays have pushed back the inquest, with the latest hearing held on October 9, where representatives discussed necessary disclosures and witness statements. The official inquest is now set for October 2026, with more pre-inquest reviews scheduled for spring next year to ensure everyone is kept informed and prepared.
