Greater Manchester schools have excelled, topping the North West league tables in the Sunday Times Parent Power Guide for 2025. Altrincham Grammar School for Girls has snagged the title of the best state secondary school in the region and is also named State Secondary School of the Year for Academic Excellence 2026. Over in the independent sector, Withington Girls' School clinched the top spot, outperforming notable contenders like The Manchester Grammar School. While no Manchester school was honoured as Independent Secondary School of the Year, Cheadle Hulme High School and Didsbury High School made the cut. This guide serves as the most reliable source for parents, helping them compare school performances amid a challenging educational landscape marked by budget cuts and rising mental health concerns. Editor Helen Davies highlighted the dedication of teachers who strive to enrich their students' educational journeys.
