The Mayor of Greater Manchester has announced funding for nearly 20 community-led projects aimed at creating mood-boosting green spaces across the region, supported by a £500,000 fund. This sixth round of the Green Spaces Fund sees 19 new initiatives selected, including transformations of neglected areas into welcoming gardens and communal spaces, like a food park in Stockport, a new street park in Wigan, and a community garden at a Rochdale hospital. Collaborative efforts like the ‘Garden of Hope’ in Manchester are designed to bring together local residents and refugees to learn gardening skills. Supported by Together Money and Autotrader, Mayor Andy Burnham expressed pride in these projects, emphasising the importance of connecting communities with nature for mental wellbeing and cohesion. Since its inception in 2022, the fund has granted £3.5 million to improve green spaces. Projects like a wildflower meadow and various community gardens reflect the vibrant community spirit in Greater Manchester, aimed at enhancing local environments and fostering healthier lifestyles.
