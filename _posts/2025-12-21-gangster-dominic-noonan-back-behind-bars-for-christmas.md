Dominic Noonan, a notorious figure in Manchester's gangland, has been recalled to prison after breaching his release terms. He protested against his 65 licence conditions, including a ban from Chorlton, preventing him from visiting his parents' grave, especially around Christmas. Noonan, who served time for serious sex offences, had been released early as part of a government scheme to reduce prison overcrowding, despite having spent much of his adult life behind bars. Before his recall, he expressed frustration over job opportunities he was told to turn down and restrictions on using the internet. His criminal past includes convictions for historical sexual offences, arson, and other violent crimes. Notably, he once attracted media attention by climbing a big wheel in protest. At 61, he has lived a life heavily marked by crime, and officials stated they will enforce strict rules for offenders who break their conditions.
