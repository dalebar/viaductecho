Stockport Air Raid Shelters is marking 30 years since reopening to the public after decades of being sealed off. Built just before WWII in 1939, these extensive underground tunnels can house over 6,500 people and are filled with original fixtures, including a sick bay and electric lighting. The shelters were initially opened for tours in 1988 after local history enthusiasts expressed interest. By 1996, they were fully restored and welcomed visitors as a proper attraction. Over the years, the site has become an important educational resource for local schools, offering children hands-on experiences related to wartime life. Roger, a tour guide for over a decade, shares insights and fun stories about the tours, which mix history with entertainment. The shelters, now nearly 90 years old, are among the oldest intact shelters in the UK, alongside Stockport's Hat Museum. Open Tuesday to Sunday, they host various heritage and arts events throughout the year.
