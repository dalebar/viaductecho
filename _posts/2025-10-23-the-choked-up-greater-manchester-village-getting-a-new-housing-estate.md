Plans for a 57-home development in Standish, Greater Manchester, have been approved after an appeal by Persimmon Homes, despite previous refusals due to local concerns about overdevelopment and traffic congestion. The inspector, Chris Baxter, stated the development complies with existing planning policies, noting that local housing targets have already been exceeded. The decision has sparked backlash from the local pressure group Standish Voice and other residents, who argue the village's infrastructure, including NHS services, is already overstretched. They've expressed disappointment that local objections, including those from the council and community members, were disregarded. The approval raises concerns over further traffic issues and the impact on community resources in a village that has seen significant housing growth recently.
