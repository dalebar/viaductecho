Planning permission has been granted for the second phase of development in Salford’s new Adelphi Village, which will see 185 apartments built on the former Farmer Norton car park on Cleminson Street. This phase follows an initial plan for 42 three-bedroom townhouses and is part of the larger £2.5bn Crescent Salford masterplan, aiming for over 800 homes in total. The new apartments will be in two buildings, up to six storeys tall, featuring a courtyard garden, cycle storage, and plenty of greenery. The project's design is inspired by the area’s industrial heritage. Accessible homes and mixed-use spaces will be included, all within a ten-minute stroll from Salford Central train station. Steve Thomas from ECF expressed excitement about starting this community-focused development, highlighting the need for quality housing. The overall masterplan envisions more than 3,000 homes and new business spaces, with a standout feature being Salford Rise, a 220m elevated walkway for pedestrians and cyclists, set to be completed by summer 2026.
