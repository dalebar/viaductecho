Angeliki Stogia, Labour’s candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election, passionately declared her anger during a rally, aimed squarely at her opponents, particularly Reform UK and the Green Party. With key Labour figures like Lucy Powell and Ed Miliband backing her, there’s a palpable sense of urgency as Labour seeks to maintain its historically safe seat amidst rising challenges. Stogia emphasised her commitment to progressive politics, criticising both Reform and the Greens for their lack of genuine solutions to community issues. She passionately rallied support, arguing that only Labour has the unity and strength to effect real change. While Stogia's fiery speech seemed to galvanise the party faithful, the real test will come on polling day, with many voters in the area still to be convinced.
