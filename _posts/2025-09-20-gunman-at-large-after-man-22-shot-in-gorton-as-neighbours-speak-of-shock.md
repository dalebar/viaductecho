Detectives are on the hunt for a gunman after a 22-year-old man was shot in the foot in Gorton during the early hours. Thankfully, he only sustained a graze and no serious injuries. The incident occurred around 12:15am on Saturday, prompting armed officers to respond and find a bullet lodged in the victim's shoe. A large police cordon was set up around the scene, where forensics began gathering evidence, and Tactical Aid Unit officers conducted thorough searches despite the wet weather. Neighbours expressed shock, noting that the area generally feels safe, and police have been canvassing for CCTV footage. This shooting marks the fourth reported incident in Greater Manchester recently, but it's not linked to two other shootings in Newton Heath. As of now, no arrests have been made, and investigations are ongoing.
