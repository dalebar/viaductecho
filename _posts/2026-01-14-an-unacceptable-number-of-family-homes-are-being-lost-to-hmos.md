Councillor Matt Wynne has raised concerns about the rise of house shares in Stockport, claiming it’s leading to the loss of family homes. He accuses Stockport Council of not acting on a 2022 vote that aimed to implement new regulations for converting residential homes into houses of multiple occupation (HMOs). This measure, known as an article four direction, would require planning permission for such conversions, allowing for community input. Wynne highlighted that the council’s inaction is changing the character of local streets and negatively impacting residents. 

Councillor Jake Austin, from the council, pointed out that although the original motion was passed in 2022, advancements were hindered due to increased housing targets after the Labour Party's election win. He stated that progress is being made, with a report on article four options coming up for discussion soon. The council plans to address this issue further in an upcoming meeting.
