Two men have been recalled to prison for affray connected to a recent shooting in Manchester's Gay Village. The incident occurred on January 24, when a man in his 20s was found shot in the leg on Richmond Street; thankfully, he's expected to recover. Greater Manchester Police are investigating and seeking public help to piece together what happened leading up to the shooting. Alongside the two men recalled, three others aged 24 were released on bail, while one remains in custody for questioning. Detective Chief Inspector Chris Woodburn thanked the local community for their support during this tough time and urged anyone with information, including CCTV or dashcam footage, to come forward. Tips can be shared via phone or through the GMP website.
