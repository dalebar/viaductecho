Firefighters returned to a Rochdale area less than 24 hours after dealing with a fire above the Greengate Pub and Kitchen. They were called to John Street for a car fire around 6.30pm on Wednesday, December 3, dispatching three fire engines from Rochdale and Littleborough stations. The crew, equipped with breathing apparatus, took about 90 minutes to put out the blaze. The previous night, they had tackled a fire in the upper floor of the pub while it hosted a bingo night. No injuries were reported, but both incidents highlight the busy nature of fire crews in the area lately.
