A group of councillors from Heald Green, Stockport, has reported facing 'appalling' treatment from some residents during discussions on housing plans, particularly regarding potential green belt developments. Following Labour's 2024 election victory, new housebuilding targets were established, leading to a public consultation on the local plan that sparked heated reactions. The Heald Green Ratepayers expressed frustration over harassment directed at Councillors Anna Charles-Jones and Carole McCann, calling it 'totally appalling'. Cllr Charles-Jones, who has faced misogynistic comments and threats online, highlighted that while they encounter aggression from a vocal minority, they receive different feedback when engaging with residents face-to-face. Other councillors echoed these concerns, noting an increase in hostility towards elected officials, which could discourage future political participation. The councillors emphasized the need for constructive dialogue to improve community understanding of the planning process, while condemning the unacceptable behaviour that is becoming too common.
