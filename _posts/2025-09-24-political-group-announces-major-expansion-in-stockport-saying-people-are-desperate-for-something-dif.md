The Stockport Community Group (SCG), led by Cllr Matt Wynne, is expanding its efforts in the borough to challenge Labour and the Lib Dems for council influence. They’re focusing on winning seats in areas like Davenport, Cale Green, and Reddish during the May 2026 local elections. The SCG, which has recently grown from the Edgeley Community Association, aims to ensure local voices drive decision-making rather than national politics. They’re calling for candidates and volunteers to support their community-based model, claiming residents deserve better than the current political landscape. 

In response, both the Lib Dems and Labour have accused the SCG of being merely a 'Labour lite' alternative. Lib Dem leader Cllr Mark Roberts highlighted the existing champions already serving the community, while Labour leader Cllr Christine Carrigan acknowledged SCG’s successes but argued Stockport doesn’t need another political party. As the May 2026 elections approach, the actions of the SCG could significantly impact council dynamics.
