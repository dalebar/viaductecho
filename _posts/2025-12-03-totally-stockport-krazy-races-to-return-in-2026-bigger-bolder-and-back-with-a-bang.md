Totally Stockport is buzzing to announce the return of Totally Stockport Krazy Races on Sunday, 9th August 2026, after a two-year hiatus. This soapbox derby promises to be even grander than before, attracting families and thrill-seekers alike. The last race drew over 15,000 spectators, showcasing 30 imaginative soapbox teams. 

Since its inception, Krazy Races has toured the UK, raising over £200,000 for local charities, with nearly £20,000 benefiting Stockport directly. In 2026, teams will race down a 350m course filled with obstacles, competing for trophies like Fastest Kart and Best Design. 

Local businesses, schools, and community groups are encouraged to join in the fun and build their own soapbox karts. Sponsorship opportunities are also available for businesses to gain visibility. The event will feature a lively village with food stalls and family entertainment, guaranteeing a fantastic day out for all. 

Krazy Races has become a key highlight in Stockport, boosting the local economy and highlighting the town’s vibrant spirit. Applications to enter a team or become a sponsor are live on the Krazy Races website.
