A trespass incident in Castlefield disrupted Manchester's railways this morning, causing significant delays. National Rail reported the issue at 11.36am, affecting trains between Deansgate and Oxford Road stations. Lines were initially closed, with trains then running at reduced speeds, leading to delays of up to 40 minutes. TransPennine Express warned that all its services could be impacted, with Northern, Transport for Wales, and East Midlands Railway also affected. Passengers were advised to use trams, free buses, or walk between stations, and ticket restrictions were lifted. While all lines have reopened, delays are still ongoing, with National Rail expecting disruption until at least 2.30pm.
