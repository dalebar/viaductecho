The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, is committed to ensuring the safety of Jewish and Muslim communities following a rise in hate crimes. During a visit to the Heaton Park Synagogue in Manchester, she announced £73.4 million in funding for mosques and synagogues to bolster security measures, including CCTV, fencing, and on-site security staff. This comes after a tragic terrorist attack at the synagogue in October 2025, highlighting the need for enhanced protection for places of worship.

Reeves emphasised the importance of community safety, stating that both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are issues that need addressing together, not pitting one community against another. The funding will extend through 2026/27, with £21.5 million specifically earmarked for next year. Various funding schemes will also support non-Jewish and Muslim faiths, ensuring that all religious communities feel secure. The announcement includes additional funding for protective measures at Christian, Hindu, Sikh, and other faith sites, with the aim of providing a safe environment for worship across the board.
