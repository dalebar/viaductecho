A former US filmmaker, DePree, is in a High Court dispute with an English council over control of Hopwood Castle, a stately home he’s been trying to save for seven years. Inspired by his grandfather's tales, he only learned about the castle while researching his family history in 2013 and moved to the UK to restore it. He struck a deal with the council in 2017 to buy the hall for £1, contingent on securing planning permission for development. The council insists any sale hinges on DePree presenting a solid business plan to ensure the castle's long-term future. DePree feels he’s fulfilled his part of the agreement and is heavily invested in the project, even selling his Hollywood Hills home to fund it.
