After a tragic knife attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in north Manchester during Yom Kippur, there was a massive surge in antisemitic incidents. Reports showed 40 cases on the day of the attack and another 40 the day after, marking the two highest daily totals for antisemitism in 2025. The Community Security Trust indicated that Jewish people faced direct taunts and abusive messages, with some expressing joy over the attack. The incident led to a total of 3,700 antisemitic incidents throughout the UK in 2025, a slight rise from the previous year.

Tragically, this attack resulted in the deaths of two men and was noted as the first antisemitic terror attack in the UK to cause fatalities since the charity began tracking incidents. Further statistics revealed a rise in property damage and online antisemitism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and CST Chief Executive Mark Gardner emphasised the urgent need for increased protection for the Jewish community amid deepening societal tensions.
