Joyce Todd, a 79-year-old woman from Oldham, played a pivotal role in shifting Labour's stance on immigration, but she’s not convinced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s recent comments. During a 2016 visit, she shared her experiences and concerns about immigration in her community, feeling pressured to prove she wasn't racist before expressing her views. In a recent Labour Conference speech, Starmer reflected on this encounter, highlighting how it influenced his perspective on the party's relationship with working-class voters. Despite the changes announced by Labour to tighten immigration rules, including a digital ID card and stricter requirements for migrants, Mrs Todd has declared she won't vote Labour again, expressing distrust in Starmer's promises. “I don’t believe a word he says,” she stated, sticking to her long-standing Labour roots but feeling let down. A Labour spokesperson reiterated the government's commitment to reducing net migration and cracking down on illegal activity.
