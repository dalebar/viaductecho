Today, more than 200 flights are delayed at Manchester Airport due to heavy rain and a yellow weather warning from the Met Office, lasting until late tonight. Delays have impacted flights throughout the day, including those scheduled to depart as late as 8pm, with airlines like British Airways, Ryanair, and easyJet affected. Passengers are encouraged to check their flight status with airlines, as delays can arise from various factors, including weather, staffing, and Air Traffic Control. Additionally, one runway is closed for repairs on the taxiway, complicating the situation further. Although the repair should be quick, the ongoing poor visibility due to the weather is causing delays to stretch out longer than expected.
