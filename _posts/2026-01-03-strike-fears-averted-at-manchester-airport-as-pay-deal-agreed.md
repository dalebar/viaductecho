Strike action at Manchester Airport has been avoided after staff accepted a new pay deal, according to the airport. Last November, union Unite had declared a trade dispute following a consultative ballot where members rejected an initial pay offer, leading to potential industrial action. The roles affected included bus drivers, security staff, and engineers, among others within Manchester Airports Group (MAG). Concerns had arisen as some employees at Stansted received a more favourable pay proposal. However, the airport has now confirmed a recommended three-year pay deal was accepted by union members after a subsequent ballot. A spokesperson expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating it brings certainty for colleagues, although specific details of the deal haven't been disclosed. The Manchester Evening News has sought comments from Unite but has yet to receive a reply.
