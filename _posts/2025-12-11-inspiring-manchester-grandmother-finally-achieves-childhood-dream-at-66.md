Jean Taylor, a 66-year-old from Worsley, has finally achieved her dream of becoming a nurse after graduating from the University of Lancashire. Supported by her family, she persevered after falling short of her goal in 2020 due to personal challenges. Jean re-enrolled and completed her studies, earning her degree as she prepares for a competitive nursing job interview. With 14 years of experience in palliative care for Marie Curie and a strong personal connection to mental health issues, she’s determined to contribute to the field, especially in mental health nursing. Her son Sam is incredibly proud of her journey, emphasising her resilience and the idea that age shouldn’t hold anyone back from chasing their dreams. Here’s hoping she nails that interview!
