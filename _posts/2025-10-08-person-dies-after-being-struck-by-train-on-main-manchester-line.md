Tragically, a person has died after being struck by a train near Gatley railway station in Stockport this afternoon. Emergency services pronounced them dead at the scene, and this incident is not being considered suspicious. The details about the individual are currently unavailable.

Following the incident, thereâ€™s major disruption on the train lines between Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport, with services from Northern, TransPennine Express, and Transport for Wales either cancelled or delayed. The blockage is expected to last until at least 3.30pm. People are advised to use the Metrolink or the free Bee Network bus for their journeys.
