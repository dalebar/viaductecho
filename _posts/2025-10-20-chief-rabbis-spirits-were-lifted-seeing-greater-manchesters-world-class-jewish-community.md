The Chief Rabbi praised Greater Manchester's Jewish community as "world class" during his meeting with King Charles, who visited the site of a recent synagogue attack. Crowds gathered at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation to witness the King speak with victims and emergency responders following the October 2 incident, which resulted in two deaths. Rabbi Mirvis highlighted the community's resilience and dedication to Jewish values amidst the trauma. He described the Kingâ€™s visit as special, offering condolences and support during a tough time. Despite rising anti-Semitism fears, Rabbi Mirvis believes the UK remains a "good society" keen on addressing hate issues collaboratively. He acknowledged the solidarity and support received from various groups nationwide, while stressing that the challenge of anti-Semitism must be tackled collectively, not just as a Jewish issue.
