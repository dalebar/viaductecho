Plans have been revealed for a new waterfront neighbourhood on Pomona Island in Greater Manchester, featuring 2,600 homes alongside a hotel, a five-acre park, and social spaces for coffee shops and eateries. Developer Peel Waters has lodged an outline planning application with Trafford Council, aiming to transform the remaining 25 acres between the Bridgewater Canal and the Manchester Ship Canal. The site has a rich history, from botanical gardens to docklands, but has been neglected for years. So far, nearly 600 homes have been built, with another 500 on the way. The new plans include public green spaces, footpaths, and cycleways to connect the area with the city centre. The development intends to cater for all income groups, ensuring housing options for everyone. Feedback from community consultations is being used to help shape the project, and over 1,000 new homes could be ready within five years. Leigh Thomas, the Development Director, expressed excitement about opening up the island to the public and the opportunity to create a vibrant neighbourhood filled with amenities for all.
