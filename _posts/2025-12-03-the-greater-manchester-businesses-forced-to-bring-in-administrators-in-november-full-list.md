In November, nine businesses in Greater Manchester went into administration, highlighting a troubling trend in the region's economic health. Insolvency-related activity surged by 26% in October, with 442 instances reported, the highest monthly total since April 2025. The north west now has the second-highest insolvency figures in the UK, behind Greater London. Also notable, overdue invoices increased slightly and the number of start-ups dipped. R3's Fran Henshaw expressed concerns over the economic uncertainty affecting business confidence, urging leaders to be vigilant about financial distress and seek timely advice. In November alone, the following companies went into administration: Huddle SPV 17 Limited, Law Absolute Limited, Persona Media Ltd, and others. The administration process generally lasts a year, during which an administrator evaluates the company's financial situation and seeks potential solutions, like restructuring or new investments. The aim is to either return control to directors or move to liquidation to repay creditors.
