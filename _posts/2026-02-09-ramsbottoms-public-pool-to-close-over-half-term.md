Ramsbottom Pool and Fitness Centre will close for up to four weeks starting February 23 for urgent repairs to window lintels. While the pool will be off-limits, Bury Leisure members can book swims at Castle Leisure Centre instead. The council aims to assist families with kids in swimming lessons by providing alternative schedules at Castle. Councillor Tamoor Tariq expressed regret for the inconvenience, emphasising the necessity of the repairs for health and safety. The pool is expected to reopen by March 23 at the latest, potentially sooner. Meanwhile, a new £40m leisure centre is under construction in Radcliffe, featuring a 6-lane adult pool, a learner pool, a gym with over 100 stations, and other facilities. This 'Radcliffe hub' is set to open later this year.
