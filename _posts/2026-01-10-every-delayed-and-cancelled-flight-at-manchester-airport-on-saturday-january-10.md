Storm Goretti has really shaken things up this week, bringing strong winds, snow, and sleet across the UK. Transport has taken a hit, with roads closed and rail services suspended on Friday. Despite the chaos, Manchester Airport has mostly kept it together, running flights on schedule, even with a brief two-hour closure of one runway to fix a small pothole. Flights were redirected to the other runway, which was fortunate, given January is typically quieter. However, the weather has caused delays and cancellations for over 3,200 flights since January 2, with Amsterdam flights particularly affected. Schiphol Airport is working hard to assist stranded travellers. If you’re flying soon, keep an eye on your flight status as things may change with the ongoing winter weather. Flights currently delayed or cancelled at Manchester include services to Amsterdam, New York, Paris, and more. Stay safe and check your updates!
