A tragic crash in Bolton on January 11 claimed the lives of three teenagers—Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, Farhan Patel, and Mohammed Danyaal—and a taxi driver, Masrob Ali. The collision occurred around 12.45am on Wigan Road when a red Seat Leon, driven by Mukhtar, collided head-on with Ali's Citroen C4 Picasso taxi. Emergency services responded swiftly, but sadly, the four individuals died. Funerals for the victims attracted hundreds of mourners, showing the community's support. Mukhtar's brother publicly apologised for his brother's actions, stating he’d warned him about speeding, claiming Mukhtar was driving around 90mph at the time of the accident. Five passengers from both vehicles were injured, with one woman sustaining life-threatening injuries. Greater Manchester Police are still investigating the incident and have urged anyone with information or footage to come forward, while also cautioning against sharing potentially incriminating videos on social media.
