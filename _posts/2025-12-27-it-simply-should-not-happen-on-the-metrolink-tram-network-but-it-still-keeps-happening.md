Lifts at several Metrolink stops in Greater Manchester have been out of service lately, creating significant challenges for disabled passengers. Recently, a disabled man was left stranded at night due to malfunctioning lifts, prompting public criticism of Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM). Multiple stations, including Heaton Park and Failsworth, reported ongoing issues, requiring some users to seek alternative routes or assistance. TfGM has promised to improve response times for repairs and plans to implement remote monitoring of certain lifts to enhance service reliability. Advocacy groups stress that faulty lifts are a barrier to accessibility, highlighting the need for an inclusive public transport system. Although some lifts have been repaired since the issues were highlighted, there are still concerns about ongoing faults and delays in lift replacements. TfGM acknowledges the importance of making the Bee Network accessible for everyone and is committed to addressing these issues, with plans to replace several lifts in the coming years.
