Summer's fading fast in Greater Manchester as we gear up for an unsettled week. Saturday's looking dry with sunshine, though it'll turn cloudy in the arvo, and there's a 40% chance of rain after midday. Expect highs of 22C, with a pleasant breeze. The evening stays mainly dry but still cloudy, cooling down to 16C. Sunday swings back with more clouds and heavy showers, plus a small chance of thunder, peaking at 21C. This unsettled weather promises to stick around next week, bringing strong gusts and heavy downpours, though we'll still get the odd sunny spell.
