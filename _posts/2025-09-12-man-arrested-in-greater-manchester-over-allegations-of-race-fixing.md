A 42-year-old man was arrested in Hawkshaw, Bury, as part of a joint investigation by Greater Manchester Police and the Gambling Commission into alleged horse race fixing. The arrest, which took place at 6am on September 12, comes after reports of suspicious betting patterns earlier this year. The man is accused of offences under section 42 of the Gambling Act, relating to cheating at gambling. If found guilty, he could face up to two years in prison and a fine. The British Horseracing Authority has chosen not to comment on the investigation.
