Manchester Airport is launching a direct route to Islamabad, Pakistan, with Pakistan International Airlines starting flights later this month, making it the only northern airport offering this connection. Currently, about 362,000 people from the region travel to Islamabad yearly, often having to connect through the Middle East or fly from London. The service will run on Tuesdays and Saturdays from 25 October, with hopes to increase frequency. Airport Managing Director Chris Woodroofe expressed excitement about connecting the North to the world and serving community demand. The flights will depart from the newly opened, £1.3 billion Terminal 2, which has won accolades for its design. A spokesperson for Pakistan International Airlines highlighted the advantage of direct, hassle-free travel, cutting down travel time to just eight hours.
