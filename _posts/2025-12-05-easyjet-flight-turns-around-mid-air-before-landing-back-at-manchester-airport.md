Passengers on an easyJet flight heading to Krakow were flown back to Manchester due to thick fog in Poland, which affected multiple airlines on December 4. The flight EZY2263, originally set to land at 8.19pm local time, had to divert back after reaching Germany and returned at 7.19pm. easyJet confirmed that adverse weather caused the diversion, and as conditions showed no signs of improving, the flight couldn't operate later. They offered rebooking options, refunds, and accommodations for affected passengers, highlighting that customer safety is their top priority. Other flights faced similar issues, with Ryanair diverting to a different airport and multiple cancellations from Krakow. The local airport issued a notice about the situation, thanking travelers for their understanding amid the disruptions.
