Greater Manchester Police have arrested a 26-year-old man suspected of rape, as well as harassment, coercive control, and theft. He was wanted in connection with a Salford rape from September 2025 and a domestic incident in Oldham last May. The police, using live facial recognition (LFR) technology since last October, scanned over 40,000 faces, leading to four arrests on Wednesday and Friday. Additionally, a 59-year-old man was arrested for breaching prison recall and sex offender requirements, while a 55-year-old and a 48-year-old man were taken in on theft charges.
