A man was arrested for pretending to be a food delivery driver to drop off drugs. After fleeing from police, he was found hiding behind a bin and was already wanted for previous offences. The 33-year-old faces multiple charges, including robbery and possession of class A drugs. Meanwhile, in Gorton, officers stopped a car and found a man with cannabis, burner phones, and cash, leading to his arrest for possession with intent to supply class B drugs. Another man, 30, was apprehended for handling stolen property and driving while disqualified after a stolen scooter was found. Superintendent Rick Thompson highlighted the successes of Operation Venture, which has made significant arrests and reduced crime in the area. Those with information can reach out to GMP via their website or call Crimestoppers anonymously.
