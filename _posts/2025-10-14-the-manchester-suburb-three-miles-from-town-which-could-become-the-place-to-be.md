Gorton, just three miles from Manchester city centre, is set for a £60m redevelopment that aims to transform the area with hundreds of new flats and a revamped market. The council plans to kick off this project on October 15, bringing at least 400 new homes and a revitalised high street. Recent improvements include a new public square and the Gorton Hub, which houses various community services. Gorton is one of four areas in Manchester receiving a £20m boost from the government's Pride in Places programme, allowing residents to have a say in how the funds are spent. The town hall will also invest £1.1m into Gorton Market Hall next year, creating a new food and drink cluster and enhancing connectivity to the new square. The development includes a six-storey block of 70 affordable apartments and 35 supported flats for young people leaving care. A long-term deal with housing association Latimer will enable further development in line with the council’s vision. Details will be discussed in a council meeting on October 15, which can be watched online.
