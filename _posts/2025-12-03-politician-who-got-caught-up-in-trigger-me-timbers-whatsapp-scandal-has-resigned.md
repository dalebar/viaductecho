Claire Reid, a Tameside councillor caught up in the 'Trigger Me Timbers' WhatsApp scandal, has resigned, stating her choice is about starting a 'new chapter' in life, not the political fallout from earlier this year. Reid was part of a WhatsApp group with offensive messages aimed at constituents and colleagues, which led to a Labour Party investigation and her six-month suspension. Although she returned to the party, fellow councillors from Denton South faced expulsion. Looking back at her nearly two-decade tenure, Reid highlights her pride in achievements, like halting the development of The Tame Valley. Her departure opens a vacancy in the Denton South ward, but a by-election hasn’t been announced; the seat will be up for re-election in May 2026.
