Wednesday in Stockport will be mostly cloudy with a good chance of rain, especially in the morning. Temperatures will range from a mild 7°C up to 11°C in the afternoon, but with high humidity at 81% and winds reaching 19 mph, it’ll feel a bit chillier. Rain is a certainty, so commuters should prepare for wet conditions and allow extra time for travel. Roads could be slippery, so drive carefully and if you’re using public transport, don’t forget your umbrella or waterproofs. Dressing in layers and wearing a warm, insulated jacket will help keep you comfy throughout the day. Stay dry and warm, and make the most of your Wednesday!
