Stockport's weather for Thursday looks quite pleasant! Expect a mix of clouds and sunshine with mild temps flirting between 7°C in the morning and a high of 13°C later on. Humidity's a bit high at 83%, but no rain's expected, so it should stay dry. With light winds at just 4 mph, it’s a calm day for any outdoor plans. Commuting should be smooth sailing, but do give yourself a bit of extra time in the morning when it’s cooler. Layer up to stay comfy throughout the day, and enjoy the lovely autumn vibes!
