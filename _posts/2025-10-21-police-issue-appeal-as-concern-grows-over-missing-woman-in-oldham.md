Concern is rising for Susette, a woman who went missing in Oldham. Last seen on Oak Street at about 8.56pm on October 20, she is thought to be on foot within the area. Police described her as a white female, around 5ft 4in tall, slim, with greyish hair. She was last spotted in a blue anorak, blue jeans, a beige jumper with black stripes, and black trainers with white trim. Officers are increasingly worried for her wellbeing and are asking anyone with information or who might see her to contact Greater Manchester Police at 101, quoting log 3670 of 20/10/2025.
