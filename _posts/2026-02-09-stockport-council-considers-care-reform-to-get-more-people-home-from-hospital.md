Stockport Council is looking to shake up patient care with its new 'Home First' strategy, aiming to ease hospital pressure by sending more patients home after treatment instead of to care units. This plan is in response to over 60,500 residents aged 65 and above, and the rising costs of care services. The current Integrated Care Model categorises patients based on their support needs after discharge, with several pathways directing their post-hospital care. The council's ambitious plans include establishing a new health facility, the St. Thomas' Centre for Living Well, due to open in early 2027, which will offer short-term recovery support. They also aim to boost access to GPs and pharmacies at weekends and enhance home equipment provision. Sarah Dillon, director of social care, expressed enthusiasm for a proactive approach to care, aimed at supporting independence and reducing reliance on hospital beds. An implementation plan is set to be developed soon, with more details to follow.
