Greater Manchester is buzzing with some exciting developments! A billion-pound health campus is in the works near Royal Bolton Hospital, promising new housing, student digs, green spaces, and improved transport links. Meanwhile, the quirky ‘Pigeon Triangle’ park is set to rise close to Piccadilly Station, part of a larger plan for nearly 900 new homes, designed by award-winning Tom Massey. 

Over in Heywood, a £20m revitalisation of the town centre is awaiting government approval, aiming to spruce up the area with improved shops and more youth activities. Droylsden's shopping centre could soon host a new swimming pool, while plans for over 400 homes around Stockport are also on the table. Lastly, Trafford football club wants to build a new clubhouse, adding to the local sports scene. All these projects are set to enhance the community and drive economic growth across the region!
