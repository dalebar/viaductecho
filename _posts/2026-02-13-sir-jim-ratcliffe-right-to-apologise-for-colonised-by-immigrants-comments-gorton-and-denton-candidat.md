Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Manchester United co-owner, apologised after his comments about Britain being 'colonised by immigrants' sparked significant backlash. During an interview, he suggested that the UK has too many immigrants and too many people on benefits. His remarks drew criticism from various political figures, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham, who emphasised the need for inclusivity in Manchester. At a hustings event for Gorton and Denton by-election candidates, all participants expressed support for Ratcliffe's apology. Labour’s Angeliki Stogia said his comments contradicted Manchester’s values, while Liberal Democrat Jackie Pearcey highlighted the UK’s long history of immigration and integration. Conservative Charlotte Cadden noted that while freedom of speech is important, Ratcliffe's comments warranted an apology. Green candidate Hannah Spencer shared similar sentiments, stating public figures should ensure their statements are accurate. Reform UK's Matt Goodwin maintained that while he disagreed with Ratcliffe's terminology, people should feel free to express their views. The hustings took place ahead of the upcoming election with 11 candidates vying for votes.
