Plans are underway to develop a new estate of 200 homes at the 'Secret Lake' on the Manchester-Stockport boundary, aiming to tackle issues of fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour. Northerngroup Developments has submitted planning reports, highlighting the area's unsuitable conditions and the need for more housing, as Stockport has missed its targets since 2018. The site will feature a mix of family houses and apartments, with proposed improvements to public spaces, including aquatic planting and new fishing piers. The development emphasises access to public transport and cycling routes, with 233 parking spaces planned. While the project aims to revitalise the area, there are concerns about potential impacts on local wildlife, particularly during breeding seasons for certain birds and bats. The decision on the application is expected by April 10.
