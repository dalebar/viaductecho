Manchester Airport is shifting more airlines to Terminal 2 as part of its ongoing £1.3 billion transformation. Aer Lingus, Luxair, Finnair, and British Airways have already moved, and now easyJet will join them on November 19, followed by Icelandair on October 28 and Air Transat on November 2. These airlines offer transatlantic flights to North America, with Icelandair providing connections to Canada and the US, while Air Transat focuses on Canada. The airport assures that each airline will inform passengers about the changes. Once the transformation is done, Terminal 2 will handle 70% of flights, featuring new shops like Lego, Joe and The Juice, and Pandora. As Terminal 1 closes for expansions, Terminal 2 will showcase a modern look that mirrors its recent extensions.
