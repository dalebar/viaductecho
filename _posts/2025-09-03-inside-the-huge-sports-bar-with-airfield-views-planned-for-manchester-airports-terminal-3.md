Manchester Airport has unveiled exciting plans for a revamped Terminal 3, showing off impressive computer-generated images of the new space. One of the highlights will be a sports bar named Sporting Chance, featuring up to 469 seats and amazing views of the airfield, complete with giant foosball figurines and numerous TV screens. The renovation, resulting from the closure of Terminal 1, will enhance the terminal's capacity by 40%, introducing new security measures, shops, and eateries, including an Italian restaurant called Terracotta. Work is already in progress, with some areas set to open early next year.

This comes as the airport finishes a £1.3bn project to transform Terminal 2, which has recently doubled in size and will now host the majority of its passenger traffic. With new check-in desks, a modern security hall, and trendy shops set to launch, the airport aims to elevate the travel experience. Managing director Chris Woodroofe emphasised their commitment to improving passenger experiences as they shift focus to Terminal 3's exciting upgrades.
