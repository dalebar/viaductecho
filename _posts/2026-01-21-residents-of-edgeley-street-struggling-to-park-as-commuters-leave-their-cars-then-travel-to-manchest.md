Residents on Gradwell Street in Edgeley, Stockport, are facing parking woes as commuters use street space for free parking while they catch trains to Manchester. With the nearby stock of 73 apartments at Harrisson Court having only 16 parking spots, locals have launched a petition to join the resident parking scheme, highlighting issues with overcrowded options on the street and unpermitted parking. 

While Plumlife, the management, acknowledges the limited spaces due to planning rules, some residents express concerns about the pressure on parking in the area. Local councillor Asa Caton shares worries that even with a permit scheme, there may not be enough spaces to meet demand, as both new residents and visitors contribute to the congestion. Current residents, including those in neighboring flats, fear that the influx of new flats might worsen the situation, stressing the need for additional solutions as Stockport continues to grow.
