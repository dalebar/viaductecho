The Home Secretary has expressed strong disapproval of pro-Palestine marches that occurred just hours after a terror attack outside Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, which claimed the lives of two men. Shabana Mahmood labelled the protests "un-British" and "dishonourable," calling for a pause in such demonstrations to allow the Jewish community to mourn. Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged support for Jewish communities in the wake of the attack, which police have classified as terror-related. The Chief Rabbi voiced concerns about the rising antisemitism and linked it to the protests, urging the government to curb demonstrations he deems dangerous. Community leaders highlighted a surge in antisemitic incidents since the onset of recent Middle Eastern conflicts. Marc Levy from the Jewish Representative Council noted a sharp rise in antisemitism across various societal sectors. The overall sentiment is one of deep concern for community safety and a call for solidarity amidst a troubling climate.
