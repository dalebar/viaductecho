Plans for a ‘green gateway’ estate in Stockport have been unveiled, proposing 106 new homes on land owned by Stockport Grammar School. The location on Dialstone Lane, previously unused for seven years, will feature tree-lined streets and a variety of housing options from one to five bedrooms, with half of them designated as “affordable” homes. This development aims to address the housing needs in Stockport, where over 9,000 people are on the social housing list. The area is well-connected, close to the A6 and Stepping Hill Hospital, making it a sustainable choice. The design focuses on creating a welcoming neighbourhood with minimal car dominance. There's already significant interest, with over 80 local comments received, and Stockport Council aims to decide on the proposal by April 29.
