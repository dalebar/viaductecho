Plans for a 'green gateway' estate in Stockport have been unveiled, proposing 106 new homes on previously unused land by Story Homes and Stockport Grammar School. The site, which has not been used for sports pitches due to its distance from the main school, aims to address housing pressures in the area, where over 9,000 people are on the social housing list. The proposal includes a range of one to five-bedroom homes, with half being designated as 'affordable' options, like shared ownership and affordable rents. The design features treelined streets and green frontages for a pleasant arrival experience. Located near key transport links and amenities, the development is expected to create a vibrant neighbourhood that blends well with the existing character of Stockport. So far, the plans have attracted over 80 comments from local residents, and a decision is expected by April 29.
