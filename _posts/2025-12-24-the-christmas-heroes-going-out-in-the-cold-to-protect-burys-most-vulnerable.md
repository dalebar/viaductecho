Ribblesdale Medical Practice in Bury has gone above and beyond this winter by launching a voluntary outreach clinic for the homeless and those at risk of homelessness. Since October, the clinic, led by Nurse Consultant Karen Swift and Practice Business Manager Lynsey Philbin, has been providing essential services like flu vaccinations and health checks at The Red Door Centre. Recognised as Manchester Evening News Christmas Heroes, they’ve built trust with vulnerable residents who usually avoid traditional healthcare settings. 

Starting with basic consultations, the outreach has significantly benefitted many, including life-changing discoveries like diabetes. Karen's proactive approach includes delivering flu jabs directly on the streets, ensuring that healthcare reaches those who might otherwise miss out. Despite challenges like the cold weather and busy schedules, their determination remains unwavering. The outreach aims to create a safe space where patients feel welcome, helping to address the severe health inequalities faced by rough sleepers. Their efforts not only bring immediate care but also foster long-term support, making a profound impact on the lives of those often overlooked.
