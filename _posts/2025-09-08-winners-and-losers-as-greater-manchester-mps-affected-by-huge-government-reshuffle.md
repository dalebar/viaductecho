Ashton's MP resignation sparked a major cabinet reshuffle, deeply impacting Greater Manchester's political scene. Angela Rayner was the most notable casualty, stepping down as Deputy Prime Minister and Labour's Deputy Leader over stamp duty issues, marking a significant fall from power for a prominent northern figure. Sir Keir Starmer's response was to overhaul the cabinet instead of simply replacing her. 

Lisa Nandy from Wigan is now the most senior Greater Manchester MP, staying on as Culture Secretary. Jonathan Reynolds from Stalybridge shifted roles, becoming Chief Whip. However, Lucy Powell and Jim McMahon lost their government jobs as Leader of the House and Local Government Secretary, respectively. 

Josh Simons has stepped in as Parliamentary Secretary, covering for an MP on maternity leave, while Christian Wakeford and Andrew Western retained their positions in the government. Mike Kane and Jeff Smith, however, lost their roles as Parliamentary Under Secretary and Government Whip. The Prime Minister promised a renewed focus on delivery in this reshuffled Government, aiming to fulfill the promises made to voters.
