A police cordon has been set up near a shooting in Manchester's Gay Village, specifically on Princess Street, where forensic teams are investigating a parked Mercedes G-Class linked to the incident. The shooting occurred on Richmond Street, close to Canal Street, with a man in his 20s found with a gunshot wound to his leg. Fortunately, his injuries aren't life-threatening. Six men, aged 23 to 26, have been arrested on suspicion of firearms offences and remain in custody. Superintendent Stephen Wiggins reassured the public that the incident appears targeted, posing no wider threat. He emphasised the seriousness of gun crime, highlighting that 168 firearms have been seized in Greater Manchester this year alone. Authorities are asking for anyone with information or footage to reach out to GMP.
