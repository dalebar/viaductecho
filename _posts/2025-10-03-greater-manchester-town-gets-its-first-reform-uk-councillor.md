Wigan voters have made a bold move, electing Lee Moffitt from Reform UK as the town's first councillor from that party, snubbing the Labour group's control in a recent by-election. Moffitt, a former Royal Military Policeman, won the Wigan Central seat by 421 votes, securing 1,391 votes compared to Labour's Adam Boon with 970. After his victory, Moffitt expressed his thoughts for the victims of a recent Manchester terror attack, stressing the need for collaboration with the council to benefit Wigan's residents. He aims for this win to pave the way for more Reform councillors in future elections. Moffitt, a father of five, emphasised his motivation is for the next generation, despite the tough campaign season. The turnout was a modest 30.9%, with Labour still holding 63 seats while Conservatives and Liberal Democrats saw dismal results.
