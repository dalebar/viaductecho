Greater Manchester’s always buzzing with new projects and developments that aim to make life better for its residents. From health campuses and parks to civic squares and swimming pools, there's no shortage of exciting plans. Recently highlighted is the transformation around the Royal Bolton Hospital, promising new housing and green spaces. 

In the city centre, a nifty project called 'Pigeon Triangle' is set to create a park near Piccadilly Station, part of a larger residential scheme with 900 homes. Rochdale, Tameside, Trafford, and Stockport are also gearing up for their own improvements, like the proposed £20m Pride in Place plan for Heywood, targeting town centre upgrades and opportunities for young folks. 

Droylsden could see a new swimming pool in an unused retail site, while Stockport might gain over 400 new homes, including plans near High Lane. Lastly, Trafford football club has submitted its own application for a new clubhouse and upgraded facilities. It’s all about revitalising the community while keeping the local spirit alive!
