Greater Manchester is bracing for more snow as Storm Goretti hits the UK tomorrow, Thursday 8th January. This ‘multi-hazard’ storm is coming in from the south west and is expected to develop throughout the day, bringing strong winds, rain, hail, and snow by late afternoon and evening. The Met Office predicts snow starting around 6pm in areas like Tameside, Oldham, and Rochdale, with possible impacts in Cheshire and Derbyshire too. There are already weather warnings in place, including an amber snow warning from 8pm tomorrow until 9am Friday. Met Office Chief Forecaster Neil Armstrong mentioned that while Wales and the Midlands might see the heaviest snow, Greater Manchester could still face significant snowfall. An amber cold health alert has also been extended by the UK Health Security Agency, warning that low temperatures could affect health until Sunday. Stay safe and warm, folks!
