Greater Manchester woke up to a snowy scene again, thanks to a chilly Arctic blast. After Sunday night’s snowfall continued into Monday, the region saw more flurries today. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for ice in effect from midnight to 10 am tomorrow. While some areas enjoyed bright skies previously, today started off rather grey. Our photographer has been busy capturing the wintry sights, with snow spotted at various locations including the Leigh Guided Busway, Chadderton, St Peters Square, Piccadilly Gardens, and Lilford Park in Leigh. Looks like winter's sticking around, eh?
