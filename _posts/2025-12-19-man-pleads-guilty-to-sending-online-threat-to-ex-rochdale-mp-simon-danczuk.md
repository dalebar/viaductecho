Zaffar Hussain, 25, from Rochdale, has pleaded guilty to sending an online threat to former MP Simon Danczuk, disrupting Danczuk’s campaign during the Rochdale by-election. This incident occurred just before the election for Reform UK on February 26, 2024, following the death of Labour MP Tony Lloyd. Hussain was arrested the next day by Greater Manchester Police. Danczuk described the threat as distressing for him and his family, leading to significant security measures, including relocating his wife to London and hiring security personnel. Danczuk thanked the police for their help. The election was ultimately won by George Galloway of the Workers Party, but the Labour seat was regained in a general election later that year. Hussain's next court appearance is scheduled for February 25, 2026.
