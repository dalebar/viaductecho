Denton's got exciting plans in the pipeline! Town hall bosses are set to approve a £16.8m vision to turn the place into a greener, safer, and more vibrant town by the end of the decade. Nearly £3m of government cash is earmarked for revamping the Festival Hall and patching up Denton Town Hall. They're targeting streets like Queen Street for greener spaces and enhancing walking and cycling routes with more than 1.1km dedicated to active travel. The initial works are slated for completion by March 2026, with a focus on community needs like transport, youth facilities, and green areas. Urban design specialists Planit IE are helping shape these changes for a more connected town. The council's bigwig, Coun Andrew McLaren, says this is a golden chance to celebrate Denton's local identity. They’re also on the hunt for extra funding to expand the vision further. The Denton Public Realm Masterplan gets its official nod on December 17. Exciting times ahead for Denton!
