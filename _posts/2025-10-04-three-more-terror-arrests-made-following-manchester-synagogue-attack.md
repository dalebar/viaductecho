Three additional individuals have been arrested on terrorism charges following a tragic attack on a synagogue in north Manchester on October 2. Police rushed to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation after reports of a vehicle being driven at people, leading to the driver, identified as Jihad al-Shamie, using a knife on bystanders. Sadly, two members of the Jewish community lost their lives, and three others are in serious condition. Six people are now in custodyâ€”initial arrests included two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, and the new arrests involve a man and two women aged 18 to mid-40s. The police are continuing their investigations and urge the public to avoid speculation. They are seeking further detention warrants for all individuals arrested. For updates, the public is encouraged to contact police with any information.
