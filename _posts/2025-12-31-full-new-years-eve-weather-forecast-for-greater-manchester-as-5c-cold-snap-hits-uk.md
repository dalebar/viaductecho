It’s going to be a chilly New Year’s Eve in Greater Manchester, with freezing temps set to linger below 0°C until after 9am. Expect the day to stay under 5°C, feeling around -2°C at times. Cloudy skies should keep it dry for any fireworks viewing, but rain is expected to start around 2am on New Year's Day. January 1 should be mostly dry with temperatures around 5°C, then we’re in for a real chill over the weekend with highs only reaching 2°C as a cold snap hits. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber cold health alerts for the North East and North West due to expected lows of -5°C, warning of impacts on health services, especially for the elderly or those with health issues. For revellers, it’s advised to bundle up for the festivities. While London and Cardiff might have slightly milder conditions, visibility for fireworks looks good despite cloud cover. Meanwhile, Scotland’s bracing for heavy snow and a yellow weather warning for ice, which may disrupt travel as we kick off the new year.
