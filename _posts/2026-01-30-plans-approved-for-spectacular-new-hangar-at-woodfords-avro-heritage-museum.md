Plans for a new hangar at the Avro Heritage Museum in Woodford have been given the green light, part of a £10m expansion to showcase six previously stored aircraft, including the Avro Shackleton. This new exhibition space hopes to draw more visitors to the museum, well-known for displaying iconic aircraft like the Avro Vulcan and Lancaster Bomber. Stockport Council approved the project on 22 January, and the museum will soon launch a fundraising campaign to support the build. Terry Barnes, the museum's chairman, expressed enthusiasm for the project, highlighting how it will allow the public to explore the history of the Avro company, from its humble origins in an Ancoats cotton mill to its status as a producer of world-renowned aircraft.
