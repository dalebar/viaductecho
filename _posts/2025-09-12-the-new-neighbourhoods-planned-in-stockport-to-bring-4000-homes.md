Stockport town centre is set for a major transformation with plans for around 4,000 new homes, including affordable options, across three new neighbourhoods. The proposed development aims to create more natural spaces, a health hub, and pedestrian-friendly streets to promote healthy living. Key areas include Goyt riverside for a residential community with new parks, and a focus on the historic Piccadilly area with properties that respect Stockport's heritage. The Hillgate neighbourhood will enhance connectivity with green spaces. The council and Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) are leading this regeneration, which is part of a broader vision for 8,000 new homes over the next 15 years. However, there's notable concern about ensuring sufficient affordable housing. The plans are currently under discussion, with a council team review scheduled. Overall, this redevelopment is seen as a pivotal opportunity for Stockport’s future, but there’s a call for a balanced approach to meeting local housing needs.
