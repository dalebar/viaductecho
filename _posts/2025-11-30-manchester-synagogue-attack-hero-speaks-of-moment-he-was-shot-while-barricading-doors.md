Yoni Finlay, a father-of-four, has shared his experience from the tragic terrorist attack at Heaton Park synagogue, where he helped barricade the doors against Jihad Al-Shamie, who was armed with a large knife. During the chaos, police shot Al-Shamie, but both Finlay and fellow worshipper Adrian Daulby were also struck by police bullets; sadly, Daulby died, along with another man, Melvin Cravitz, who suffered fatal stab wounds. Finlay, recovering after a lengthy hospital stay, expressed his 'survivor's guilt' and described the terror he witnessed, stating, "I saw evil" as he faced the attacker. He does not blame the police for their response, recognising their actions saved lives. Greater Manchester Police have since reinforced their commitment to community safety, conducting over 20,000 visits to places of worship. An inquiry revealed the details of the attack, confirming the tragic outcomes for Daulby and Cravitz. Finlay emphasised the importance of combating hate with positivity, saying, "Let’s bring light into the world."
