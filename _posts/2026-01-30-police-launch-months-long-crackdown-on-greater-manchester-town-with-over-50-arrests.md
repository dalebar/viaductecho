More than 50 arrests have been made in Heywood, Greater Manchester, as part of a police crackdown on crime that ran from March to December last year. The operation focused on drug-dealing but expanded to tackle various associated crimes, resulting in the recovery of over £1.5 million worth of drugs, along with illicit cash, vehicles, and weapons like machetes and zombie knives. Police also aimed to protect vulnerable residents exploited by criminals. GMP’s Heywood Neighbourhood Policing Team highlighted their commitment to disruptive actions against criminal networks, with ongoing investigations and successful closure orders on properties involved in 'cuckooing,' where criminals take over vulnerable individuals' homes for drug activities. Sergeant Hannah Taala praised the operation's achievements, emphasizing the importance of safety and support for victims in the community.
