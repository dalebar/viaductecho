- **Monday**: Cloudy with rain likely; temps at 7-13°C. High humidity and brisk winds.
- **Tuesday**: Partly cloudy with more rain; temperatures between 6-9°C.
- **Wednesday**: A break from rain, partly cloudy; cooler at 4-8°C.
- **Thursday**: Mostly cloudy; temps around 3-8°C with a slight chance of rain.

- **Saturday**: High chance of rain at 55%, temps 6-8°C; waterproofs needed.

This week looks chillier and wetter than last week’s sunshine. So, if you’re commuting or planning weekend fun, keep an umbrella handy and maybe have a few indoor plans up your sleeve!
