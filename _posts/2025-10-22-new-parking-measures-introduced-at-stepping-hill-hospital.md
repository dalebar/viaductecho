Stepping Hill Hospital has introduced new parking measures to enhance accessibility and safety. Key changes include parking enforcement with officers patrolling the area to ensure vehicles are parked correctly and displaying the appropriate permits. Staff will have designated barriered parking areas, accessible only with a permit and staff ID badge. New criteria for permits will consider staff proximity to the hospital. The fine for improper parking is £70, reduced to £35 if settled within 14 days, consistent with other NHS organisations in Greater Manchester. The Stockport NHS Trust engaged with visitors, patients, and staff to develop these measures. They aim to address parking issues and improve safety for the 5,900 staff and many visitors daily, promoting a better experience at the hospital.
