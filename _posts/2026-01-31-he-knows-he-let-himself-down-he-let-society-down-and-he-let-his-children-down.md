Azad Hussain, a 43-year-old drug dealer, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for brokering deals involving multiple kilos of cocaine and cannabis. His operations, taking place on the encrypted messaging platform EncroChat from March to June 2020, were uncovered after a police infiltration in June 2020. Hussain communicated with around 15 individuals, discussing transactions worth over £112,000 for cannabis and £75,000 for two kilos of cocaine. His phone, seized in February 2025, revealed ongoing conversations about various drugs up until July 2024. Despite having previous convictions dating back to 2011, Hussain expressed remorse for his actions, highlighting the impact on his family. His lawyer noted his efforts at rehabilitation during custody, including educational courses and mentoring fellow inmates. Judge Tina Landale acknowledged the systematic nature of Hussain's drug operations but recognised his genuine commitment to reform. A hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act is planned to recover the criminal gains.
