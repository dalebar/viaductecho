Police were called to the Jolly Crofter pub on Castle Street, Edgeley, Stockport, after a man got a nasty head injury during a fight around 5.15pm. He had a significant cut but refused medical help at the scene. Witnesses reported a heavy police presence, as one man was seen covered in blood. This incident was distinct from another earlier situation nearby on Aberdeen Crescent, where riot police were deployed due to welfare concerns for another person. A man from that incident was taken to hospital but, thankfully, no one was seriously injured, and GMP assured the public that there was no wider risk.
