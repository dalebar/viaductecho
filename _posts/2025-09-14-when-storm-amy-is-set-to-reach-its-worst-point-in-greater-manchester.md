Get ready for some blustery weather in Manchester! We're expecting gusts up to 50mph on Monday afternoon, with similar strong winds hitting most of England and Wales over the next couple of days. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for wind from 8pm Sunday till 6pm Monday. While this isn't a named storm, it could still cause transport delays and large waves along the coast, plus the chance of short-term power cuts. For Greater Manchester, winds peak at around 36mph on Sunday evening, then ramp up to 48mph by midday Monday. Thereâ€™s a break in the weather on Tuesday, but another windy system might develop by Wednesday. The RAC advises drivers to be cautious, especially on exposed routes and to reduce speeds due to challenging conditions. Stay safe out there!
