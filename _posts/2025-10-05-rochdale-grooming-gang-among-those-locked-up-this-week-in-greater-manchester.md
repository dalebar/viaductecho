Seven men have been sentenced to a combined 174 years for abusing two teenage girls in Rochdale during the early 2000s. The girls were groomed and treated as 'sex slaves,' enduring horrific conditions. Meanwhile, a senior prison officer, Amie Turner from Bolton, was jailed for 15 months for having a relationship with an inmate and using a smuggled phone to communicate with him. 

In other cases, Callum Noble, 26, extorted money from his deceased friend's drug customers, resulting in a 6-year prison sentence. Ashley Farrell, 43, was sentenced to 12 months in prison for pressuring his partner to retract a statement against him. 

A drunk woman, Katherine Pye, has been jailed for four years after attacking a stranger with a broken bottle. Lastly, a tragic case saw 16-year-old Dean Barnes die while riding a stolen bike. The rider, Adam Norman, received a 16-and-a-half-year sentence, while the homeowner chasing them was found not guilty.
