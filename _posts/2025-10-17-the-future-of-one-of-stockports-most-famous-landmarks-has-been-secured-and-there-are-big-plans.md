St Mary's Church in Stockport, the town’s oldest and a historic landmark, is set for a transformation thanks to a £343,000 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. This funding aims to safeguard the church, which has stood since at least 1190 and is urgently in need of repairs. Plans include turning it into a vibrant cultural hub, with features like guided tours, an updated café, escape rooms, live gigs, and food festivals, making the space more welcoming for the community. The project hopes to keep St Mary’s relevant and accessible, while also addressing environmental concerns like energy use. Local council leaders are enthusiastic, emphasising the importance of this heritage site and its role in Stockport's community. Rev. Chris Blunt expresses hope for an inviting future where the church continues to be a place of worship and historical connection for locals. Overall, this initiative illustrates Stockport's commitment to enhancing its cultural landscape and supporting its history.
