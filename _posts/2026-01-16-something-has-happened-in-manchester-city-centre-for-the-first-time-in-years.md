Councillors in Manchester have turned down a skyscraper proposal by Liquid Funding Business (LFB) for the first time in years, critiquing the plans for not including affordable flats and instead offering ‘fancy yoga studios.’ The developers aimed to construct two towers of 50 and 25 storeys on Great Ancoats Street, but faced backlash from residents concerned about light loss to the neighbouring Oxygen tower. LFB representatives argued the natural light would be acceptable for city centre locations, but councillors highlighted multiple issues, including the project’s failure to comply with the city’s strategic regeneration framework (SRF), economic feasibility, and the accommodation of diverse housing needs. The proposal was unanimously rejected, although LFB can revise and resubmit their plans. In a separate matter, councillors approved a temporary extension for a controversial marquee at the British Muslim Heritage Centre, provided noise tests and a new management plan are established to address local complaints about events hosted there.
