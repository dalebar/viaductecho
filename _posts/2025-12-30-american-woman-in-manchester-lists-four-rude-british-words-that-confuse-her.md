Ashley Jackson, an American woman living in Manchester, has shared amusing cultural differences she’s encountered since moving from Texas. Though both countries speak English, she found major vocabulary quirks that caused confusion. For instance, "braces" in the UK support trousers, whereas in the US, they’re for teeth; Americans use "suspenders" instead, which in the UK refers to something quite risqué. She encountered the word "fanny," which is innocent in the US but is a bit shocking in the UK context, where it refers to a part of the body that isn’t often mentioned! Similarly, "rubber" means eraser in the UK but is slang for a condom in the US, leading to some funny moments with her kids. Lastly, "pants" in America means trousers, but in the UK, it's underwear, resulting in some embarrassing slip-ups. Ashley's experiences highlight just how entertaining and tricky these language differences can be!
