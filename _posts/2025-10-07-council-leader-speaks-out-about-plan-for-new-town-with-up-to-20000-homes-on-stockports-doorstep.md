The leader of Stockport council, Cllr Mark Roberts, has slammed plans for a new town near Stockport that could add up to 20,000 homes, stating it feels like a hasty decision from Westminster. The New Towns Taskforce is pushing for large-scale housing to address England's housing shortage, but Roberts is worried about the impact on local services, suggesting that many future residents might end up commuting through Stockport. He accused the Labour government of neglecting local concerns and rushing to meet unrealistic housing targets. Cheadle's Lib Dem MP, Tom Morrison, echoed these concerns, emphasising the lack of consultation and the strain on existing infrastructure. Meanwhile, Stockport's Labour group defended the government's plans, arguing for the need for affordable housing. There’s a tug-of-war over local development as Stockport’s Lib Dems work on a local plan to manage future housing while facing higher targets from the government, with fears that speculative developments could threaten greenbelt areas. The debate highlights the balance between housing needs and preserving local communities.
