Salford is gearing up for its 2026 centenary celebrations after becoming a city in 1926, with new exhibitions at the Salford Museum and Art Gallery featuring 100 artworks chosen by locals. A selection of "Salford Heroes" will be recognised throughout the year, highlighting influential figures from various fields, likely including local icons like Albert Finney and John Cooper Clarke. Meanwhile, the community is still reeling from the destruction of the Clarendon Leisure Centre by arson in May 2024. The council is aiming to replace it with a new sports centre on a new site, with potential funding support from Sport England. Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett emphasised the urgent need for modern leisure facilities to tackle health inequalities in the area. The council is working closely with local leaders and the community to bring the new centre to life, promising features like a swimming pool and fitness suites. As the centenary approaches, there's hope that the new centre will provide a lasting legacy and uplift the community's health and well-being amid ongoing challenges.
