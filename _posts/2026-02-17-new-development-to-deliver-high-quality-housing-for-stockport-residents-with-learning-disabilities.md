Work has begun on a new housing development in Stockport aimed at residents with learning disabilities. Located on the former Bredbury civic hall site, the project will offer 12 high-quality homes, set to open in March 2027. These include four self-contained apartments with 24-hour staff access, enabling residents to live independently while also receiving necessary support. The development features various shared facilities for socialising and skill-building, including a communal lounge, kitchen and dining area, shower facilities, laundry room, staff office, and sleep-in room. The building will achieve an EPC A rating for energy efficiency and is constructed on brownfield land, supported by MSV Housing Group, Stockport Council, Homes England, and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. Local officials are emphasising the importance of providing safe, inclusive homes for everyone, highlighting this project as a crucial step towards enhancing community living for those with learning disabilities. Charlie Norman, CEO of MSV, underlined the project’s significance in transforming neglected sites into valuable community resources.
