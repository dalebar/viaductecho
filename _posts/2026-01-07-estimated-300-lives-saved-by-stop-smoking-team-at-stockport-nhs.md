The Stockport NHS Foundation Trust's CURE team is celebrating a milestone of saving 300 lives through its specialist stop smoking support for hospital patients. Founded five years ago, the team has helped over 5,000 smokers since 2020. Research shows that for every 1,000 patients seen, about 60 lives are saved, contributing to this impressive figure. Natasha Gilraine from CURE highlighted tobacco’s impact as the leading cause of preventable death and expressed pride in the team's achievements and ongoing commitment to improving local health. Last year alone, their efforts reportedly prevented 113 hospital re-admissions. With the new year around the corner, many are considering quitting smoking.
