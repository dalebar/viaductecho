While many are enjoying their Christmas Day, NHS staff across Greater Manchester are hard at work, ensuring patients receive the care they need. With a focus on spreading festive cheer, doctors, nurses, and hospital workers are making the most of the day by decorating wards and creating special moments for patients. 

Nurse Festus Omeike from Moston highlighted efforts to celebrate by putting up decorations and crafting nativity scenes from hospital materials. Lydia Hill, a play specialist at Royal Bolton Hospital, emphasised the importance of small moments of joy to help create a safe, calm environment in the hospital.

The Manchester Evening News shared photos of these dedicated teams, including those at Stepping Hill Hospital, Fairfield Hospital, and Salford Royal, all committed to cheering up patients on this special day. From the trauma team to neonatal units, every effort is made to bring a bit of joy during a festive season that can be tough for those in hospital.
