Members of the Jewish community in north Manchester are reeling after a shocking attack outside a synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. A car drove at pedestrians near Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, resulting in two fatalities and several serious injuries. The police quickly declared it a major incident and implemented a national emergency response code. Witnesses described hearing shots and experiencing utter chaos, with some swarming to safety led by Rabbi Daniel Walker. Community residents expressed disbelief that such violence could occur in their close-knit area known for its diversity and togetherness. Leaders from the Community Security Trust emphasised the growing threat the Jewish community faces, citing rising antisemitism. Security measures have been tightened at synagogues across Greater Manchester. Local politicians and residents conveyed their shock and solidarity. The incident has left the tight-knit community grappling with fear and a desire for increased unity and protection against hatred.
