A body was discovered near Bridgewater Hall in Manchester on Boxing Day morning, prompting a police investigation. The area is known as a spot where some homeless people sleep, located by the Rochdale Canal Lake amidst office buildings and apartments. Greater Manchester Police confirmed they received reports at 9:30 AM and pronounced the male deceased at the scene, noting the death is not deemed suspicious. They're exploring the possibility he may have died while sleeping rough, with temperatures dropping to around 4C overnight. A police tent was set up for much of the day as inquiries continued. A social media post highlighted the stark contrast of festive celebrations for some, reminding everyone that not everyone has a warm or joyous holiday season. Further information is expected to be released soon.
