Manchester's health leaders are frustrated with the low uptake of vaccinations, particularly in the wake of the Covid pandemic that highlighted their importance. This time of year sees a rise in infections from Covid-19, flu, and measles due to children returning to school and colder weather, leading to hospital pressures. Despite vaccination being vital to public health and preventing disease, trust in the system remains low, exacerbated by vaccine hesitancy and myths, especially around the MMR vaccine and autism.

Last year's vaccination rates didn't meet the 95% target needed for herd immunity, with measles cases spiking, including fatalities linked to unvaccinated individuals. Manchester's public health officials are working hard to increase awareness and trust among residents, using creative strategies to bring vaccinations directly to communities. Theyâ€™ve seen improvements, such as a rise in whooping cough vaccinations among pregnant women and a decrease in unvaccinated children for MMR. Health officials are committed to this ongoing effort to boost vaccination rates, emphasising the protective benefits for both the individuals and the community.
