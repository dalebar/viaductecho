Mytham Road in Little Lever, Bolton, is closed due to a sinkhole that appeared near Mytham Primary School on Thursday, January 23. United Utilities identified a burst pipe as the cause. Engineers are on site for a second day, with repairs expected to carry on into the weekend. The council assures that the work will likely wrap up over the weekend, and residents are being asked to steer clear of the area for safety. Thanks have been given to locals for their patience during this disruption.
