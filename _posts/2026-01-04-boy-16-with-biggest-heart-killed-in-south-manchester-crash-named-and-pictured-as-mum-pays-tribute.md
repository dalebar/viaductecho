A teenager named Alfie Moran tragically lost his life after being hit by a car while crossing Kingsway in Burnage, south Manchester, on January 2. The 16-year-old suffered severe injuries and later died in hospital. An 18-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident, and a police investigation is ongoing. Alfie's mother, in a heartfelt tribute, described him as a "special boy" with a big heart, expressing how deeply their family is affected by the loss. A fundraiser has been set up to support Alfie's family during this difficult time, with organisers highlighting how loved he was. The Serious Collision Investigation Unit is asking anyone with information or potential dashcam footage of the incident to come forward, ensuring the community is involved in seeking justice for Alfie.
