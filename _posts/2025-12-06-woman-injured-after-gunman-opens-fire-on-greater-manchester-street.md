Two men have been arrested in Salford after a gunman opened fire outside a house on Wally Square. The incident occurred on Thursday evening, leaving a woman in her 20s with minor injuries, the cause of which is still under investigation. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) reported that the shooter arrived on an electric bike and discharged the firearm before fleeing. The two suspects, aged 24 and 28, are in custody on suspicion of firearm possession with intent to endanger life. GMP reassured the public that there is no wider threat to the community and are asking for any witnesses or anyone with relevant footage to come forward. Detective Inspector Louise Edwards stated that such acts are intolerable and emphasised their commitment to ensuring safety in Greater Manchester, urging anyone with information to contact them or the charity Crimestoppers.
