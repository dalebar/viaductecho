A van was stolen in Greater Manchester with the owner's three dogs inside, prompting an urgent police search. The theft occurred on Swanney Lodge Road by the New Hall Hey retail park on January 13 at around 11:24 am. The burnt orange Ford Transit contained two cocker spaniels and a Weimaraner, which didn't have collars. The owner's desperate social media post went viral, garnering over 7,000 shares. Fortunately, by around 7 pm the same day, the police confirmed that both the van and the dogs were found elsewhere in Lancashire. Lancashire Police announced they were investigating the theft, but there's no word yet on any arrests linked to the incident.
