Residents in Greater Manchester's Gorton and Denton are gearing up for a by-election to choose a new MP following the retirement of Labour's Andrew Gwynne, who stepped down on health grounds. The election date is still to be announced. Gwynne, who held the seat with a 13,000-strong majority in July 2024, was later suspended from the party in 2025 for sending offensive WhatsApp messages. A list of candidates will be shared in alphabetical order as they get confirmed. Keep an ear out for updates and engage with BBC Radio Manchester for the latest!
