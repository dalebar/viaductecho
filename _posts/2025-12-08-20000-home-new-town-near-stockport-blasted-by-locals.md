Residents near a proposed 20,000-home development in Adlington, Cheshire, are up in arms over plans that threaten local greenbelt and farmland. The £8 billion project by developers Belport aims to transform 2,400 acres of countryside into a new town, complete with schools and health centres. Locals, including long-time resident Aysha Hawcutt, express concerns about losing their rural lifestyle and wildlife habitats, fearing the development may merge Stockport and Macclesfield into one big estate. The proposed houses, starting around £400,000, are deemed unaffordable by residents, who want smaller starter homes instead. Critics argue that the development, touted as a solution to the housing crisis, could lead to chaos on local roads and the loss of vital farming livelihoods—impacting milk and beef production in the area. With plans set to be discussed by Cheshire East Council in January, there’s palpable worry about the environmental and social ramifications of such a large-scale project.
