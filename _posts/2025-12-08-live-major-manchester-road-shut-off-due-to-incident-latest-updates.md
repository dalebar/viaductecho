A crash has led to the closure of Princess Road (A5103) in both directions, near Moss Lane East, causing queues in the area. Greater Manchester Police have been alerted for more details. After some time, it’s now confirmed that the incident has cleared and the road has reopened, unrelated to another collision on the M60 a bit further away, which has also cleared. More updates will follow as we get additional info from GMP.
