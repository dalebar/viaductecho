Sticky Fingers, previously a popular stall in Stockport Market Hall, has opened a new bakery and café at 39 Great Underbank, across from the White Lion pub. Owned by husband and wife duo Adrian and Klaudyna, the Polish artisan bakery offers a delightful selection of fresh bakes, including traditional pastries and Japanese omelettes, alongside bread, sandwiches, and drinks. Since its opening on 22 November, it’s received rave reviews, with EatMCR calling it 'lovely' and highlighting the option to watch the baking process from downstairs or relax on the top floor. After nearly a year of renovations and challenges, the couple is thrilled to open this new chapter. Sticky Fingers is now a fixture in Stockport town centre, welcoming visitors from Monday to Sunday. Keep an eye on their Instagram for updates!
