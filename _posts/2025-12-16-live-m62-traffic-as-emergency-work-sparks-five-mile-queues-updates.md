Traffic on the M62 eastbound had a rough patch this afternoon due to emergency repair work. Two lanes were shut between junctions 18 and 19, causing long queues and delays of up to 20 minutes, with congestion stretching back five miles to junction 16. National Highways kept everyone updated via social media. 

Luckily, the situation has improved, and all lanes have now reopened. However, traffic is still queuing for about four miles up to the previous closure, with delays of around 15 minutes noted. So, if you're heading that way, best to stay patient!
