Stockport’s Garrick Theatre, the UK’s oldest 'little theatre', is on the lookout for a creative artist or collective to design a large mural that captures the essence of theatre and community. The aim is to add vibrancy and energy to the building's exterior, inviting people to connect with its rich history.

Interested artists should submit a short proposal (1-2 paragraphs) and light sketches or concept visuals, as well as links to their portfolio featuring previous large-scale work. The mural should reflect the Garrick’s heritage, celebrate Stockport’s cultural identity, and feature themes like performance and transformation, using bold colours and dynamic compositions.

The budget for the project is £12,000, which includes artist fees, materials, and installation. Submit your proposals by 20th June 2025, with installation planned for Summer 2025. For submissions, email Shaun Freeman-Jones at totallystockport. Let’s make this mural a standout piece!
