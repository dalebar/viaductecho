Michael Jolley has stepped down as manager of Bury FC just two days after his appointment due to backlash over his past conviction involving an underage girl. The club's board acknowledged the strong feelings from fans and stakeholders about his appointment and relieved him of his duties by mutual consent. Jolley, who previously managed Grimsby Town and Barrow, maintained that he was misled about the girl's age and did not act maliciously. He expressed that his presence was becoming a distraction for the club and decided to step aside for the betterment of Bury FC, emphasising the importance of safeguarding in coaching. Assistant manager Tim Lees will take over on an interim basis while the board reviews club operations. Bury FC aims to restore confidence and act with integrity, promising further updates as needed.
