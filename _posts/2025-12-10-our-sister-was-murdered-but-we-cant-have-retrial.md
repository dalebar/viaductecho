The family of a millionaire who drowned believes they've found new evidence from her smartwatch, indicating she died 29 minutes before her husband, Mr McPherson, claimed he tried to rescue her. However, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided not to retry him for murder, stating that the legal criteria for an appeal haven't been met. Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, reviewed the case thoroughly and concluded they can't proceed. Jake Richards from the Ministry of Justice has agreed to meet with the family to discuss their concerns. Mr Leeson, the family spokesman, expressed frustration, claiming it's unjust that available evidence could indicate murder but legislative hurdles are preventing justice. In a twist, Mr McPherson has a tragic history too, having lost his first wife and child in a house fire.
