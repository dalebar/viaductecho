Jewish leaders and several MPs are quite worried about Bob Vylan's upcoming gig at Manchester Academy. This concern follows the band's controversial performance at Glastonbury, where frontman Bobby Vylan shouted "death to the IDF," leading to many complaints and a ruling from the BBC’s Executive Complaints Unit that deemed the broadcast harmful and offensive. In light of recent events, including a terror attack on a Manchester synagogue, community leaders are asking for the concert to be cancelled. They highlight that Vylan's past statements, including mocking violence and making derogatory remarks about Jews, cross the line from political discourse into antisemitism. They argue that while freedom of expression is important, it shouldn't come at the expense of legitimising hate. Several local MPs support this call for cancellation, backing the Jewish Representative Council’s plea for clearer policies to prevent such rhetoric being platformed. Manchester Academy has yet to respond to these concerns.
