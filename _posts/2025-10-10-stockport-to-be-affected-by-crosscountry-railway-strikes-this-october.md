Train staff at CrossCountry are going on strike on 18 October, leading to "very limited" service and "significant disruption," particularly along the Birmingham to Manchester route, which includes Stockport. The strikes are organised by the RMT union, and another strike is planned for 1 November. Shiona Rolfe, the Managing Director, expressed disappointment over the situation but assured efforts to run services where possible. The company is keen to resolve the issues and continues to welcome talks with the RMT. For further details, check CrossCountry's website.
