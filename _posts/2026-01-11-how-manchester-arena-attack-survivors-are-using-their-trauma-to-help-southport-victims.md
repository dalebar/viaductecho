Survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing are now mentoring teachers in Sefton, following the tragic stabbings at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class that killed three young girls. The initiative, a collaboration between the National Emergencies Trust and Lancaster University, aims to equip educators with the tools needed to support students affected by trauma. Many survivors shared their experiences from the 2017 bombing, highlighting the gaps in support they faced at school, often needing to repeatedly recount their experiences. The workshops, led by Manchester survivors, encourage teachers to pay closer attention to students who may be quietly struggling. The momentum for this project is driven by the hope that other students can have a better experience than they did. The teachers involved found the insights invaluable, focusing on resilience and moving forward together. As the workshops continue, there’s potential for expanding support to other areas affected by trauma. Overall, the effort is about fostering a community of understanding, resilience, and hope for affected young people.
