Stockport Council has rejected plans for a new Asda Express in Offerton, which would have replaced a car repair garage at Chippenham Avenue and Marple Road. Local residents raised concerns about increased congestion, parking issues, and potential harm to nearby businesses, especially given the existing options like Lidl and Aldi. Planners highlighted that the store's design would complicate access for delivery vehicles, risking safety due to required reversing manoeuvres. Complaints included the proposed restriction on vehicle lengths, which would be unrealistic as most delivery trucks are longer. Additionally, the plans would have reduced on-site parking, likely pushing customers to park on the street, causing further safety concerns. It’s clear the council prioritised the well-being of the local community and traffic safety in their decision.
