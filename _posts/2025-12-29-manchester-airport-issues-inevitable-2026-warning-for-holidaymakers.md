Manchester Airport has warned holidaymakers that airfares are expected to rise in 2026 due to significant increases in property tax. Regional airports across the UK, including Manchester, are facing unprecedented hikes in business rates, with Manchester's bill set to jump by £4.2 million to £18.1 million. This surge follows a major property revaluation, impacting many regional airports more severely than those in London. Despite transitional relief limitations, most airports are forecasted to see their bills more than double in the next three years. Major operators, including the Manchester Airports Group, express concerns that these tax hikes could hinder their planned £2 billion investment over the next five years. AirportsUK has flagged the plans as short-sighted, warning they could negatively affect local economies reliant on airport connectivity. Other regional airports facing similar bill increases include Bristol, Birmingham, Newcastle, Liverpool, East Midlands, and Bournemouth. The trade group is advocating for a thorough review of how airport business rates are calculated to foster investment and growth.
