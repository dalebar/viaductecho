Coun Ged Cooney, the former leader of Tameside council, has resigned from the Labour Party, which he no longer recognises. He has been under suspension since last year due to the Trigger Me Timbers WhatsApp scandal, although he wasn't part of the group chat that included offensive comments about constituents. He spoke out against the chat and was suspended for discussing it with the media. Despite a pending investigation, Coun Cooney decided to leave the party, continuing to serve his Droylsden West ward as an independent councillor. He expressed disappointment over the party's direction, blaming London for dictating local decisions. Referring to his long-standing commitment to Labour, he stated, “This isn’t the party I joined,” citing issues with leadership and recent controversies involving high-profile figures. He has been critical of those who participated in the scandal being allowed back into the party and sees the national leadership as increasingly disconnected from grassroots concerns. The Labour Party did not comment on his resignation.
