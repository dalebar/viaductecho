Today, Rochdale train station was shut due to staff shortages, leaving commuters waiting outside locked gates with no trains running. This upset many, especially during peak hours. Paul Waugh, the local Labour MP, has written to Northern Railway’s bosses, expressing his concern about the disruption and the impact on passengers, including missed work and appointments. He’s seeking an explanation for the closure and wants to know what measures will be put in place to avoid this happening again. Northern Railway apologised for the inconvenience, explaining that a late arrival of a cover staff member caused the delay, and they’re looking into the situation to improve their processes. They also mentioned that affected passengers could claim compensation.
