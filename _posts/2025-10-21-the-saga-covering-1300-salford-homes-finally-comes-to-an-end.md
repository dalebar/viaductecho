Salford's long-standing housing issue has wrapped up with the council launching a landlord licensing scheme aimed at improving housing standards. The scheme targets private landlords in Broughton, Kersal, and Broughton Park, requiring them to ensure properties are safe and decent. It comes with a £609 fee for a five-year registration, covering about 1,300 properties. While the plans received backing from the Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett, they faced criticism, particularly from independent councillor Andrew Walters, who argued there wasn’t enough consultation and claimed significant housing demand in the Kersal and Broughton Park area. He also worried that the licensing costs might push rents up for tenants. Despite opposition, the council decided to proceed with the scheme, believing it helps tackle low housing demand, which is evident from the low owner-occupier rate in these areas. The new licences will provide the council with insight into the local housing market and ensure landlords remain accountable for their properties.
