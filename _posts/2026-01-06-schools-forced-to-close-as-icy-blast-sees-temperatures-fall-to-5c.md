The north west is facing a tough time with continuous snowfall and frigid temps, forcing schools in Oldham, Rochdale, and parts of Lancashire and Cheshire to close. Many shut down due to burst water pipes, with nighttime lows hitting -5C and daytime highs struggling to reach 3C. The Met Office warns that warmer weather is coming, but a 'multi-hazard' weather event looms as Storm Goretti approaches, bringing a yellow snow warning for large areas, expecting up to 20cm of snow in higher regions. Traffic has been affected too, with the A58 Rochester Road blocked and the A57 Snake Pass just about passable. Schools like Hollingworth Academy and several others across the region are closed for the day, with a promise to update parents on reopening once issues are resolved. Stay warm and safe out there!
