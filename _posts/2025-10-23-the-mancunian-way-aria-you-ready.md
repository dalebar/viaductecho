Greater Manchester is shaking things up with plans for the English National Opera and an Eton project in Oldham, but both face criticism. The Eton Star Academy has sparked debates about its fit for the community, with local leaders split on its benefits for underprivileged youths. Meanwhile, the ENO is making a fresh start in the region, with productions kicking off at venues like the Lowry. Their latest production, Albert Herring, aims to engage Mancunian audiences. 

In unfortunate news, the organisation behind Manchester Pride has gone into voluntary liquidation, leaving many performers and charities affected. Councillor Bev Craig is hopeful to keep the event alive. Angela Rayner's emotional resignation from Commons raises concerns over tax issues, while safety concerns have led to the evacuation of residents from Rochdale's ‘Seven Sisters’ tower blocks. 

As the city gears up for a future of electric vehicles, there's a challenge in providing enough charging points, especially in areas without off-street parking. Other local updates include stricter parking enforcement around schools and residential developments making headway. 

Lastly, a nostalgic look back recalls the excitement when NASA's Enterprise flew over Manchester in 1983, a moment still cherished by many.
