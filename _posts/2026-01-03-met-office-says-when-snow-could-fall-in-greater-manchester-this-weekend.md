Greater Manchester is in for a freezing weekend with snow flurries and icy conditions expected. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice is active from Sunday afternoon to Monday midday. Saturday morning is frosty but looks to bring some sunshine with temperatures peeping above 0C by 11am, reaching around 3C in Manchester, Trafford, and Wigan, while the rest of the region will be a touch colder. However, with the wind chill, it’ll feel much colder. Come Sunday, after a bright start, snow showers will hit from early afternoon, especially in Bolton, with Wigan seeing sleet. Temperatures will remain low, hovering around 3C in Wigan and 1C in Oldham. After another clear night, temperatures will plummet to as low as -9C in some areas. Monday is likely to see travel disruptions due to icy conditions, with highs only reaching 1C or staying below freezing in some areas like Rochdale and Stockport. Prepare for another chilly night heading into Tuesday!
