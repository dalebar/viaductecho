An old shopping centre in Greater Manchester is set for demolition as part of a £500m urban regeneration project. Manchester City Council purchased Wythenshawe Civic Centre in 2022 and secured a £20m Levelling Up grant to spark the town centre's renewal. The new Culture Hub will be established in the former Co-op store, featuring studio spaces, live performance areas, and changing rooms. While a new transport interchange with a Metrolink stop opened in 2015, the previous bus station has been unused for a decade. In 2025, the government announced a £20m investment over 10 years for the Benchill South and Wythenshawe Central area through the Pride in Place programme. Local resident Shirley Pelmear expressed nostalgia for the Civic Centre's former vibrancy, now overshadowed by pound and charity shops.
