Stalybridge is gearing up for a makeover with plans for a new pedestrian and cycle bridge over the River Tame to link Water Street and Caroline Street, right in the town centre. There's a major £11.1m project underway aiming to revamp the western edge of the town, including new housing and improved roads, all around the train station. Four underused plots have been unlocked to kick-start this regeneration, with a multi-storey car park set to replace lost surface parking. The vision for the Stalybridge West masterplan promises a vibrant area with a mix of homes and local amenities, enhancing access to leisure and cultural activities. Also, a separate £19.9m government funding is earmarked for upgrades to the civic hall, library, and surrounding public spaces. Key areas like Market Street and Armentieres Square will see significant improvements to make them pedestrian-friendly and lively. Local leaders emphasise that these developments are community-driven, aiming to create a welcoming town for future generations. Work starts this month at Old Town Hall Gardens, with phases continuing into 2026, plus plans to enhance the Stalybridge War Memorial are underway.
