Parts of Greater Manchester are bracing for snow and ice, with the Met Office issuing yellow alerts for the area starting at midnight on Thursday, January 1, lasting until midday on Friday, January 2. This comes alongside an amber cold health alert from the UK Health Security Agency covering all of England until January 6. The yellow warning affects southern regions of Greater Manchester, including Trafford, South Manchester, Stockport, Salford, and Tameside, as well as parts of Cheshire. Forecasters expect sleet and snow, potentially bringing 1-5 cm in some areas, along with icy conditions on untreated roads and surfaces. Travel disruptions may occur for both road and rail journeys. Although the weather looks brighter and drier over the weekend, with temperatures around 6C on New Year’s Day, severe frosts and icy conditions are anticipated overnight. Stay safe out there!
