Kevin Brooks, 44, from Wythenshawe, has shared how his dream life in Thailand has turned into a nightmare. He moved there two years ago to be close to his mum and stepdad, but after his stepdad lost his job, they’re now living in a cramped flat with no space for Kevin. Left without income or a stable place to sleep, he’s been roughing it or spending nights in his car. Kevin is pleading for help to raise funds to return to the UK and start fresh, admitting he feels "stranded" and his health is suffering. Initially enamoured with Thailand’s beauty and culture, everything went downhill fast. Now, he faces uncertainty about his next meal or shelter, expressing a strong desire to return home, even if it means starting off homeless in the UK. Despite reaching out to the British Embassy and friends for assistance, he’s still stuck. He’s set up a GoFundMe to seek aid, hoping to reclaim some stability in his life.
