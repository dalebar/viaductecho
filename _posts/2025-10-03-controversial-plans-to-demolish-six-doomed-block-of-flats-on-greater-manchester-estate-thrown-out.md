Plans to demolish six empty flats in Rochdale’s Lower Falinge estate have hit a major snag. Originally, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) aimed to regenerate the area by bulldozing these blocks, which contain 126 homes. However, local campaigners from the ‘Save Lower Falinge’ group challenged the plan, leading to a legal victory that halted demolition efforts. The council has now determined that RBH needs to submit a detailed demolition plan, including environmental impact assessments, before moving forward. The vacant blocks have been empty since 2017, and there's currently no clear redevelopment plan. RBH expressed disappointment with the decision and intends to discuss next steps with the council, maintaining their goal of creating new homes in the area. The saga continues, as it’s unclear if RBH will resubmit for demolition.
