Two cousins, Manzorr Hussain and Imtiaz Ali, have been jailed for decades after grooming and sexually abusing five vulnerable girls in Bury during the late 1990s, with Hussain receiving 30 years and Ali 28 years. In a separate case, burglar Paul Field, 54, was sentenced after breaking into a home and asking if he was in the right place. He received jail time for burglary and criminal damage. A former teacher, Charles Cornelius, was also sentenced to three and a half years for hoarding over 43,000 indecent images of children, alongside disturbing AI-generated material. Lastly, police are on the hunt for Thomas Hunt, the alleged mastermind of a £1.8m drugs racket, following a significant police operation that led to the arrest of several gang members. Hunt is believed to have fled the country before his arrest.
