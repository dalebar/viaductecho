On a warm May evening in 2038, you're trying to get from MediaCity to town as the Metrolink is jammed with 100,000 Manchester United fans. Luckily, a yellow Bee Network Boat is arriving soon, offering a quick journey along the Ship Canal. This innovative transport idea from the architecture firm WW+P suggests boosting Greater Manchester’s transport with waterway options, much like London’s 'UberBoat' and Birmingham’s water taxis. With rising tram and bus usage, they believe reintroducing aquatic transport could alleviate congestion, especially with new housing developments in the area. TfGM is on board too, looking into various transport solutions for the city's future. Martin Richards from WW+P highlights the potential of using the canals, saying it could enhance the city’s livability and reconnect residents with its waterways, a long-overlooked asset.
