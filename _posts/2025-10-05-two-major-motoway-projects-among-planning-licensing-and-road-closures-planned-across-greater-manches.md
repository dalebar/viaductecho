This week in Greater Manchester, two major motorway projects are making waves. A new link road on the M61 is planned alongside a massive 1,450-home development in Bolton, linked to the area's bid for the Ryder Cup in 2035. Called Lee Hall, this development also includes the Park Avenue link road, aimed at easing congestion.

Over at Simister Island, plans for a significant upgrade are progressing, with a construction compound planned to support the reconfiguration of this busy junction.

In other news, Manchester council is stoked about an Â£80m funding boost for four neighbourhoods, ensuring local voices guide how it's spent.

Residents in Stockport have formed the Hazel Grove Greenbelt Action Group, rallying against plans for 300 homes on green space, while Tameside has initiated a crackdown on slum landlords, requiring all HMOs to get planning permission.

Additionally, there are ongoing roadworks affecting various spots, including Greek Street in Stockport for railway bridge work and Chester Road/Talbot Road in Old Trafford for active travel improvements. Plans are also in place for 432 homes in Wigan, integrating a historic 16th-century hall.
