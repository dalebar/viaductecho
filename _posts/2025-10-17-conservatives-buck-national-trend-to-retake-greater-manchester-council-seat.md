The Conservatives are celebrating a significant win in the Broadheath council ward seat in Trafford, with Dr Kaushik Chakraborty reclaiming the position by over 600 votes. He had lost it narrowly in 2024 to Labour's Ulrich Savary, who recently switched to the Lib Dems. The by-election, triggered by the death of Labour councillor Denise Western, saw a commendable voter turnout of nearly 50%. Dr Chakraborty credited his team's hard work for the victory, asserting that national opinion polls don't always reflect local sentiments. Labour candidate Mahvish Masood came in second, while Lib Dem Louise Bird expressed pride in her party's growth, despite finishing third. MP Connor Rand found the outcome disappointing for Labour, suggesting the need for the Government to accelerate changes for the community.
