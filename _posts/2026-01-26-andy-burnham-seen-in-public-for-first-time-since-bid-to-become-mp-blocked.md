Andy Burnham was spotted for the first time since Labour bosses blocked his bid to return to Westminster. The Mayor of Greater Manchester was out with his mum following the announcement of the decision. Burnham had reached out to Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) to seek permission to enter the selection for the Gorton and Denton by-election. However, the NEC, chaired by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, refused, citing concerns over triggering an unnecessary by-election for the mayoralty. They argued it could divert resources from local elections and risk Labour's control of Greater Manchester. The party emphasised Burnham's success as mayor and the importance of focusing resources on urgent issues, like the cost of living crisis, rather than on multiple campaigns.
