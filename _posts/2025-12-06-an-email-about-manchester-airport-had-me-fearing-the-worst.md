Excitement was high for a festive trip to Cologne, but an email from Ryanair raised some alarms. It turned out the email wasn't about cancellations but rather information on airport changes at Manchester Airport, which is undergoing a £1.3 billion transformation. As of now, Ryanair flights continue from Terminal 3, while other airlines operate from Terminal 2. A key adjustment is that Ryanair passengers now use security at Terminal 1 instead of Terminal 3, which caused a little confusion initially. Manchester's new security system allows passengers to keep liquids in their hand luggage—definitely a bonus! Although there were complaints about chilly walks between terminals, it was manageable, and the overall experience at the airport was smooth. After grabbing breakfast, the couple was ready for their flight to Cologne, looking forward to a great time filled with Kölsch and glühwein!
