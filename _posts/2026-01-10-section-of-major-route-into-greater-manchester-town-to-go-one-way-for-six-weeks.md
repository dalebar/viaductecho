Motorists in Bolton, get ready for a month and a half of disruption starting January 12. The A666, Blackburn Road will switch to one-way traffic from A58 Crompton Way to Prospect Street for about six weeks due to resurfacing work. You can still head north, but southbound traffic will be diverted through A58 Crompton Way, Tonge Moor Road, Folds Road, Turton Road, and Kay Street, with some side streets closed. Night closures are planned on Moss Bank Way to Old Road, weekdays from 7pm to 6am, while there’ll be weekend closures from Old Road to Waters Meeting Road, 8am to 6pm. For the final phase from Waters Meeting Road to Prospect Street, closures will run Monday to Friday from 9.30am to 3pm. Diversions will be clearly signposted, and the council’s aware of the inconvenience, aiming to work during quieter times. Thanks for your patience during this essential work!
