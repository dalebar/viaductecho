Cadbury Creme Eggs used to signal Easter’s arrival, but now you can snag them year-round. This year, there's a new contender: the Lotus Biscoff Filled Egg from Cadbury's parent company, Mondelez International, which launched last year and is now hitting supermarket shelves. You can find these eggs at Asda for 70p each or £2.07 for a pack of three, slightly cheaper at Lidl. Morrisons offers them for £3.50, or £2.50 with a More Card. Unlike its predecessor, the Cadbury Dairy Milk Biscoff bar, which had some complaints about lacking flavour, the Biscoff egg is packed with the delicious caramelised spread and bits of biscuit, making it hard to miss the flavour. Weighing 32g, it's lighter than a 40g Creme Egg, but the crunchy texture wrapped in classic Cadbury chocolate has people buzzing on social media. Other stores stocking these treats include Tesco, B&M, Waitrose, Sainsbury's, and more. Plus, there's a new Dairy Milk Biscoff Inclusions egg with bits of Biscoff in the shell, available in various retailers for around £13 to £15.49.
