A massive power cut left over 800 properties in east Manchester without electricity on Monday night (December 29) due to an issue with a high voltage cable. The incident, reported around 10pm in the Openshaw and Clayton areas, affected about 810 homes. Electricity North West dispatched engineers to sort it out, estimating restoration around 12.49am on Tuesday (December 30). They acknowledged the unexpected nature of the outage and reassured residents that power would be restored as quickly and safely as possible. While the estimated times could change based on the situation, they often manage to get many homes back on before these estimates. A long list of postcodes in the area was impacted, including parts of M11 and M12.
