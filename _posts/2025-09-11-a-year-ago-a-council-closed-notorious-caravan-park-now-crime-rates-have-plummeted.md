Bolton Council shut down Crompton Lodge caravan park, which had become notorious for violent crime, including firearms incidents and organised criminal activity. This closure has led to a staggering 76% drop in crime rates in the area over the past year, with anti-social behaviour incidents falling from 99 to just 35. The decision came after serious concerns from local residents and rising violence, culminating in an attack on a council worker. The site had been costing taxpayers over £100,000 annually due to maintenance and security issues. Now, with the park closed, Bolton Council is focused on ensuring the area remains safe, even allowing two families to return under strict conditions. The council is committed to ongoing monitoring and consulting with residents on the park’s future.
