Cllr Mark Roberts, Leader of Stockport Council, shares the borough's plans for 2026, focusing on community growth and improved quality of life. This year, Stockport will see the launch of Stockport 8, a sustainable neighbourhood featuring 435 energy-efficient homes and public spaces, part of the Town Centre West masterplan. The development also includes Stopford Park and St Thomas’ Centre for Living Well, which provides care for individuals transitioning from hospital to home. 

The council’s ambitious 15-year vision aims to introduce 4,000 new homes, a riverside park, secondary school, and health hub. Other projects include revamping Fletcher Street and establishing the Cheadle Eco Business Park for clean economic growth. While the Metrolink isn’t arriving just yet, improvements in walking and cycling routes, along with the new Bee Network buses, are set to enhance mobility. The council emphasizes inclusive growth, ensuring support for vulnerable residents, with continued investments in community health and accessibility. As Stockport thrives, there's a commitment to making it a place where everyone belongs.
