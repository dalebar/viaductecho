Stockport's Lib Dem-led council is set to introduce parking charges at 25 free car parks before Christmas, with fees starting at 50p for an hour and going up to £2.40 for ten hours. While the council claims this will standardise parking options and help fund vital services, opposition councillors, including Labour's Dean Fitzpatrick, are worried about the potential negative impact on local businesses. Fitzpatrick highlighted concerns that new charges might deter residents from visiting local shops, affecting neighbourhood services like chemists and corner shops. The council has received 66 responses to the proposed changes, with 64 against the new fees. Critics, including Labour leader Christine Carrigan, have voiced frustration over the council's handling of the process, citing a lack of transparency and errors. However, the council maintains that implementing these charges is necessary to cover car park maintenance costs and that most of Stockport's car parks already have charges in place.
