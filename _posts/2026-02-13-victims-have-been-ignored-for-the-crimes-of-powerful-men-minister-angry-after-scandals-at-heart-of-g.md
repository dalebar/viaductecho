Labour's Victims’ Minister, Alex Davies-Jones, has expressed concern that victims of sex crimes are being overlooked amidst recent Westminster scandals involving powerful figures like Peter Mandelson and Lord Matthew Doyle. Davies-Jones visited the St Mary’s Sexual Assault Referral Clinic in Manchester to discuss the situation with survivors and staff, highlighting that violence against women and girls is a "national emergency." She voiced frustration over the ongoing neglect of victims, noting that these scandals have only intensified public anger and exhaustion with the current state of affairs. Labour is committed to halving incidents of violence against women and girls within a decade, having released a comprehensive strategy to tackle this issue. No.10 is planning reforms in vetting and appointment processes following these controversies. Both Mandelson and Doyle have apologised for their associations with convicted sex offenders. The Labour Government aims to make significant strides in addressing these deep-rooted problems, even as challenges persist.
