A new 24-hour pilot bus service, the 17, is set to kick off this week, running Thursdays to Saturdays between Rochdale, Castleton, Middleton, and Manchester city centre. This service offers a late-night option, with buses departing every 34 minutes from Rochdale and 42 minutes from Manchester, ensuring those out for a night or working late can travel safely. The initiative was announced by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham as part of the Greater Manchester Strategy, aimed at enhancing local transport and growing the economy by 2030. Local leaders, including Coun Neil Emmott, have long pushed for improved transport connections, and this new service is a significant step in the right direction. Transport Commissioner Vernon Everitt highlighted that the night bus will better connect communities and help local workers, all for a fare of just Â£2.
