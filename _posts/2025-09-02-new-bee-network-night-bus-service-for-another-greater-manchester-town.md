A new 24-hour pilot bus service is kicking off this week, connecting Rochdale, Castleton, and Middleton with Manchester city centre. The 17 bus will run overnight on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, providing a safe ride home for night owls, show-goers, and late-shift workers. Services will run at 34 minutes past the hour from Rochdale and 42 minutes from Manchester. This initiative comes from Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham's plan to enhance local transport as part of the Greater Manchester Strategy, aiming for better connectivity by 2030. Councillor Neil Emmott welcomed the move, highlighting the need for improved transport options for evening outings and late-night workers, while transport commissioner Vernon Everitt emphasised its role in boosting access to local venues—all for just £2.
