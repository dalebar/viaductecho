Some shocking racist graffiti has been discovered in Bowlee Community Park, Middleton. Four different offensive messages, including swastikas and insults directed at Prime Minister Starmer, have appeared in various spots around the park, which has a history as a former RAF barrage balloon centre. Locals are understandably upset and have shared their concerns online. Greater Manchester Police and Rochdale Council are aware of the situation; the council has pledged to remove the graffiti promptly and encourages residents to report any similar incidents. The park is not just a piece of history but also serves the community with sports facilities and pathways.
