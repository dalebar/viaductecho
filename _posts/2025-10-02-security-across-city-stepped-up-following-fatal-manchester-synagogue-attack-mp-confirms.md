Armed police responded quickly after reports of a stabbing, resulting in the unfortunate deaths of two individuals and serious injuries to three more. Mayor Andy Burnham confirmed that emergency services were alerted by witnesses to a suspect in a car. Labour MP Lucy Powell expressed her horror and solidarity with the Manchester Jewish community, calling for action against increasing antisemitism. She emphasized the need for stronger community ties to resist such violence. Graham Stringer, MP for the nearby constituency, echoed the sentiment, stressing the importance of unity and tolerance in Manchester.
