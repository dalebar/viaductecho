Manchester Piccadilly train station is closing for nine days, from February 14 to 22, for a major £8 million upgrade to tracks and signalling. Most train services, especially from the south and east, will be affected, though the concourse will remain open. Only limited westbound services will run from platforms 13 and 14, with many trains terminating at alternative stations like Stockport and Manchester Victoria. This "once-in-a-generation" overhaul aims to replace older infrastructure from the 1980s, improving reliability and reducing future disruptions. Network Rail and Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) are working together to facilitate travel with rail replacement buses and ticket acceptance on local services. Passengers are advised to check travel info and expect longer journey times, with the Bee Network app and websites recommended for planning. Some changes include all Avanti and Cross Country services from the south terminating at Stockport and replaced direct links to Manchester Airport with bus services.
