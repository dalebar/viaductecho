On a hill north of Manchester city centre lies a mini Stonehenge called Barney's Hill, part of a cherished country park on reclaimed quarry land. It's crucial green space in a poorer area, but there's concern it may be lost to developers as the huge Â£4bn Victoria North project unfolds. This ambitious plan aims to build 15,000 homes and add schools, GP surgeries, and parks, but locals fear housing could encroach on Barney's Hill, which offers a vital escape for those living in high-rises. Community leaders, like Sue Bowen, are determined to protect this urban oasis, arguing that any changes should prioritise enhancing, not losing, green space. The council claims public consultation has occurred regarding potential housing development, but locals feel more dialogue is needed about the land's future, urging that it should be improved rather than replaced with homes. They've committed to fighting for the park, emphasising its importance to the community.
