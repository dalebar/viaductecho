Greater Manchester is under an ice warning from the Met Office due to freezing temperatures, lasting until 10am today. With subzero conditions hitting much of the UK, expect disruption on roads, railways, and public transport due to icy patches. After a chilly night, temps are set to rise a bit, reaching highs of 5C today, with some sunny spells. The warning comes before Storm Goretti is set to bring severe weather later this week. In local news, Hollingworth Academy in Milnrow is closed again today due to heating issues linked to the cold snap. Stay tuned for live updates on travel and weather!
