On Christmas Day in 1991, a dog-walker stumbled upon a severed leg in Salford, leading to the grim discovery of additional body parts nearby. The mystery victim, believed to be a white European man aged 40-60, was dismembered, and police initially thought the act was to ease disposal rather than conceal identity. Extensive investigations followed, with over 100 officers interviewing thousands in the area and digging up the site. Despite public appeals and artist impressions, none of the 414 potential identities were confirmed, and many leads turned out to be dead ends. An inquest returned an open verdict, and subsequent discoveries, including a body part during an arson investigation, proved unrelated. In 2014, GMP acknowledged the ongoing mystery, expressing their dedication to solving the case, which remains open. They’ve urged anyone with information to reach out to the cold case unit.
