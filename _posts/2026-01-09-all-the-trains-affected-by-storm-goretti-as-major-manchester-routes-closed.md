Storm Goretti has caused significant disruption to rail services in the UK, particularly affecting major routes around Manchester. While Greater Manchester has been relatively spared, other regions like the West Midlands and Wales faced heavy snowfall and high winds. Key routes, including the Hope Valley line between Manchester and Sheffield, are shut until at least tomorrow, and there's no service between Manchester and Birmingham. Passengers are advised to check their journeys as some lines may remain closed until Saturday.

TransPennine and East Midlands services between Manchester and Sheffield are suspended, with travel options limited and busy trains expected for routes towards Huddersfield and Leeds. Avanti has a reduced timetable and advises against traveling through the Midlands until at least 1pm. CrossCountry services between Manchester and Birmingham are also halted, with ongoing efforts to clear the lines. Meanwhile, Transport for Wales is experiencing widespread disruptions as well. Affected passengers can use their tickets later this week.
