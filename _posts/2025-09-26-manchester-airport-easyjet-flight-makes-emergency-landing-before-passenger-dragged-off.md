A flight from Manchester to Corfu had to make an emergency stop in Milan due to a 'disruptive' passenger. After take-off, the man was reportedly "wobbling" in his seat, prompting a stewardess to intervene. Once landed, police arrived to drag him off the plane, and he was documented on video as he struggled with officers. Another woman, allegedly holding a bottle of vodka, was also escorted off. Passengers mentioned a delay of about 90 minutes on the tarmac before the flight continued to Corfu. An easyJet spokesperson confirmed the diversion was necessary for safety reasons and stressed their commitment to handling such incidents seriously to ensure everyone's wellbeing onboard.
