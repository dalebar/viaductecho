Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, made headlines last week while staff were packing up from the Labour Party conference in Liverpool. He assured his team at the Greater Manchester Combined Authority that he would remain with them for a while, despite rampant speculation about his political aspirations and a desire to return to Westminster. Having previously run for Labour leader and lost, Burnham insists he's happier in Manchester but hasn't completely shut the door on a comeback. He’s drawn attention for his critiques of Keir Starmer’s leadership and for outlining radical ideas for Westminster reforms. Attending events at the Conservative conference, he joked about seeking better reception than at Labour's event. While many in the party acknowledge Burnham's ambitions, there are hurdles ahead, like needing to be an MP to run for leader and solid opposition from party insiders. The potential for change within Labour's National Executive Committee could improve his chances, especially if allies like Lucy Powell rise in ranks. As Labour braces for potential defeats in upcoming elections, speculation around Burnham’s future will likely resurface.
