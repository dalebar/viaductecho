Three men have been arrested during a Britain First rally in Manchester city centre, where the far-right group plans to march. They’re advocating for 'remigration and mass deportations.' While supporters gathered near Piccadilly station since noon, the march hadn’t started by 1.15pm due to police intervention. Meanwhile, counter-demonstrators, including groups like Stand Up To Racism, rallied in Piccadilly Gardens, with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking there earlier. The arrests included offences like breaching a dispersal order and assaulting an emergency worker. One individual was also removed from the area. The police are maintaining a strong presence, including mounted units, and have a 10-hour dispersal order in effect to manage the situation and prevent any anti-social behaviour. Manchester council leader Bev Craig expressed that Britain First isn't welcome in the city and encouraged unity against hate.
