Police in Greater Manchester have noted a troubling rise in anti-Semitism, with children attending Hanukkah celebrations reportedly asking for armed officers due to increasing fears. Chief Sir Stephen Watson described the situation as alarming; it's become the norm for Jewish kids to attend schools under heavy security. Since the Hamas attacks on October 7, the atmosphere for Jewish communities has worsened, with heightened threats and incidents like the recent attacks at the Heaton Park Synagogue and Bondi Beach massacre. The police are now cracking down on inflammatory chants and placards at protests, particularly phrases like "globalise the intifada," stating that they will take action against anyone using them. Watson highlighted that the distress experienced isn't just abstract anymore, as incidents of violence have fostered a real and urgent sense of danger within these communities. He expressed the need for society to reconsider what is tolerated, as what's become commonplace should never be acceptable.
