Scientists at The Christie Hospital in Manchester have found that extreme weather, like heatwaves and floods, poses a growing risk to cancer patients. These folks are particularly vulnerable as such weather can disrupt hospital visits, delay essential treatments, and worsen existing health issues. Dr Robert Chuter stresses that climate change is a health emergency, given that even minor delays in treatment can have serious consequences. 

The study uses ten years of Met Office data to explore how extreme weather affects patients' ability to attend radiotherapy, a crucial aspect of cancer care typically given daily. Researchers aim to compare treatment patterns during extreme weather with normal conditions, looking at missed appointments and hospital stays. This work, funded by The Christie Charity, aims to inform NHS strategies to protect patients during severe weather and highlights the need for better infrastructure. The charity has committed £30m over five years to accelerate research and innovation in Manchester for better cancer treatments.
