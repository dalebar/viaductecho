Tosin Balogun and her two kids faced a tough time commuting from Stretford to Harpurhey for school, making a 65-minute journey by bus after being evicted from their Gorton home. Despite the short distance, the trips were stressful, often starting at 6:30am just to reach school by 8:15am. Due to government rules, they didn’t qualify for free transport, which meant Tosin had to choose between paying for buses or moving her children’s school. With 8,000 kids in temporary accommodation across Greater Manchester, this dilemma isn’t unique. A petition backed by local MPs and charities is calling for free bus passes for children living in temporary housing and more than 30 minutes from school. Manchester Communication Academy even started covering some bus fares after learning about the Baloguns' situation. While Mayor Andy Burnham expressed sympathy, he hasn’t committed to the bus pass change yet. With a current monthly bus fare costing around £40 for families, many find it an unfair burden, prompting the Manchester Evening News to urge action for a fairer solution this Christmas.
