This Saturday in Stockport looks a bit all over the place with partly cloudy skies and on-and-off rain. Expect mild temperatures between 10°C and 16°C, but it’ll feel a tad warmer thanks to high humidity around 75%. The breeze might make it feel chillier with gusts up to 19 mph, so best grab a light jacket and an umbrella before heading out. 

Rain is a certainty, so be cautious if you’re commuting—wet roads can slow things down. Check local transport updates and maybe take it easy on public transport if possible. It might be a great day to stay indoors, hit up local cafes, or explore some indoor spots. Just don’t forget to secure any outdoor items to avoid losing them to the wind!
