Commuters heading into Manchester are facing significant disruptions due to a points failure at Earlestown this morning (October 15). This issue has closed railway lines between Manchester, Liverpool, and Warrington Bank Quay, leading to cancellations and delays during the busy morning rush hour. National Rail has indicated that disruptions will persist until around 09:00. Affected services include Northern, TransPennine Express, and Transport for Wales. To ease the situation, rail replacement buses are being arranged between Huyton and Manchester Oxford Road, as well as between Warrington Bank Quay and Manchester Victoria. Ticket restrictions for alternative routes are also being lifted. For up-to-date info, commuters can join the Traffic and Travel WhatsApp group or follow news on the Manchester Evening News website and via their social media channels.
