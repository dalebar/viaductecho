The Prime Minister praised emergency responders after a terrorist attack outside a Manchester synagogue, calling it an attack to instil fear specifically against Jews. During a visit to Greater Manchester Police HQ, he emphasised the need for unity across all communities in support of Jewish people and condemned anti-Semitism as a collective responsibility. The PM highlighted the swift and professional response of first responders, stating the situation could have been much worse without their efforts. He, along with Sir Keir Starmer, met various emergency service workers, thanking them for their bravery and professionalism. The attack, which occurred on October 2, resulted in two fatalities and several injuries, with the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, being shot dead by police. Both leaders reiterated the importance of solidarity in the wake of such violence and expressed gratitude to those who responded to the incident.
