This weekend in Stockport is shaping up to be a bit of a mixed bag. On Friday, expect a mostly cloudy day with morning rain, hitting a comfy 19°C but dropping to 10°C overnight. Humidity's going to be high at 77%, so grab your umbrella. Saturday looks brighter with no rain, aiming for a high of 20°C and a low of 12°C, which makes it perfect for outdoor fun. Humidity dips to 73% and winds pick up a bit at 17mph. Come Sunday, we're back to partly cloudy skies and a good chance of rain again, with temps reaching 21°C and a low of 17°C. Humidity remains at 77%, and it’ll be breezy with winds at 23mph. 

If you're commuting on Friday, watch for slower traffic due to morning showers, and Saturday should be smooth sailing. Sunday could see delays again with those pesky showers, so keep that in mind. Overall, Saturday’s your best bet for outdoor plans, while Sunday might be better suited for indoors or adaptable activities. Wear layers for comfort in the wind!
