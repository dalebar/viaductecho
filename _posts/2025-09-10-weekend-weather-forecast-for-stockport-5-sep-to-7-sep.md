This weekend in Stockport is looking pretty mixed! Friday kicks off with a cloudy day and morning rain, hitting 19°C and dropping to 10°C. Humidity's high at 77%, so don't forget your brolly. 

On Saturday, the clouds will roll in but no rain, which is fab news! Expect temperatures of 20°C and a low of 12°C, with a slight drop in humidity to 73%. It’s perfect for outdoor plans, as there’s a 0% chance of rain.

Come Sunday, we’re back to partly cloudy skies but with a good chance of rain showers, highs around 21°C and lows of 17°C. Humidity’s up again at 77%, and those winds could get gusty at 23mph, so dress in layers!

A heads up for commuters: expect some slower travel on Friday due to morning rain, Saturday should be smoother, but Sunday could see delays with showers and windy conditions. Enjoy your weekend, and make the most of the dry spells!
