The family of 78-year-old Margaret Ann Crichton, tragically killed in a car park accident at Asda in Shaw, Oldham, before Christmas, have paid heartfelt tribute to her as "a beautiful soul taken from us too soon." An inquest into her death was opened and has since been adjourned. Ms Crichton, a retired midwifery tutor known for her work at the University of Manchester, was struck by a car on December 18 while walking back to her vehicle and later died in hospital from severe injuries. The driver, a 35-year-old man, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving, and a police investigation is underway. Her family expressed their sorrow, stating that she is sadly missed by all who knew her. The inquest will continue at a later date as the investigation proceeds.
