A drugs gang in Manchester and Derbyshire has been jailed for over 33 years combined after exploiting vulnerable individuals to distribute heroin, cocaine, and crack cocaine via a county line operation known as the JJ Line. The group, led by Niall Fisher and Dale O’Sullivan, used homes of vulnerable people for their dealings—a tactic called cuckooing. Between November 2023 and August 2024, they arranged drug deliveries through mass marketing messages sent to users. Their operation was dismantled on 29 August when police executed raids on multiple properties, resulting in the arrest of eight gang members. They all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and received various sentences at Manchester Crown Court. Those jailed include Fisher (10 years, 7 months) and O’Sullivan (7 years, 1 month). Police have warned that such serious penalties reflect the grave impact of these crimes on communities and urged the public to report any suspicious drug activity.
