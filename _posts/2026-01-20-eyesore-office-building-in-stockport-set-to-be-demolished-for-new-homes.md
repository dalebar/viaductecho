Victoria House in Stockport, once an office block, is set for demolition as part of a £1bn regeneration plan for the area. Located near Stockport Market and Merseyway Shopping Centre, the building has fallen into disrepair and even suffered an arson attack in 2023. The council approved plans last July to replace it with a £70m, 20-storey tower block offering 245 new apartments. Demolition is anticipated to start in March 2026 and take around seven weeks. Progressive Living, the project's developer, is excited about revitalising this key part of the town centre, marking a significant milestone after six years of planning.
