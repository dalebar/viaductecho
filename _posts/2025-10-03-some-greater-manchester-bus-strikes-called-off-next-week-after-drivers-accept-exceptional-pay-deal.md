First Bus drivers in Greater Manchester have called off strike action following a generous 20% pay deal, according to Unite the union. The new deal, approved by drivers, will see wages incrementally rise to £18 an hour for weekdays, £19 for Saturdays, and £20 for Sundays by 2026, addressing previous concerns over low pay. This agreement was celebrated by Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, highlighting the power of solidarity among workers.

While First Bus drivers have reached an agreement, industrial action continues for drivers at Metroline and Stagecoach, with strikes planned for the next few weeks. Despite an improved offer from Metroline, which includes an 8.8% pay increase, drivers remain discontent, leading to looming disruption. Transport for Greater Manchester encourages ongoing negotiations to prevent further strikes, urging everyone to stay updated on service statuses before travelling.
