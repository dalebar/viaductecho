The Met Office is predicting continuous heavy rainfall for Greater Manchester this week, with Wednesday looking particularly dreary—it's set to be 'grey and wet' all day. Temperatures will drop, with a maximum of 9°C on Wednesday and 7°C on Thursday. There will be light rain overnight into Thursday, which will remain chilly, especially under cloudy conditions. Expect a mix of rain and even some hill snow later in the week. Friday will likely see more cold and rain, while Saturday could brighten up after a frosty start. However, Sunday may bring back the risk of rain and hill snow. Looks like spring’s a bit far off yet!
