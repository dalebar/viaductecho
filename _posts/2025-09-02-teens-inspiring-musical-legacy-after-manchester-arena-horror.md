A new music access fund, the Eilidh MacLeod Access Fund, has been established in memory of Eilidh MacLeod, a talented 14-year-old bagpiper who lost her life in the Manchester Arena bombing. Run by her namesake charity, Eilidh’s Trust, the fund provides £2,000 annually to support young pipers and drummers under 25, helping to remove financial barriers to music education. Established in 2018, the trust has distributed over £100,000 to various musical initiatives across the UK. Iagan MacNeil from the trust emphasised the importance of accessible music education for personal growth and community building. Eilidh, who was proud of her achievements with her local pipe band and the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland, is remembered for her passion for music, and this fund aims to inspire young musicians in her spirit.
