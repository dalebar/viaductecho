Lisa Conrad, 43, from Stockport, has been facing persistent flooding in her garden for over a decade, attracting ducks and even mushrooms. Living on Ludlow Road, she’s noticed the problem worsening, particularly blaming blocked drains near a community gardening area. Water often pools in her garden and gets dangerously close to her home. Alongside her neighbour, Beth Powell, 48, they’ve offered to collaborate with others to address the drain issues, but they feel their concerns are being largely ignored. Stockport Council acknowledged the situation and is reportedly investigating, stressing that flooding is a complex issue. Lisa expressed her dread whenever rain is forecasted, citing damage to her garden furniture and growing safety concerns due to mushrooms. Beth further commented on the frustration felt by local residents, claiming that at least eight families are impacted and they're overwhelmed by the lack of effective action from the council.
