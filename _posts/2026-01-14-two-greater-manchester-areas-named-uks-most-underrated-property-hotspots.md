Mossley and Stalybridge, both in Tameside, have been spotted as two of the UK's most underrated property hotspots this year. With skyrocketing house prices pushing people out of larger cities, many are now seeking better deals in surrounding areas. Recent data shared by Sell House Fast highlights the top 10 affordable locations that offer great commuting options, local amenities, and a quality lifestyle. 

Mossley, located nine miles east of Manchester, boasts an average house price of £200,244, a 17-minute train ride into the city, and 62% of its nearby schools rated good or outstanding. Stalybridge, just eight miles from Manchester, is similarly attractive with a £240,631 average house price, a quick 12-minute train journey, and 63% rated good schools. Both towns have low crime rates and vibrant local cafés and shops, making them appealing for families and young professionals looking for a new home without the hefty cost.
