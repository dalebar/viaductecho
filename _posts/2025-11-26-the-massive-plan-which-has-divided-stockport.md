Stockport is facing a pivotal moment with the draft Local Plan now up for consultation, aiming for at least 25,000 new homes by 2042, with a hefty target of 50% being affordable. This plan, however, has stirred mixed opinions, particularly regarding the utilisation of green belt land for development. Council leader Mark Roberts highlighted the pressure from the government for higher housing targets, leading to concerns about losing green spaces.

Residents fear that areas like High Lane won't cope with an influx of new homes and added traffic, while others urge for sustainable development that respects local character. Various political groups have weighed in; the Independents and Labour push for infrastructure investments alongside housing, while Conservatives stress the need to protect green areas. The Green Party acknowledges the need for housing but calls for designs that tackle climate issues.

Public consultation is open until December 21, allowing residents to voice their thoughts and concerns that could shape Stockport’s future. It's an important time for the community to engage in determining the balance between development and preserving the borough's charm.
