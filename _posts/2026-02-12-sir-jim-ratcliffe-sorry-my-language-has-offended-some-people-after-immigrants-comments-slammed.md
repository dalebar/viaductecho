Sir Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, has issued an apology following backlash over his comments about immigration, where he suggested the UK had been "colonised" by immigrants. In a Sky News interview, he stressed the need for controlled immigration to support economic growth. Despite his intention to highlight the importance of addressing migration alongside investment in jobs and skills, his remarks stirred criticism, including from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who deemed them "offensive and wrong," and local officials like Andy Burnham and Trafford Council leader Tom Ross, who emphasised Manchester's rich history of diversity and community. They highlighted the contributions of immigrants to the region and called for Ratcliffe's comments to be retracted, stressing the need for unity and welcoming attitudes in the area.
