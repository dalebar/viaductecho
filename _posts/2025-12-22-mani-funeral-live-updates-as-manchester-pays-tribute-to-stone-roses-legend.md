Friends, family, and famous faces will gather to bid farewell to Gary 'Mani' Mounfield, the beloved Stone Roses bassist, who passed away peacefully at 63 on November 20. His funeral will be held at Manchester Cathedral, followed by a private committal service. Mani’s death comes nearly two years after his wife, Imelda, lost her battle with stage four bowel cancer. The couple leaves behind twin sons, Gene and George. Tim Burgess from The Charlatans has expressed that today is “all about Mani,” highlighting the significant loss for the music community. Originally from Crumpsall, Mani's journey began at Xaverian College, leading to his iconic role in the Stone Roses from 1987 until their split in 1996, and later with Primal Scream. In 2011, he helped reunite the Stone Roses. As Manchester mourns a true local legend, his impact on music and fans across the globe is celebrated.
