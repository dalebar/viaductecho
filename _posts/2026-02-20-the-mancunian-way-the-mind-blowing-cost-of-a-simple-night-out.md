Mark Hughes shared his shock over the soaring costs of a night out in Manchester, detailing expenses that added up to over £200 just for a meal and some drinks. His post sparked a lively debate online, with M.E.N. lifestyle editor Dianne Bourne chiming in about her own expensive outings with kids, including a staggering £1,599 quote for a trip to Center Parcs. She expressed her love for her kids but frustration at the financial strain. Meanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on making tough decisions for Manchester United have stirred discussions about his unpopular changes at the club. On the City side, fans are voicing concerns about ticket prices and empty seats at the Etihad. In the vibrant scene, Utopia, a pop-up pub and art installation, aims to unite the community. As the weekend approaches, mild and damp weather is expected in Manchester, and the city centre will be buzzing with a police dispersal order due to planned marches and events.
