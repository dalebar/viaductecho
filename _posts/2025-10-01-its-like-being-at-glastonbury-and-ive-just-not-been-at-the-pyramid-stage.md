Andy Burnham's leadership ambitions have been the hot topic at the Labour Party conference, overshadowing the deputy leadership contest between Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson. Powell, the Manchester Central MP, is vying to replace Angela Rayner and has been actively seeking member support, while Phillipson is seen as the preferred choice of Keir Starmer. Powell dismissed claims that their race reflects a rivalry between Burnham and the Prime Minister as 'sexist.' Meanwhile, Burnham is keeping a low profile, making few appearances and stirring intrigue with his comments on future leadership. He critiqued the government and pushed alternative policies, annoying some party members by not completely ruling out a leadership bid. Powell expressed her commitment to harnessing the talents within the party, including Burnhamâ€™s, and highlighted the disconnect felt by party members. She aims to motivate and engage them as deputy leader to regain control of the narrative and ensure the party is ready for the upcoming challenges.
