Steven Wright, former boss of The Cheshire Window Outlet Ltd, has been found guilty of fraud and breaching disqualification orders after failing to install windows for customers who paid deposits. Despite a previous ban from holding director roles, he set up the company using his wife and a friend as fronts shortly after his disqualification in 2018. Complaints led Stockport Council's trading standards to pursue criminal charges in 2022, but the couple fled to Florida in early 2023, prompting the court to issue arrest warrants. The trial continued in their absence, with the Wrights convicted on 11 September. Louise Wright was found guilty for aiding her husband, while the company itself was also convicted. Mark Tibbot, who initially fled, was arrested and given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to assisting the breaches. Cllr Dan Oliver praised the council's commitment to protecting residents and taking action against dishonest businesses, sending a strong message against fraud.
