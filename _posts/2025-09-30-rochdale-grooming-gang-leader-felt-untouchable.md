A market stallholder named Zahid, who groomed and raped two girls in Rochdale, believed he was "almost untouchable," the court heard. One victim, known as Girl B, was in a children's home and was targeted despite Zahid knowing her situation. Prosecutor Rossano Scamardella KC revealed that two 16-year-olds had complained about Zahid's inappropriate behaviour and comments while he also gave them free and discounted items. Zahid's barrister mentioned that his 2016 conviction caused turmoil in his family life. Interestingly, Zahid has fled the UK on bail before his trial and will be sentenced in his absence.
