Manchester council has lost a key High Court case, allowing Great Jackson Street Estates Ltd (GJSE) to proceed with plans for two 56-storey skyscrapers at the Park Place site. Despite the council’s refusals to demolish existing industrial sheds, GJSE won an appeal, with the judge stating they could carry out the demolition. The firm, part of the Weis Group, aims for a more collaborative relationship with the council after years of setbacks. They highlighted the inconsistency between the council's planning objectives and their previous decisions. With the ruling, GJSE can move ahead with their project, which will deliver over 1,000 flats — including studios, one, two, and three-bedroom apartments, and townhouses — alongside commercial spaces. This development will join Manchester’s growing ‘skyscraper district’ that has seen significant construction in recent years. The council must also cover £80,000 of GJSE's legal costs, and they have accepted the court’s decision.
