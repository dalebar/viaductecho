Salar Henareh, the former manager of Chorlton's Sky Lounge, has been fined £10,000 after ignoring licensing laws and causing a number of complaints. The café and restaurant, opened in autumn 2023, faced investigations from Manchester City Council for issues like noise complaints and selling alcohol outside allowed hours. Despite receiving good reviews, Henareh didn't comply with legal requirements, including providing CCTV footage, leading to the revocation of the venue's licence in January 2024. Further violations continued during his appeal, including illegal shisha sales and more breaches of alcohol sale regulations. After missing a hearing at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, he was found guilty in absentia of 12 licensing offences and fined. He also received additional fines for health law breaches and was ordered to pay costs, alongside a five-year ban from managing licensed premises. Councillor Lee-Ann Igbon emphasised the importance of sticking to licensing rules to ensure public safety and praised the council officers for their efforts in addressing the issue.
