Julian Bell, an 18-year-old from Longsight, received half a million pounds in compensation after being left paralysed from a motorbike accident. Instead of using the money to escape his violent surroundings, he sought revenge for his brother Orville, who was murdered in a shooting in 1996. Bell formed the Longsight Crew, using his cash to arm himself and build a fearsome gang, earning the nickname 'Godfather of Death'. Engaging in a bloody power struggle with rival gangs, he was jailed for threatening a witness but returned to crime after his release. 

Eventually, he was thrown back behind bars for 20 years for drug trafficking and weapons possession. Once released, he attempted to re-establish his drug empire, moving operations to affluent areas like Cheltenham and Gloucester with a network run from prison by an accomplice. In 2018, a multi-agency investigation led to multiple arrests, including Bell, who was sentenced to over ten years for drug offences. His reign of terror had finally come to a close, ending his criminal activities for good.
