The Official Monster Raving Loony Party has announced Sir Oink-a-Lot as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election, following former MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation for health reasons. With the catchy slogan "Think Big, Vote Pig", the party is all about adding a bit of fun to elections, claiming to "bring home the bacon" and "ham it up" in local politics. This party, known for its quirky candidates since 1983 like R. U. Seerius and Mad Cow-Girl, continues to aim for a light-hearted approach in what can often be dull election races. A complete list of candidates for the by-election is available online.
