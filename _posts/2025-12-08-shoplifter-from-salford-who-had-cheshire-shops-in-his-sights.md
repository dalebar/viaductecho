Edward Stokes, a 39-year-old from Salford, has been sentenced to 15 months in prison for shoplifting over £5,000 worth of goods from various stores in Cheshire, including Waitrose, Next, and Wells Pharmacy. The offences took place between July and October 2024, prompting a police investigation that identified him as the culprit. Stokes pleaded guilty to nine counts of theft. Following his sentencing, PC Emily Mackintosh from the Macclesfield Neighbourhood Policing Team emphasised their commitment to tackling retail crime, especially as the Christmas shopping season approaches. She encouraged residents to report any concerns about shoplifting to their local police, reinforcing the importance of community vigilance in supporting retailers.
