The Environment Agency has kicked off an investigation after a large number of small plastic pellets, known as bio-beads, were discovered near a river in Greater Manchester. These pellets are used in sewage treatment to help break down organic waste but pose a serious risk to wildlife as they can be mistaken for food. Caroline Brice, 70, first noticed them at Springwater Park and expressed concern about the negative impact on local conservation efforts. While many beads have since disappeared from the park, thousands were still spotted near Salford Quays by BBC Radio Manchester. The Environment Agency is urging anyone aware of further contamination in other rivers to get in touch.
