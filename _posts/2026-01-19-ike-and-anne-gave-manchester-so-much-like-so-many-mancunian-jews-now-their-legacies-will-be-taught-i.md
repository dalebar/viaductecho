After the tragic Heaton Park synagogue attack, Greater Manchester will introduce a programme called ‘Sanctuary Through Story’ in schools, aimed at teaching kids about antisemitism and the value of respect. Students in Manchester, Bury, and Salford will hear tales from Holocaust survivors, like Ike Alterman, who endured four concentration camps and later made a name in Manchester as a jeweller, and Anne Super, who survived as a hidden child and later thrived as a businesswoman in Cheetham Hill. The initiative, prompted by the attack that claimed two lives, focuses on fostering kindness and unity in the community. City leaders emphasise the importance of remembering history to combat hate, with resources for schools available from January 26. It's all about turning the pain of the past into lessons for a more compassionate future.
