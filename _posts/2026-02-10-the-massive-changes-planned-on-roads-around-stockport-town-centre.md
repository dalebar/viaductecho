Stockport is gearing up for significant upgrades to its walking and cycling routes through the Stockport town centre west active travel scheme. This plan aims to improve connections between the railway station, transport interchange, and the wider town centre, linking areas like Edgeley and Heaton Mersey. Key features include new shared paths, better crossings, and traffic calming measures. Proposed changes involve segregated routes on Travis Brow, enhancements along the River Mersey, and improved access through Hollywood Park. An active travel corridor is planned for Edgeley, with dedicated cycleways and upgraded junctions. Councillors recently expressed their support for these developments, highlighting their benefits for both pedestrians and cyclists. The aim is to create a more accessible and cyclist-friendly environment in the area, complementing ongoing regeneration efforts in Stockport.
