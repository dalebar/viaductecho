Stockport is gearing up for some exciting changes to its roads with the proposed Stockport Town Centre West active travel scheme. This initiative aims to enhance walking and cycling links between the railway station, transport interchange, and the town centre, linking up with areas like Edgeley, Cale Green, Davenport, Adswood, and Heaton Mersey. With new homes and businesses emerging in the town centre, council discussions highlighted the limited car parking at recent developments, pushing for better active travel options. Proposed upgrades include shared cycling and walking paths, traffic calming measures, and improved crossings at key locations like Heaton Lane roundabout and Hollywood Park. Key features include segregated routes along Travis Brow and a special CYCLOPS junction for cyclists at Adswood Road. Local councillors have thrown their support behind the scheme, seeing it as a significant boost for residents and a step toward making Stockport more pedestrian and cyclist-friendly. Overall, it's a promising move towards a greener and more accessible town!
