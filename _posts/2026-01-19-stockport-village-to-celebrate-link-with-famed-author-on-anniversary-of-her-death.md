In 2026, a Stockport village is set to celebrate its connection to crime novelist Agatha Christie, marking 50 years since her death. Christie often visited her sister Margaret, who lived at Abney Hall in Cheadle, and many of her works were inspired by the hall. To honour her legacy, Cheadle Civic Society has planned various free events, including the unveiling of an information board at Abney Hall, a book club led by crime writer Kate Ellis, and a local history walking tour highlighting Christie's ties to the village. A special guest ale called "Who Dunnit" will also be served at local pubs. Additionally, Cheadle Library will host creative writing events, and there’ll be a talk on Christie's legacy featuring crime writers Martin Edwards and Kate Ellis. Activities will take place throughout the year, with exact dates and details available on the Cheadle Civic Society's Facebook page. The aim is to raise awareness of Christie's influence on the village and celebrate her remarkable literary contributions.
