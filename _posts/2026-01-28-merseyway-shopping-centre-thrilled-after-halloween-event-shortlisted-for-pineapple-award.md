The Festival of Pineapples runs from 24-26 February, celebrating urban spaces and enhancing community life. Marking its eighth year, the event features a free Trick or Treat celebration at Merseyway Shopping Centre, now a beloved Halloween tradition in Stockport. In 2025, they introduced 'Merseyday of the Dead' as a fresh theme. Inspired by the pineapple, a symbol of prosperity, this year's awards include 129 projects over 20 categories, with two nominees from Stockport: 'Merseyday of the Dead' in the Events category and Stockroom in the Community Space category. Shortlisted projects will present online during the festival, with winners announced on 22 April at a ceremony in Trinity Buoy Wharf, London. Each team has 10 minutes for their pitch, followed by questions from the judges.
