Concerns are growing for missing 60-year-old Anthony from Trafford. He was last spotted at 4.10pm on December 2 in Stretford, and Greater Manchester Police are increasingly worried about his welfare. Anthony is white, of average height with a slim build, and has mid-length white hair. He was wearing a black coat, a beige bobble hat, blue denim jeans, and black-and-white trainers. A photo of him was shared on social media, and he remains missing as of Wednesday morning. If anyone sees Anthony or has any information, they're encouraged to contact GMP by calling 101 or 999 and quoting log number 2395 from December 2, 2025.
