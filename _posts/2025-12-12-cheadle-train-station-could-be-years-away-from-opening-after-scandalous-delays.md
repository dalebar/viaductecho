The planned single-platform train station in Cheadle is facing significant delays, with Cheadle MP Tom Morrison expressing frustration over the situation. Initially expected to open in 2025, the project, which has £13.9m in funding and planning permission, may now not begin construction until 2028 or 2029. Morrison has urged the Department for Transport (DfT) to expedite the project, which he believes is fully funded and ready to go. Local authorities, including Stockport Council, are also advocating for the station, seeing its potential to boost local employment and connectivity. Transport for Greater Manchester acknowledges community concerns and is working with stakeholders to resolve timetable issues that are causing the hold-up. The station, to be located north of Cheadle High Street, is expected to significantly enhance access to jobs and economic growth in the area.
