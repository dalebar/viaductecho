Police arrested two men linked to a string of gym locker thefts across the UK, focusing on high-value watches. The arrest happened after Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit followed a black SUV from a gym in Manchester city centre into Salford. The vehicle was stopped through a coordinated manoeuvre, and images from a police helicopter confirmed the operation. Both suspects were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit theft and remain in custody for further questioning. One of the men is also wanted by another police force regarding a separate Rolex theft. More details are yet to be disclosed.
