A major emergency services training exercise simulating a plane crash will kick off today at Manchester Airport, using a TUI plane and volunteer actors. Airport officials have reassured the public that there will be no disruption to flights, even though operations will be on a single runway. The exercise, named Operation Icarus, involves Greater Manchester Police, Fire and Rescue Service, and North West Ambulance Service, and will unfold over two days. 

From around noon today, the public can observe the drill for about an hour, during which the plane will be 'evacuated' after a simulated landing incident. The exercise will also include the airport's firefighting training simulator, mimicking a Boeing 747. On Thursday, the focus will shift to aftermath emergency planning. Rad Taylor, the Airport Operations Director, emphasised that while major aviation incidents are rare, ensuring passenger safety is crucial, and this exercise aims to prepare responders for any eventuality.
