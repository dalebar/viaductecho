Police in Oldham are investigating a series of violent incidents following three stabbings and assaults in Chadderton and Coldhurst. On February 12, a 26-year-old man was left with potentially life-changing injuries from a slash wound to his leg, while a 21-year-old man suffered stab wounds in a B&M car park, with injuries believed to be non-life-threatening. Shortly after, another man was attacked outside a takeaway but is in stable condition. A 21-year-old has been arrested for one of the stabbings, but no arrests have been made in connection with the other two incidents. Local councillor Abdul Jabbar expressed surprise at the violence in a primarily peaceful community. A Section 60 order has been put in place to allow police to conduct stop-and-searches, and Detective Sergeant Jennifer O’Brien urged anyone with information to come forward. She reassured the community that investigations are ongoing and increased police presence is expected to alleviate fears.
