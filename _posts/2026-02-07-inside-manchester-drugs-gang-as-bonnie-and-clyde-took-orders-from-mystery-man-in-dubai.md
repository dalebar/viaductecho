A police investigation into a Manchester-based drugs gang has revealed a major operation directed by a kingpin in Dubai, nicknamed 'Hamas' or 'Sinwar'. Known couriers, referred to as Bonnie and Clyde, included Michael Creag and Mala Patel, who were tracked over several months transporting drugs across the UK. The operation's extent became clear when police uncovered the supply of 46 kilos of cocaine, 4 kilos of heroin, and 30 kilos of cannabis, alongside the seizure of over £50,000 in cash and multiple mobile phones using encrypted communication. Key gang members, including David Austin and Carrie Anderson, were identified as key players in the drug distribution network. After multiple arrests, including Creag and Patel during a delivery attempt, the gang members received substantial prison sentences ranging from four to 13 years. GMP's Detective Sergeant Richard McCorry praised the team's effort in dismantling the sophisticated network, sending a clear message against organised crime: they will be caught and brought to justice.
