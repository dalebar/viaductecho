Andrew Gwynne has stepped down as Denton’s MP after 21 years, a decision many locals deem overdue, mainly following the ‘Trigger Me Timbers’ scandal that saw his suspension from the Labour Party. This scandal involved leaked WhatsApp conversations revealing inappropriate comments about elderly people and antisemitic remarks, triggering protests from community members who felt betrayed. Residents expressed a desire for new leadership, with mixed feelings about potential replacement Andy Burnham, the current Greater Manchester Mayor. While some would welcome him, others suggested a local candidate might be better suited to represent Denton’s interests. In his resignation statement, Gwynne reflected on his time in office, acknowledging his mistakes and thanking constituents for their support despite his struggles with ill health. The announcement signals the start of a by-election to fill his seat, leaving a community eager for fresh representation after a tumultuous year in politics.
