Manchester Airport had to close one of its runways for two hours today due to a small pothole, about the size of a mobile phone, spotted by staff around 2pm. Thankfully, it didn’t disrupt services much since flights were quickly diverted to the second runway, which was free as it's typically a quiet January period. An EasyJet flight had to do a go-around but landed safely on Runway 2. Other flights were largely unaffected, apart from some delays caused by poor weather elsewhere. By 4pm, the pothole was fixed, and flights resumed on Runway 1. A spokesperson reassured that the minor defect's repair didn't impact the overall flight schedule. The second runway, opened in 2001 for £172m, proved to be a handy backup.
