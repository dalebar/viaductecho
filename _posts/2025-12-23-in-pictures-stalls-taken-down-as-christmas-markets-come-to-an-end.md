Normal services are bouncing back in Manchester as the Christmas Markets wrap up after their seven-week run. The festive stalls, which have been a city staple since 1998, got dismantled on December 23. This year’s markets featured over 270 stalls spread across ten locations, including popular spots like St Ann's Square and Piccadilly Gardens. Albert Square welcomed back 'A Taste of Christmas', showcasing a mini market filled with food, drinks, and crafts.

Even though the main markets have ended, some attractions will stick around a bit longer—like the giant Ferris wheel and ice rink, which will be open until January 4. Feel free to check out our photo gallery for a glimpse of the stalls being taken down!
