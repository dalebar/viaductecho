Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, have both been sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of planning a mass murder targeting the Jewish community in Manchester, inspired by Islamic State. The two were sentenced at Preston Crown Court to serve a minimum of 37 and 26 years respectively. They were found guilty of preparing terrorist acts, including arranging to acquire firearms and conducting reconnaissance for an attack that could have been among the deadliest in UK history. Saadaoui was identified as the ringleader, while Hussein actively supported the plot. A third brother, Bilel Saadaoui, 36, was also convicted of failing to report the plans and sentenced to six years. The operation was thwarted by an undercover operative labelled 'Farouk,' who posed as a supporter to gather evidence. The case raised significant concerns within the Jewish community and highlighted ongoing efforts by law enforcement to prevent such acts of terrorism. The judge noted the potential devastation had the attack been carried out, emphasising the clear intent and planning involved. Counter Terrorism Policing expressed gratitude to all involved in the case for their commitment to public safety.
