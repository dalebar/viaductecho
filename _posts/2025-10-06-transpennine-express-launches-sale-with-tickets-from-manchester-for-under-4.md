TransPennine Express is offering a 25% discount on selected Advance Purchase tickets, with fares from Manchester starting at just £3.70. The sale runs from today, October 6, until 12pm on Friday, October 24, for travel until October 31. It covers 100,000 tickets on popular routes such as Manchester to Liverpool and Leeds to York. Discounts are available online, via the mobile app, and at ticket offices, but tickets must be booked in advance and won't be sold on the day of travel.
