The ticket prices for Manchester Village Pride, returning this August, have just been announced. Organised by the newly formed Manchester Village Pride CIC, it aims to create an inclusive celebration after the collapse of Manchester Pride Events Ltd last year. The four-day event will run from 28-31 August, featuring the parade, Village party, and vigil. Early Bird tickets go on sale at 10am on 5 February for £25 (plus £2.75 booking fee) for the weekend, with general tickets at £30, and family passes costing £60. Individual day tickets are priced at £20, while family day tickets are £40. The CIC, backed by local businesses, the City Council, and LGBTQ+ groups, will use profits to support community charities. Board member Carl Austin-Behan highlighted the opportunity to rebuild trust within the community following the previous organisation's financial issues, with over £70,000 still owed to artists from last year's festival. Excitement's building for this fresh start for Pride in the Village!
