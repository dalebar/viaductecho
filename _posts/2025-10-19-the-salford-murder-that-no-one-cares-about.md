Tanyaradzwa Matera, known as Julius, was a beloved figure in Eccles who faced significant hardships while waiting for residency status after moving to the UK from Zimbabwe in 2001. Despite struggling with poor eyesight and relying on food vouchers, his family remembered him as a joyful, friendly man who engaged actively in his community. Tragically, Julius was murdered on October 13/14, 2023, in a violent incident linked to a social gathering in Salford. He was found deceased weeks later, hidden in dense foliage. Police believe his death involved a dispute over a bottle of cider, and three suspects have been arrested but released under investigation. Investigators are facing challenges, as witnesses may fear retaliation or be reluctant to speak out. A Â£50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to a conviction. His sister, June, expressed heartbreak over the situation, hoping for justice for Julius. The investigation remains ongoing, as community support is crucial for finding his killer. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police.
