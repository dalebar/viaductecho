Manchester Piccadilly is set to partially close for nine days in February 2026 for major upgrades. From the 14th to the 22nd, platforms one to 12 will be shut for essential track and signalling repairs, while platforms 13 and 14 will have limited westbound services. No services will be stopping at Piccadilly from the south and east, with alternatives terminating at nearby stations like Stockport. Network Rail is investing £7.9 million into renewing the Piccadilly corridor, which is vital for around 400,000 annual train journeys. The upgrades include replacing railway sleepers, points, and cabling, aiming to enhance service reliability. Rebecca Rathore from Network Rail stressed the importance of planning journeys in advance due to expected busyness during this period. They’ve collaborated with train operators and local authorities to ensure minimal disruption. Your patience during this time is appreciated!
