Stockport's looking at a cloudy and rainy week ahead, with autumn temperatures sticking around but some weather disruptions due to the rain and breezy winds. Monday kicks off with rain and high humidity, reaching about 16°C. Tuesday brings a similar vibe but might clear up a bit later on. By Wednesday, conditions improve with partly cloudy skies and a pleasant 19°C max. Thursday cools slightly before Friday turns rainy again, hitting 22°C. Saturday drops further to around 14°C with more rain, while Sunday will be chillier, peaking at just 11°C with early showers.

Expect much more up-and-down weather compared to the calm spells before. If you’re commuting, brace for wet roads, especially on Monday, Saturday, and Sunday. For weekend plans, it’s probably best to keep things indoors or flexible, especially on Sunday when it could get really wild. Remember to take your waterproofs if you’re out and about, just in case!
