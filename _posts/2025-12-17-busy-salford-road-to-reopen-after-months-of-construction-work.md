Frederick Road in Salford is reopening this Thursday after months of closure due to construction on the Salford Rise project, part of the £2.5bn Salford Crescent regeneration. The road was shut on July 12 for work on an elevated walkway aimed at improving connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists. The reopening is ahead of schedule, with plans for the project to be completed by summer 2026, promising high-quality green spaces and better access for active travel. The wider regeneration aims to create 3,000 new homes and enhance spaces for research and business. Additionally, a new phase of development near Adelphi Street and Peru Street is set to be approved, which includes various residential apartments.
