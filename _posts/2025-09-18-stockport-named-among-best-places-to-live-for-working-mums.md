Stockport has been ranked as one of the best places in England for working mums, landing at ninth place. A study by CoworkingCafe looked at key factors like income, childcare, and women's employment. Stockport shines in childcare availability, with only two children per place and rates averaging £5.30 an hour. It also boasts solid GP coverage and a median female income of £33,200, which complements an impressive 71.8% employment rate for women. The town is praised for balancing work and family life, making it easier for mums to juggle responsibilities. Although Lancaster topped the list, Stockport holds its ground as the sole Greater Manchester area in the top ten. CoworkingCafe highlighted that access to quality services significantly aids in managing work-life balance.
