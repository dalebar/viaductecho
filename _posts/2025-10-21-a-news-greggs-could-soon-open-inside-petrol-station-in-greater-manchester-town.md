A new Greggs could be headed to Littleborough, replacing a car wash next to a petrol station on Church Road. Plans include a 70 sqm ‘Food to Go’ pod with a sales area, serving station, and storage for baking, addressing the area's need for quick food options. There'll also be five new parking bays to tackle existing parking issues. The proposal, submitted by Motor Fuel Group, aims to create eight new jobs—four full-time and four part-time—providing flexible work opportunities for locals. If Rochdale council gives the nod, this will add to the chain’s extensive presence across the UK. Sounds like a proper win for the community!
