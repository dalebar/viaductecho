Professor Caroline Dive's journey into cancer research was deeply personal, stemming from her father's battle with cancer of unknown primary (CUP). As Director of the Cancer Research UK National Biomarker Centre at The Christie in Manchester, she leads important research on blood tests that could detect cancer much earlier than current scans allow. Her work is featured in Channel 4's documentary 'Cancer Detectives: Finding the Cures'. One patient, Lee, diagnosed with CUP, has donated blood samples to aid in developing a new blood test called CUPid, which identifies cancer through fragments of DNA in the bloodstream. This innovative "liquid biopsy" approach shows promise for regular cancer screenings. Prof Dive notes the complexity of cancer DNA and emphasises teamwork at the research hub, collaborating closely with clinicians. Another patient, Damian, is participating in a trial monitoring melanoma recurrence through blood tests. Prof Dive’s goal is to enhance patient outcomes, aiming for cures or improved quality of life while reducing side effects. With the field advancing quickly, she holds hope for significant breakthroughs in cancer detection emerging from Manchester soon.
