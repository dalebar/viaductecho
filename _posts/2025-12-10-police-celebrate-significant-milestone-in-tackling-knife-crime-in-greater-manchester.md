Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are marking three years of Operation Venture, aimed at tackling knife crime. Since its launch, they've made 958 arrests, seized 284 weapons, and confiscated £780,000 in cash. GMP focuses on 'hotspot' areas and works on preventing and addressing the root causes of knife crime. Superintendent Richard Thompson emphasised that knife crime devastates families and communities. The dedicated team has delivered over 37,000 hours of proactive patrolling, resulting in a 10% reduction in knife crime compared to last year, with 61 positive stop-searches daily. GMP relies on community intelligence to tackle these issues effectively and encourages anyone with information to report it via their website or anonymously through Crimestoppers. They stress the importance of community support in their continued efforts to keep Greater Manchester safe. Always call 999 in emergencies.
