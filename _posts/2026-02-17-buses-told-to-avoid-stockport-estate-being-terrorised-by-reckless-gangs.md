Residents in Brinnington, Stockport, are feeling 'terrorised' by groups of kids throwing objects at buses, leading to service diversions over the weekend. The 325 bus, linking Stockport town centre to the housing estate, had to halt operations due to safety concerns, causing locals to rely on taxis to get around. Cllr Christine Carrigan described the behaviour as careless, while others noted that this kind of anti-social activity isn't new to the area. A resident shared that a recent bus driver avoided stopping near a group of teenagers for safety reasons. Although some residents feel uneasy due to the gangs, others believe the area is still a decent place to live. Greater Manchester Police acknowledged the issue, stating that they are actively addressing anti-social behaviour. They highlighted recent efforts, including the arrest of 21 individuals during a three-week initiative. Residents are encouraged to report incidents to help address the concerns in their community.
