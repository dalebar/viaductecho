Following the tragic attack on the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has called for urgent action to address anti-Semitism and extremism in the UK. The incident, which occurred on Yom Kippur, resulted in the deaths of Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, prompting widespread concern among the Jewish community, who had previously warned such violence could occur. Mahmood stressed the need for enhanced security measures at Jewish sites and highlighted the bravery displayed during the attack. She condemned the assailant, Jihad Al-Shamie, who had not been flagged to counter-terrorism services, and noted that the UK's domestic terror threat is becoming more complex. The Home Secretary urged solidarity against hate and violence, asserting that acts against one community affect the entire nation. In response, shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp emphasised that all communities must unite against extremism to foster a safer environment for everyone.
