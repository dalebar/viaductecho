A £1bn plan is in the works to transform Salford’s Regent Retail Park into Greater Manchester’s tallest skyscraper, potentially delivering 3,300 homes, including 660 affordable units—the largest housing project in Salford in 50 years. Developers Henley Investment Management aim to create a vibrant community with open spaces, retail, and health services, alongside a striking tower reaching up to 273 metres. While planning had received a positive recommendation, some local councillors and residents, including MP Rebecca Long-Bailey, have raised concerns about traffic, loss of shops, and the overall impact on the area. HIM is addressing these issues and hopes to resubmit plans for approval soon. They emphasise the community benefits, including a promise to retain existing services and create jobs amidst a housing crisis, with over 5,000 people on Salford's housing register. Amidst opposition—over 460 objections—HIM argues the redevelopment is essential for the future of Regent Park and the local community.
