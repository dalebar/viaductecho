Greater Manchester hospitals are facing serious pressure, frequently moving in and out of the NHS's highest alert level, OPEL 4. This comes as winter brings increased illness, including a rise in flu and norovirus cases. Currently, the region's hospitals are averaging 94.6% bed occupancy, with all acute trusts surpassing 90%. Many patients are stuck in hospitals due to delays in finding suitable post-discharge care. Though some hospitals are coping with high A&E volumes, the situation is becoming difficult. The acting CEO of the Greater Manchester Integrated Care Board, Colin Scales, noted that before Christmas, pressures were manageable, with hospitals around 80% full, but currently, they're under "significant duress." Health leaders are keeping an eye on the situation, especially with a predicted cold snap that could worsen pressures. Overall, while some hospitals have reached OPEL 4 in the past week, the entire region hasn't sustained this level, but ongoing challenges remain.
