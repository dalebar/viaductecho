Andy Burnham has hit back at Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe for his controversial remarks about immigrants, claiming they contradict Manchester's values. Burnham argued that the city has always welcomed people from diverse backgrounds, enhancing its culture and institutions, including United FC. He specifically called Ratcliffe's portrayal of immigrants as a "hostile invading force" inaccurate and inflammatory. Ratcliffe, founder of Ineos, had claimed in an interview that the UK is being "colonised by immigrants" and suggested that major changes are needed concerning welfare and immigration. Burnham countered that the city's NHS workers and many others have significantly contributed to Greater Manchester, urging that criticism should focus on those who've exploited local resources rather than newcomers. He pointed out Ratcliffe's history of making decisions that have upset United fans since his involvement in the club. Burnham’s response reflects a broader call for understanding and inclusivity in Manchester's identity.
