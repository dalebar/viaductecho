Aer Lingus is shifting its Manchester flights to Terminal 2 at Manchester Airport starting September 16. This change is part of the airport's Â£1.3 billion transformation programme, making Terminal 2 the main hub. Terminal 1 is closing, and Terminal 3 is expanding, bringing in new restaurants and shops, like Lego and Joe and The Juice. Now, all Aer Lingus flights from Manchester, including routes to Dublin and Belfast, will operate from the same terminal, providing easier connections for passengers heading to transatlantic locations via Dublin's hub. Notably, preclearance at Dublin Airport allows customers flying to the US to clear customs before arrival, streamlining their journey. Aer Lingus aims to enhance customer comfort and convenience at the newly revamped Terminal 2. Those affected by the changes will be notified directly.
