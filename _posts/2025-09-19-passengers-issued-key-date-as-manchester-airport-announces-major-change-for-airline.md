Manchester Airport is gearing up for more changes as it completes its Â£1.3 billion revamp of Terminal 2. After moving Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus Regional flights to the new terminal, Luxair is making the switch on September 22, and Finnair will join the crew on September 24. Once fully operational, Terminal 2 will handle over 70% of flights, boasting expanded facilities and new shops like Lego, Joe and The Juice, and Pandora. As Terminal 1 gets ready to close for the expansion of Terminal 3, more dining and shopping options are in the pipeline, including a Fever Tree bar and a food court called the Great Northern Market. Passengers will receive updates directly, and airport staff will be available to assist with any changes. Exciting times ahead for travellers at Manchester Airport!
