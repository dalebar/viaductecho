Salford is gearing up to set a nearly £500m budget, aiming to support vital council services without any cuts this year, thanks to a £23m boost from the government. The budget includes a 5.6% increase in 'core spending power' and a focus on ‘sensible socialism’—lifting people out of poverty while creating jobs and homes. However, residents will see a 4.99% rise in council tax, adding about £102 annually for those in band D properties, alongside an average £200 increase in social housing rents. 

The council's plans also involve making over £8m in savings and tapping into £26m of reserves. With a forecasted growth in council tax revenue from new homes, Salford's budget is more sustainable this year. £91m is allocated for capital projects, focusing on regeneration and infrastructure improvements to support the increasing population. Despite some charges rising, the council is optimistic about future growth and tackling local poverty through targeted investment. A vote on the budget will take place on February 25.
