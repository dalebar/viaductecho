Manchester’s Christmas Markets are gearing up, with the Skate Manchester ice rink already open for Halloween festivities at Cathedral Gardens since October 24. There are ten city centre locations this year, offering all the festive favourites like Bratwurst, Yorkshire pudding wraps, and Greek street food. Prices have crept up for some treats: Yorkshire pudding wraps are now £10-£13, and Greek gyros sit around £11, with some items at the Winter Bar seeing slight increases too. Cocktails are a tad cheaper, down to £8.50, while the ever-popular Dutch Mini Pancakes are now £6. Christmas mugs are back, costing a £3.50 deposit, and you can keep them as a souvenir. The main Markets will officially open on November 7 and run until December 22, with a special section at Albert Square featuring a mini market and a giant Ferris wheel, staying open until January 4, 2026. It’s shaping up to be a festive bonanza!
