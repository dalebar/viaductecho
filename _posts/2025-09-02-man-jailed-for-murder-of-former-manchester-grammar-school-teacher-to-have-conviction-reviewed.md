The murder conviction of Benjamin Field, a former church warden, is heading to the Court of Appeal after a review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). Field was sentenced to at least 36 years for the murder of university lecturer Peter Farquhar in 2019. The case centred on allegations that Field drugged Farquhar and manipulated his mind to inherit his estate. The CCRC is now reviewing whether Farquhar was coerced into drinking spiked whisky or did so of his own volition. Previously, Field’s appeals have been rejected, with his last attempt in 2022. Farquhar, a beloved English teacher from Manchester, faced inner turmoil over his sexuality and was noted for his inspiring teaching style. His tragic death in 2015 stemmed from Field’s deceitful actions, which also involved manipulating his neighbour, Ann Moore-Martin. The chilling story has recently been adapted into a BBC drama, "The Sixth Commandment," now on iPlayer.
