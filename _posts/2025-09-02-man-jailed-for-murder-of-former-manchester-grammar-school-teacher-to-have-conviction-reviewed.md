Benjamin Field, a former church warden, is getting his murder conviction reviewed by the Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to at least 36 years for killing university lecturer Peter Farquhar in 2019. Field has been accused of tormenting Farquhar psychologically and physically to inherit his estate, using drugs to manipulate him into thinking he was losing his mind. The Criminal Cases Review Commission has stepped in due to a legal issue about whether Farquhar willingly consumed the spiked whisky. Field's prior attempts to appeal were denied. Farquhar, who taught at Manchester Grammar School and was known for inspiring many students, had a complex life marked by his Christian faith and struggles with his sexuality. His horrific death came in 2015, followed by the passing of Field's other target, Ann Moore-Martin, in 2017. A dramatisation of this chilling story, "The Sixth Commandment," is currently streaming on BBC iPlayer.
