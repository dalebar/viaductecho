Richard Shaw, a former appointee at Bolton Council, went on the run after skipping a court appearance for a £900,000 fraud case. He had been transferring funds from vulnerable benefit claimants' accounts to his own over eight years. Using his insider knowledge, he manipulated the system he helped establish, stealing nearly £900,000 and spending it on luxury items, including two BMWs and home renovations. Caught on the Blackpool promenade just hours later, Shaw was remanded in custody and later admitted his guilt at Bolton Crown Court, receiving a sentence of four years and eight months. The council, which uncovered his fraudulent activities through internal safeguards, has been working closely with Greater Manchester Police to recover the lost funds and ensure victims are compensated. The police continue to investigate his assets in hopes of reclaiming the money. This case highlights the risk of trust in public service roles and the importance of fraud prevention measures as cases like Shaw's, while rare, shake public confidence.
