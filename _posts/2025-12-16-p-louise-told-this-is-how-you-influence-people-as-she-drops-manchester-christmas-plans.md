Paige Louise Williams, the genius behind beauty brand P Louise, launched a heartfelt appeal for Cash for Kids this December after noticing their toy shelves were bare. Understanding the impact of her childhood experiences, she pledged £1 from every sale on her website to the cause and donated some of her own products, like Advent Calendars and pyjamas. This year alone, she raised a whopping £70,000, up from previous contributions of £20,000 in 2023 and £40,000 in 2024. Paige and her team even went on a shopping spree to ensure enough toys were available for the 25,000 children in need, filling their trolleys with a range of gifts. Her effort not only saw a transformation of the Cash for Kids warehouse but also inspired many in the community to contribute. The initiative, which distributes gifts to underprivileged children across the UK, hopes to ensure that no child goes without. Paige’s dedication has touched many hearts, leading to a wave of generous donations, as she emphasises that every little bit helps.
