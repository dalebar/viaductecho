A Tesla showroom in Stockport might be demolished to build new homes. Plans have been submitted to transform the site in Heaton Chapel into ten townhouses and 28 apartments, close to the railway station. The design includes 40 parking spaces for residents and visitors. The council's planning application states it would significantly aid Stockport's housing needs, as the location is well-connected to local services and infrastructure. Out of the proposed homes, around 12 may be priced as 'affordable', but this is pending a viability assessment. Each house will feature private gardens with hedges for boundaries. With about 9,000 people on the social housing list, there's a pressing demand for affordable housing in the area. Stockport council aims to make a decision by April 30.
