Manchester's getting a new inquiry led by Nazir Afzal OBE, focusing on boosting working-class representation in the creative industries. With the city’s rich working-class roots, especially from the Industrial Revolution, it’s been a breeding ground for iconic artists like the Gallagher brothers and Morrissey. This initiative aims to tackle the drop in working-class creatives that Afzal notes, as nearly half of the UK identifies as working class yet remains underrepresented in the sector. Supported by Avis Gilmore and others, the project seeks solutions to what’s called the 'class ceiling', with a symposium set for January 26. Partners like the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Co-op are backing the effort, highlighting the importance of tapping into local talent to enrich the community. There’s an open invite for feedback and participation through focus groups and surveys to ensure all voices are considered.
