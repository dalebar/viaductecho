Butters, a lutino cockatiel from Stockport, went missing after a little mishap when his owner's daughter left the door open. The community quickly rallied to help, with Laura Woods, his owner, sharing posts on Facebook and enlisting friends for a search. In a twist, Butters was located two miles away on Kinross Avenue, where neighbours whistled his favourite tune, "September" by Earth, Wind and Fire, to keep him calm. Laura made her way there, but after an initial scare when he flew away, her partner spotted him again. With the help of a neighbour's ladder, she finally managed to retrieve him from a tree, much to the delight of the gathered crowd. Laura expressed immense gratitude for the community's support during the emotional ordeal, highlighting that for her, Butters is more than just a bird—he's family. Thankfully, Butters is doing well now, with just a few feathers missing. The whole experience brought the community together in a lovely show of kindness and support.
