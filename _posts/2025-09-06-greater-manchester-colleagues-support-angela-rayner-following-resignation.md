Angela Rayner has stepped down as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on her second home. She acknowledged the error, stating she regretted not seeking more tax advice and took full responsibility. Despite a watchdog's conclusion that she had acted with integrity, it was determined she breached the ministerial code. Colleagues from Greater Manchester have shown their support and expressed disappointment over her resignation. Yasmin Qureshi and Lisa Nandy commended her achievements and dedication to workers' rights and social justice. Jim McMahon highlighted her hard work and real-life experience, while Phil Brickell noted her decision to resign was the right call to avoid distracting from the Labour Government's initiatives. He emphasised fair contributions to the tax system and acknowledged Rayner's significant role in amplifying working-class and female voices in Parliament, despite facing media prejudice. Overall, her departure has been met with a mix of sadness and respect from peers.
