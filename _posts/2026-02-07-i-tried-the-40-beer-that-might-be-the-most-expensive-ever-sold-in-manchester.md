My daughter spotted a rather eye-catching bottle at Beermoth bar in Manchester – a dark brown stout called In Credulity, complete with a glossy skull label, priced at a whopping £40.55 for 375ml, making it possibly the priciest beer in the city. After coaxing my editor, I ventured back to give it a whirl, all while chatting with co-owner Scott Davies. He explained that rising import costs post-Brexit and its two-year bourbon barrel aging contributed to the steep price. Despite the cost, beer enthusiasts have been eager to grab a bottle, mainly for the experience of sharing something unique. The flavour? Initially intense, smoky, and treacly, akin to port – definitely not your regular pint. It’s a special, one-off treat, akin to splurging on a designer bag. But if you're after a cheap pint, there are still plenty of affordable options around town! Just a heads up though, if you want to try In Credulity, act fast as it’s nearly sold out!
