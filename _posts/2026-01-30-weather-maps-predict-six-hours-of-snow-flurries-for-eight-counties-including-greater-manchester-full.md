Eight counties in England are gearing up for snow starting early on Friday, January 30, with forecasts showing flakes hitting as early as 3am. WX Charts, using data from Met Desk, indicates heavy snow will mostly affect the north west, especially by 6am, before gradually moving south to the Midlands and eastern coast. Snowfall is expected to last around six hours. Affected areas include Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Norfolk, Nottinghamshire, the West Midlands, and Yorkshire. The West Midlands covers Birmingham, Solihull, Sutton Coldfield, Wolverhampton, and surrounding areas. Looking forward, the weather's set to be damp and breezy, with some wintry showers and icy patches overnight. Next week might warm up a bit, but colder weather could return by mid-February. The BBC Weather team will provide updates on these trends in their Friday outlook.
