Firefighters and the RSPCA were called to Sale Water Park in Trafford to rescue two swans suspected of carrying bird flu. Unfortunately, the swans were humanely euthanised after their recovery. This action follows recent bird deaths at the park, and investigations are underway to confirm the cause, with bird flu being a possible factor. Trafford council noted that such cases are typical for this time of year, as migratory birds can bring the disease from Europe and Asia. The public has been advised that the risk to health is low, but they should avoid feeding birds by hand and keep pets on leads away from the water. Anyone finding a dead wild bird is asked to report it on a government website instead of handling it.
