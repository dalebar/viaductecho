A man in Salford is feeling shaken after his flat's windows were hit by bullets during a targeted shooting on Lissadell Street last night. The incident, which occurred between 8:45 and 9pm on October 6, left seven bullet holes in the property's windows and door, but thankfully, no injuries have been reported. Brian Cooper, 38, was startled to find out it was gunshots, thinking at first it might just be a brick. Locals reported hearing loud bangs, initially believing they were fireworks. The area, known as family-friendly, is now on edge as police investigate, having cordoned off the scene and placed yellow evidence markers where bullet casings were found. Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward, stating extra patrols will be in place to reassure residents.
