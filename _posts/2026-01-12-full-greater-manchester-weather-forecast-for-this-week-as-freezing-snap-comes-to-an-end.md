Greater Manchester's set to feel warmer this week as the cold snap eases off. After last week's freezing temperatures, snowfall, and weather chaos from Storm Goretti, things are looking up. Today, temps will hit about 10C, with a mix of sun and clouds, but expect rain to roll in around lunchtime. Tuesday's forecast indicates more rain, with both light and heavy showers, and highs of about 9C. As the weather shifts, Met Office meteorologist Matthew Lehnert noted that milder Atlantic air is replacing the cold, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to northern regions. While the snow's mostly gone, melting could lead to flooding in some areas, particularly in Scotland, so keep an eye on the flood warnings.
