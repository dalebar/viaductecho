M&S has launched a gluten-free Colin the Caterpillar cake, created at Park Cakes’ factory in Oldham. This new treat quickly grabbed shoppers' attention after its launch last Wednesday. Park Cakes has teamed up with M&S for over 80 years, starting with Eccles Cakes and now producing 85% of its output for M&S. They invested £1.5 million to develop a dedicated production line for the gluten-free cake, ensuring no cross-contamination. Jason Warner from Park Cakes expressed excitement about the collaboration and the challenges faced in perfecting the recipe. Since its release, M&S has already sold over 10,000 cakes and anticipates selling around 150,000 annually, thanks to increased production capacity. M&S Managing Director Alex Freudmann highlighted their commitment to innovation and quality, strengthening relationships with suppliers while catering to the growing demand for gluten-free options. The collaboration showcases British manufacturing at its finest, offering more customers a chance to enjoy a beloved classic.
