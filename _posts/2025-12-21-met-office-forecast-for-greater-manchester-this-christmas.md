If you're dreaming of a white Christmas in Greater Manchester, you might want to brace for disappointment, as forecasts from the Met Office show no snow on the horizon. On the bright side, it looks like we won't have any rain either. Temperatures are set to dip from highs of 11°C on Monday to just 6°C by Christmas Day. The week should stay dry with sunny spells, apart from a couple of cloudy days on Tuesday and Saturday. There’s a bit of rain expected today, easing overnight, leading to a mild start tomorrow. Christmas Eve will be bright but chilly, feeling closer to 3°C due to wind and humidity. Christmas Day will be cold too, with some sunshine peeking through. Boxing Day should stay dry, though it’ll be cloudier. Overall, it looks like a pretty settled week, just a bit on the gloomy side with a chill in the air. Stay snug!
