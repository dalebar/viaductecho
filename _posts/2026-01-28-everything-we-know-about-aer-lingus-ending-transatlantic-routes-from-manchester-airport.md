Aer Lingus has confirmed it will end its transatlantic flights from Manchester Airport by March 31, 2026, with service to New York stopping on February 23. The airline will provide alternative options for impacted customers, including a service from Dublin to Barbados, pending approvals. Flights between Manchester and Ireland will remain unaffected. Manchester Airport noted that other airlines still operate the routes to New York, Orlando, and Barbados. The airline is in talks with staff about job reductions and support for around 200 affected employees. The announcement follows a period of uncertainty regarding Aer Lingus's operations at Manchester.
