The Bishop of Manchester, Dr David Walker, expressed his deep shock and sadness following a stabbing incident outside a synagogue in north Manchester that occurred on October 2. Two people were killed, and the suspect was shot by armed police after allegedly driving a car at members of the public near Heaton Park synagogue. Five others were injured, with three remaining in serious condition. The Bishop called for solidarity and healing, particularly on Yom Kippur, emphasising that acts of violence have no place in the community. He urged Manchester to unite against hate with love, reflecting on the city's resilient spirit following the 2017 arena attack. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles also condemned the act, with Starmer describing it as horrific, especially given its timing on a sacred day. Both leaders praised the swift response of emergency services.
