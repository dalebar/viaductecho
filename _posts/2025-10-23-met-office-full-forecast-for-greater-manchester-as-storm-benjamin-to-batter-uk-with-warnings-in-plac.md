Storm Benjamin is making its way past the UK, with the worst weather expected in France today. The Met Office has issued wind and rain warnings for several areas, especially eastern England, western Wales, and parts of the West Country. Fortunately, Greater Manchester is set to avoid the brunt of the storm, with no warnings for the North West. Expect some light rain early morning, clearing up to sunny intervals by late morning. Overcast skies will return in the afternoon, bringing light showers into the evening. Thursday and Friday will see highs of 11°C and lows around 5°C. A nicer weekend is on the cards, with Saturday promising sunny spells and clear skies at night—perfect for the clocks going back! Sunday will start off sunny but could bring some light rain later on, with temperatures sticking around 10°C. So, keep your brolly handy, and enjoy the weekend!
