Stockport's weather for the week ahead is mainly cloudy with chances of rain. Temperatures will be a bit chilly, hanging just above freezing, and brisk winds will make it feel even colder. 

Monday stays dry with highs of 4°C and strong winds, while Tuesday turns wet with rain showers and temperatures from 3°C to 8°C. Wednesday offers a mix of clouds and a few showers, with temps between 2°C and 7°C. Thursday remains cloudy but with a lower chance of rain, seeing temps of 5°C to 7°C. 

Expect more rain on Friday with highs of 7°C and high humidity, followed by a rainy Saturday, where temps will linger between 3°C and 5°C. The week finishes with some clouds on Sunday but still a chance of showers. 

For commuting, Monday and Thursday are your best bets for dryness. Best to pack an umbrella for the wetter days, especially if you’re out and about this weekend. Indoor plans for Saturday might be wise, but Sunday could allow for some outdoor fun in the mixed weather.
