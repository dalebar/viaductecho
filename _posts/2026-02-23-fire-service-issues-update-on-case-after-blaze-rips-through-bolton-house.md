A fire broke out in a terraced home on Hilden Street, Bolton, around 10:45 am on Sunday, February 22. Firefighters, police, and paramedics quickly responded, spending about three hours battling the flames. One individual was treated for smoke inhalation and minor burns and was taken to hospital. The Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service later identified the cause as electrical but didn’t provide further details. Photos from the scene show the exterior of the property severely damaged, with blackened walls, a missing front window, and debris outside. Fire crews from three local stations used breathing apparatus, hose reels, and a ventilation fan to put out the blaze, making sure the home was safe afterwards.
