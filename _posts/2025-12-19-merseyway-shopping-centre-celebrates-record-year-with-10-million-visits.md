Merseyway shopping centre is celebrating a massive milestone, hitting 10 million visits this year, which indicates growing confidence in the local high street. Foot traffic has surged 40% year on year, thanks to exciting new openings like Stockroom, a library and events space that’s already loaned out 30,000 books and boosted library memberships by 80%. Six new shops, including Sostrene Grene and Cards Direct, have also joined the ranks this year, with more expected in 2026. The centre has hosted vibrant events like the Moon Festival and the largest Morris dance gathering in the UK. Centre Manager Victoria Nichol highlighted their commitment to inclusivity and community engagement, evident in initiatives like the Giving Tree. Cllr Micheala Meikle noted that this progress exemplifies the ongoing transformation in Stockport town centre, showcasing a bright future amid broader economic challenges.
