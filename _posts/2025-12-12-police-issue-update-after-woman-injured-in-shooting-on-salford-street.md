Police in Salford are investigating a shooting that injured a woman in Wally Square last Thursday evening. A gunman reportedly arrived on an electric bike with another man, approached a property, and opened fire, resulting in a minor injury to the woman in her 20s. Three men have been arrested in connection with the incident; two men, aged 24 and 28, were arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and have since been bailed, while a 22-year-old is also suspected of firearm offences and is on bail too. Detective Inspector Paul Costello from Greater Manchester Police has stressed the seriousness of firearms incidents and urged anyone with information or video footage to come forward. Tips can be given by calling 101, using the online Live Chat, or anonymously through Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111.
