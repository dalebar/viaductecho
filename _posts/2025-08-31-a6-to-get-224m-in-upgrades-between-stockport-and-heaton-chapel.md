The A6 between Heaton Chapel and Stockport is getting a £2.24 million upgrade, including new toucan crossings, 20mph zones, and improved walking and cycling routes. Approved by Transport for Greater Manchester's Bee Network Committee, these changes aim to enhance safety and connectivity in Heaton Chapel and are part of a larger £30 million transport funding package across the region. This funding also covers step-free upgrades at stations like Reddish North and enhancements to around 220 bus stops, along with real-time passenger information for a better travel experience.

Additionally, the Bee Network has introduced an 'Express Mode' for faster payments on buses and trams using Apple Pay, eliminating the need for Face ID or unlocking the app each time. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham highlighted that this makes travel more convenient and sets the stage for future travel innovations using iPhones and Apple Watches.
