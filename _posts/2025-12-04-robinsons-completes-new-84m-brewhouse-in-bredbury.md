Robinson's Brewery has wrapped up its new Brewhouse in Bredbury after a hefty £8.4 million investment, taking over two years to complete. The move from the Hillgate site marks a significant shift for the iconic Stockport brewer, aiming for a more modern, flexible, and sustainable operation while tackling logistical issues. Managing director Oliver Robinson highlighted the importance of this change for the brewery's future, despite the challenge of moving after 185 years of history in the town centre. The team has already been busy with test brewing in the new facility, hitting their 500th brew recently. Robinson praised the team's dedication through this transition, ensuring high-quality beer that customers continue to enjoy without noticing a difference.
