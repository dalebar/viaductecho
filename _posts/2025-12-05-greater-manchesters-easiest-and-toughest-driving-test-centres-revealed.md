Greater Manchester's driving test pass rates vary significantly depending on the centre chosen. Last year, the national pass rate was nearly half, with males passing slightly more often than females. Bury is the toughest spot, with a 40% pass rate, while a short trip to Bolton improves the odds to 57%, making it the easiest in the area. Nationally, Wolverhampton had the lowest pass rate at 33%, but Arbroath topped the charts at 79%. Interestingly, the busiest centres can still have high pass rates, like Bolton, which sees 12,000 tests a year. Meanwhile, Bury conducts around 8,000 tests annually yet struggles. For those keen on boosting their chances, checking out quieter centres or nearby alternatives might help, especially using the interactive map to see which centres are above or below the national average.
