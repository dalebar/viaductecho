This weekend's weather in Stockport is a bit of a mixed bag. 

**Friday** is all about the rain, with highs of 6°C and lows of 3°C. You'll want a waterproof jacket because there’s a 100% chance of rain and breezy winds at 24 mph. 

**Saturday** sees things brighten up slightly with partly cloudy skies. Temperatures will rise to 10°C but be prepared for a 68% chance of rain. Winds will ease to 15 mph, but the humidity will still be high at 89%. 

**Sunday** will start with more clouds and some early rain, although it should clear up a bit later. Expect temperatures between 7°C and 10°C, with 45% chance of rain, easing to 14 mph winds. 

For commuters, be cautious on Friday with possible delays due to wet roads. If you're making weekend plans, indoors on Friday might be best, while Saturday and Sunday are better for outdoor activities later in the day. Just remember your weather gear!
