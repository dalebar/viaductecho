Tonight, Greater Manchester is treated to the stunning Wolf Supermoon, shining brightly in the sky. It’s quite the spectacle, especially for stargazers, as the Quadrantid meteor shower is also making an appearance, potentially offering up to 120 shooting stars an hour in the early hours of January 4. 

The Wolf Moon gets its name from the time when wolves were heard howling due to hunger during winter months in North America. This supermoon is the fourth in a series of four, all occurring between October 2025 and January 2026. 

Following a post from Manchester Evening News showcasing some fantastic photos by Fitchett's Photography, local readers have contributed their own stunning snaps of the moon over various locations, including Mam Tor, Middleton, and Smirking Salford. It’s clearly a night to remember, perfect for heading out with your camera or just soaking in the celestial view!
