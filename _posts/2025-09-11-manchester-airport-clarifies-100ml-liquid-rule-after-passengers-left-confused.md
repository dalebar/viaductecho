Manchester Airport has updated passengers about the liquid rules for hand luggage amidst confusion around new scanning technology. The advanced scanners, now being rolled out, allow liquids up to two litres and mean travelers donâ€™t have to remove them or large electronics from bags. Previously, the strict 100ml limit was enforced since 2006 due to security threats.

Though other airports have fully adopted these scans, Manchester is still in the transition phase. Passengers are advised to stick with the 100ml rule since it's unclear which scanners they'll use. There's been mixed feedback from travellers on social media, with some reporting no need for clear bags, while others insisted the 100ml rule remains in place.

A Manchester Airport spokesperson reminded folks to prepare as usual, travelling with liquids no larger than 100ml and to follow instructions at security, where plastic bags will be available if needed.
