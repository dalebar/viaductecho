A rare orange lobster, caught off Oban, Scotland, has been saved from being cooked by Jessica Kay and Paul Murphy, who run Wet & Wild Seafood at Bolton Market. Typically, lobsters are dark, with orange ones being one in 30 million. When Jessica received a 72kg batch of lobsters, the standout orange male was immediately noticed. Normally worth up to £1,000, they chose to rescue him instead. After consulting a friend from Bolton Museum, who confirmed its rarity, they connected with multiple aquariums, ultimately leading to Manchester Sea Life taking him in. Named Pumpkin, he’s now in an isolation tank undergoing treatment. Jessica highlighted the lobster’s vulnerability in the wild due to its bright colour and mentioned the importance of sourcing fish sustainably. Customers were particularly excited about this unique find, marking it as a first for their stall.
