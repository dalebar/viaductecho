Salford's ruling Labour group is facing accusations from the Lib Dems of being "out of touch" over issues like a missing email complaint involving deputy mayor Jack Youd and rising councillor allowances. Despite Labour holding a significant majority with 47 out of 60 council seats, they've been tight-lipped about the criticisms. The Lib Dems, who only have two seats, claim Labour has grown complacent after years without challenge, highlighted by increased councillor pay and attendance concerns. Deputy Mayor Paul Dennett's allowance rose from £75,000 to £98,000, with councillors’ basic pay also increasing, which the Lib Dems voted against. They stress that attendance data is crucial for accountability, but after a previous drop in transparency, the council has not reinstated these figures online. Salford Labour defended their dedication, citing external roles the councillors also handle. With local elections on the horizon, the Lib Dems believe these issues could sway voters, insisting they've consistently raised concerns rather than just politicking.
