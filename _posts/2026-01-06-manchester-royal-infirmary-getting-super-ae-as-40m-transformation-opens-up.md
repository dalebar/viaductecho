Mayor Andy Burnham has applauded the progress on Manchester Royal Infirmary's transformation into a 'super' A&E, part of a £40m project known as 'Project RED'. This ambitious three-year renovation aims to enhance emergency services that have been in place for over 50 years. The first phase includes a new resuscitation area for critically ill patients, with ongoing work to expand various care zones and new operating theatres. Chief Executive Mark Cubbon highlighted the challenges of upgrading facilities while maintaining service, expressing gratitude to staff and patients for their patience. The project's completion is set for Summer 2026, promising five state-of-the-art theatres, including advanced hybrid ones for complex surgeries. During his visit, Burnham praised the investments in the emergency care and noted that the upgrades were designed with input from clinical staff to prioritise patient dignity and care. Overall, it’s a promising step forward for emergency services in Manchester!
