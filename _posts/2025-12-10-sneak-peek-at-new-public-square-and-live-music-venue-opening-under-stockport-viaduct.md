Weaver's Square is set to open beneath Stockport Viaduct, part of the new Weir Mill complex designed to liven up the town centre. The public square will host various events like gigs and parties and feature 10 bars and eateries spilling out onto the square. With 65,000 sq ft of outdoor space, it’ll include four areas, from riverside terraces to peaceful green spots. The Weir Mill project will transform the historic cotton mill into 253 apartments while revamping the surrounding area. Expected completion is spring 2026. Stockport Council's Cllr Micheala Meikle emphasised the importance of creating vibrant neighbourhoods and celebrating local heritage. Capital&Centric’s John Moffat described it as a lively, character-filled space for music, food, and community events. Exciting times lie ahead for Stockport!
