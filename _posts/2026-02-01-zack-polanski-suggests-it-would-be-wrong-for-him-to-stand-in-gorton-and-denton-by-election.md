Zack Polanski from the Green Party has decided not to run in the Gorton and Denton by-election, citing the party's focus on "nurturing local talent." Although originally from Salford, he’s lived in London for about 20 years and believes a local candidate would be a better fit. Polanski mentioned he’s keen to contest a parliamentary seat in London when one becomes available. The Green Party has put forward Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber and Trafford councillor, for the by-election, while Labour selected Angeliki Stogia, a Manchester city councillor. Reform UK’s candidate is Matt Goodwin, and the Liberal Democrats are backing Jackie Pearcey. This by-election was triggered by the resignation of Andrew Gwynne for health reasons. Labour held the seat previously with over half the vote, but shifting public sentiment since 2024 could make things more interesting come voting time.
