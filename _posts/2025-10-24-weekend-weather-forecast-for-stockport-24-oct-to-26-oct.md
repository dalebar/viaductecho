This weekend in Stockport is set to be a mixed bag of weather. Friday kicks off with partly cloudy skies turning to rain, hitting highs around 12°C and lows near 5°C, with gusty winds of 23 mph. Don't forget your umbrella! Saturday will start with morning showers but clear up a bit later, with temperatures peaking at 10°C and dropping to around 5°C. The winds will ease to about 19 mph. Sunday mirrors Friday's vibe—partly cloudy with some rain expected, temperatures from 11°C down to 3°C, and a good chance of showers. 

For those hitting the roads, be careful with wet conditions and ensure your vehicle is prepped for the weather. If you’ve got outdoor plans, try to squeeze them in when the rain eases or consider a cozy indoor alternative to dodge the downpours. Enjoy your weekend, rain or shine!
