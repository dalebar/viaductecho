Today in Stockport, expect a mild day with partly cloudy skies. Temperatures will peak at a comfy 19°C and dip to around 10°C at night. It's a bit humid at 69%, but with just a 7% chance of rain, most of the day should stay dry—perfect for outdoor plans! Winds will be moderate at 17 mph, enough to keep things breezy but not too disruptive for your commute. 

If you're heading out, the roads should be smooth sailing with no major weather troubles. Just keep in mind the wind might affect taller vehicles. A layer or two is a good idea since it starts off cool but warms up nicely. So, grab your light jacket and make the most of this pleasant day! Enjoy the gentle breeze and lovely skies!
