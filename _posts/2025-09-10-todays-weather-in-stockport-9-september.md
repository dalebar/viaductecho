Today in Stockport looks pretty decent! It’s a mild one with partly cloudy skies and temperatures ranging from 10°C in the morning to a comfy 19°C midday. Humidity’s at 69%, so it might feel a tad sticky, but with a low 7% chance of rain, you should be good to go for any outdoor plans. The winds are a moderate 17 mph, just enough to keep things breezy without causing any fuss, especially for high-sided vehicles. 

If you're commuting, expect smooth sailing with dry roads and no weather troubles. It’s a fab day to be outside, so consider getting your errands done or enjoying a stroll. Just remember to wear layers since it’ll warm up nicely but cool off in the evening. Have a lovely day enjoying the weather!
