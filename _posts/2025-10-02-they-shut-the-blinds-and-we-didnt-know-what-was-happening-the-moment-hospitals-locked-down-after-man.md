Following a tragic incident at a Manchester synagogue, several major hospitals in Greater Manchester went on lockdown to ensure safety. Patients at Fairfield General and Royal Oldham hospitals reported heightened security, with staff sealing doors and informing folks that no one could enter or exit. One patient described feeling nervous and confused during the lockdown, which lasted a couple of hours. The hospitals affected included Salford Royal, Fairfield General, and Rochdale Infirmary, but the lockdown was lifted later on. 

Sadly, two people were killed in the incident, and several others remain in serious condition. The Greater Manchester Police have labelled the situation as a major incident, possibly linked to terrorism. NHS Greater Manchester is urging the public to only use A&E for urgent cases and to attend scheduled appointments unless notified otherwise. Mayor Andy Burnham confirmed police were called early in the morning after reports of a stabbing at the synagogue. Updates are ongoing as the situation develops.
