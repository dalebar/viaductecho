On October 2, as the Jewish community observed Yom Kippur, a horrific attack unfolded outside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall. At 9.31am, a car drove into a crowd before the driver, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, exited and began attacking people with a knife. Rabbi Daniel Walker heroically barricaded the synagogue doors. In the chaos, two innocent bystanders were killed and four others injured within minutes before police shot Al-Shamie. The incident is being treated as a terror attack, with several arrests made and increased security at synagogues across Greater Manchester. 

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned rising antisemitism, stating the UK must take action against such hatred. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham praised the emergency services and expressed support for the victims and their families. A book of condolence has been opened at the Central Library for residents to pay their respects. The attack has deeply impacted not just the Jewish community, but the broader Manchester area, emphasising unity against hatred and violence.
