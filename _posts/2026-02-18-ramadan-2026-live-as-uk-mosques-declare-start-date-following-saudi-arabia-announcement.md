Muslims in the region are eagerly awaiting announcements about when Ramadan will begin, following Saudi Arabia's declaration that the new moon was sighted. This led to Ramadan starting on Wednesday, February 18, in Saudi Arabia, but there’s a bit of confusion. The UK’s official astronomers suggest that the crescent might not be visible until February 19, prompting calls from local mosques in Greater Manchester for members to wait for local confirmations. 

The Dar Ul Uloom mosque in Longsight has asked folks to stop phoning in for updates, as they’ll share news on social media. Meanwhile, there’s a communal moonsighting event organised for tonight at Hough End Playing Fields. 

Different countries and communities often begin fasting on various days due to the differences in moon sightings, and some still refer to announcements from Morocco or local UK communities. So, it’s all a bit up in the air, but Ramadan Mubarak to everyone as we all await the final word!
