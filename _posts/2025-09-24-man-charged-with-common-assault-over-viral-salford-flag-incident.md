A 62-year-old man, Anthony Gee from Little Hulton, has been charged with common assault following a viral video that captured an incident in Salford. Greater Manchester Police confirmed he’s been bailed to appear in court in December. The video shows a worker in a high-vis jacket climbing a pole with a British flag, and during the footage, he appears to partially fall from the ladder while a second man stands below.
