Hundreds of folks turned out in Manchester, showing support for the ongoing protests in Iran against its ruling regime. The demonstrations have ramped up recently due to concerns over the struggling economy, resulting in numerous protests and tragic loss of life. 

On January 17, a vibrant crowd gathered at St Peter's Square, waving a giant Iranian flag and marching down Oxford Street and Oxford Road, chanting their solidarity with the Iranian protesters. Many held up flags and placards denouncing the Islamic Republic, making their voices heard outside the Manchester Islamic Centre. The lively protest lasted about two hours, filled with chants and songs, highlighting the community's commitment to the cause.
