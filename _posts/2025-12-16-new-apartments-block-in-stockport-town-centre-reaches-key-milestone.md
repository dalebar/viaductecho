The new Bosden apartment block in Stockport town centre has hit a key milestone with its 'topping out', meaning the final beam is in place. This stylish development features 62 homes and is just one part of the larger Stopford Park project, which will include a total of 442 new homes. The project team celebrated by raising a hat, honouring Stockport's hatting history. Bosden is set to finish first, welcoming residents by March 2026. Stopford Park will also include Lyme, a 16-storey tower with 258 apartments, and Torkington, converting the old Metropolitan Girls' School into 122 additional flats. Developers Cityheart aim to transform the area, creating a vibrant urban community where people can live, work, and socialise. Stockport Council leader, Cllr Mark Roberts, noted that this development represents more than just new housing; it’s a significant step in revitalising Stockport, merging heritage with modern design and adding green spaces like the landscaped Art Park for locals. Exciting times ahead for Stockport!
