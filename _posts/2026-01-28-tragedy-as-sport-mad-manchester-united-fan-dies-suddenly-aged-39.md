The family of Karl Kenyon, a 39-year-old who died suddenly at home in Moston, has shared a heartfelt tribute to him. Known for his love of socialising and being a popular figure in north Manchester's pubs, Karl suffered a seizure on January 4 and tragically could not be saved despite the efforts of paramedics and an air ambulance. His auntie, Stephanie Beaumont, described him as sport mad, a devoted Manchester United fan, and always chill, with a knack for making others feel at ease. Karl had epilepsy since childhood, and the family is still awaiting confirmation of the cause of his death. The loss has left them devastated, and many friends have expressed disbelief at his passing. A balloon release was held in his honour at The Railway pub in Newton Heath, and his funeral is scheduled for February 20 at Blackley Crematorium. In light of this loss, a GoFundMe page has been created to help cover funeral costs, aiming to provide him the send-off he truly deserves.
