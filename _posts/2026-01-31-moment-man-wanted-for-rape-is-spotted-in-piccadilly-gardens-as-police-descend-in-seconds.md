Greater Manchester Police have successfully used live facial recognition technology in Piccadilly Gardens and other busy areas, leading to the arrest of a man wanted for rape and other offences. The 26-year-old was apprehended on January 30 during a deployment that scanned over 40,000 faces, resulting in four arrests overall. The technology, introduced in November, aims to enhance public safety and allow quicker interventions before crimes occur. Police noted that the area is a crime hotspot, prompting the use of this tool. Despite concerns from civil liberties groups about privacy, GMP insists they operate within strict guidelines. They’ve noted that around 40 arrests have been made using LFR, with many leading to charges. Future deployments are planned in Manchester and Stockport to continue enhancing community safety.
