With rising food prices putting pressure on wallets, many are hunting for savings. The newly opened MegaRetailer in Rochdale is a great spot for bargains, no membership required. You’ll find notable deals right at the entrance, like big bags of compost for £3.49. Inside, there are fab finds such as 600ml handwash for £1, large cleaning wipes for under a quid, and decent deals on brands like Heinz and Kellogg's. While some items are cheaper at big supermarkets, MegaRetailer offers substantial savings on popular products. 

It’s perfect for a quick top-up shop with treats, including crisps and chocolates that have become less frequent due to costs. You won’t find fresh produce, but there’s plenty of booze and frozen goods, making it worth a visit if you're in the area. MegaRetailer's open daily, so why not pop in? It's located off Princess Street, Rochdale, OL12 0HA.
