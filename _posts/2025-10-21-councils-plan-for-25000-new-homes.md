Stockport's draft local plan proposes building nearly 9,000 new homes on open farmland, spanning 27 sites outside the current urban area. Mark Roberts, Stockport Council's leader, expressed disappointment in presenting a plan that doesn't meet local desires. A specific site at Hall Moss Lane has plans for 400 homes, with developer Jones Homes considering around 250 houses following a consultation. The draft has sparked protests, particularly as similar plans faced backlash in the region since the 2016 Greater Manchester Spatial Framework. Residents like Bernie Gooch from Bramhall are concerned about increasing traffic issues.
