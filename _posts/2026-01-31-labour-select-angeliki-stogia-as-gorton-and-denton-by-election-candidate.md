Angeliki Stogia is Labour's candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election, announced after former MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation for health reasons. The proud Mancunian, and current Manchester city councillor for Whalley Range, expressed her excitement at the launch event, emphasising unity and her dedication to bettering Manchester. With over a decade of campaigning for housing, transport, and environmental issues, she aims to unite the community against divisive politics. Stogia faces competition from Reform UK’s Matt Goodwin, the Greens’ Hannah Spencer, and local Lib Dem campaigner Jackie Pearcey. In the previous election, Gwynne secured the seat with over half the votes while Reform UK came in second.
