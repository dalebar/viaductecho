Tram services between Manchester and Salford have been suspended due to an overhead line issue. There’s no service running from Pomona to Eccles, and trams from Ashton-under-Lyne will now only go as far as Deansgate-Castlefield. Passengers can switch at Deansgate-Castlefield to reach Cornbrook and Pomona using the Trafford Centre line. Additionally, tram tickets are accepted on local bus services.
