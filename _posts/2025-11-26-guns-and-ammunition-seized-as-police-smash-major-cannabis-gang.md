A major police investigation into a cannabis trafficking gang has led to the seizure of guns and 30kg of cannabis, resulting in the jailing of three men. Hafiz Razaq, the key player, coordinated cannabis supply sourced from Bolton and had a wide customer network in the North West. Over the course of the investigation, spanning from May 2023 to July 2024, police tracked Razaq's movements, including instances of him loading bin bags of cannabis into his car. Deepak Singh and another associate were also implicated, with police discovering firearms and ammunition at Singh's home. Razaq received a nine-year sentence for conspiracy to supply cannabis and previous firearms offences, while Singh was sentenced to six years and four months and Jordan Riddick, a customer from Barrow, got three years and nine months for their roles. The court action took place at Preston Crown Court.
