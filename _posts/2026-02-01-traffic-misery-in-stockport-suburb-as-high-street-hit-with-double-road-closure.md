Traffic in Cheadle village is going to be a bit of a nightmare for another week due to ongoing roadworks and closures. Manchester Road, a key route towards Parrs Wood and Didsbury, has been shut since January 26 and will remain closed until February 4. This closure, initiated by gas company Cadent for a new gas supply, is causing major disruptions, pushing drivers onto the A34 and forcing bus diversions. A spokesperson for Cadent mentioned that the closure at the junction with High Street is necessary for safety. Meanwhile, Stockport Council has also kicked off another set of works on Stockport Road, which started on January 30 and will run nightly from 8pm to 5am for about a week. They’ve planned bus service adjustments to minimise disruption. So, if you’re in the area, best to plan your journey carefully!
