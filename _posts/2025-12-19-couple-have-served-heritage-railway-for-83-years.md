Chandra and Richard, a couple who’ve volunteered for a combined 83 years at the East Lancashire Railway (ELR), share that Christmas is a particularly special time for the charity. The railway, originally built in the 1840s, was shut down for passengers by British Rail in 1972 but has since been maintained by passionate volunteers. Chandra has been at it for 27 years and serves as the station master at Ramsbottom, managing the gift shop and ticket sales too. Richard has held various roles and currently focuses on health and safety, utilising his years of experience.
