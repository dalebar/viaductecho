It's pumpkin picking season round Manchester, and there are loads of fun events to check out with the fam! Reddish Vale Farm is hosting a Halloween Festival from October 4 to 31, featuring pumpkin picking, a spooky express ride, and fun games. Tickets are £17.50 for kids, and each paying child gets a pumpkin. Kenyon Hall Farm is another spot to pick pumpkins starting September 27, with tickets at £2.95 per person, but pumpkins cost extra. 

Cockfields Farm offers themed activities, with tickets at £17.95 for pumpkin picking weekends in October. Nearby, Smithills Open Farm has a pumpkin event, plus other Halloween activities for £6. 

Across Wigan and Warrington, you can find plenty of lesser-known patches like Farmer Bertie's and Bates Farm, with entry often free. Be sure to check out Pye Ash Farm's Pumpkin Maze and Grange Farm's festival. Each spot promises a bit of spooky fun and lots of pumpkins, so gather the kiddos and enjoy the season!
