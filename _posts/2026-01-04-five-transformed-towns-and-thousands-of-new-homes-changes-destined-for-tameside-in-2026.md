Tameside is gearing up for an exciting transformation by 2026 with thousands of new homes and major redevelopments across five town centres. The Godley Green Garden Village, featuring 2,150 homes, green spaces, and retail areas, is a key part of this vision, set for council review in January. Ashton is also undergoing a significant makeover with a £20m investment for a new market canopy and hall renovations to enhance local culture and trading. Stalybridge is revamping public areas and improving access to the Civic Hall and Astley Cheetham Gallery. Denton and Droylsden are also set for upgrades focusing on greener streets and better walkability. The Hyde masterplan aims for a complete overhaul, including a new shopping centre. Hattersley is receiving funding for tailored community improvements. Overall, Tameside's plans emphasise connectivity, community engagement, and sustainable growth to create vibrant, inclusive spaces for residents.
