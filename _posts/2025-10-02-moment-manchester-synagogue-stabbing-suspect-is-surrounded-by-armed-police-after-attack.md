Footage from mobile phones shows armed police surrounding a suspect outside a synagogue in north Manchester on October 2, following an incident where a security guard was reportedly stabbed. This occurred at the Heaton Park synagogue around 9.30am, with firearms officers deployed after a car was driven at people, injuring three others. Greater Manchester Police declared this a suspected terror incident under the UK's PLATO response plan, which addresses armed terrorist attacks. Officers shot the suspect shortly after arriving at the scene. Witnesses shared footage on social media as the police surrounded the area, and the public was advised to stay away. Local hospitals were put on lockdown, and police presence increased at synagogues across Greater Manchester for reassurance. The incident coincided with Yom Kippur, prompting strong reactions, including from Labour MP Christian Wakeford, who expressed concern for the local Jewish community during this difficult time.
