Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) is eyeing up a tram-train route connecting Stockport and Tameside, aiming to upgrade the seldom-used railway line between Stockport and Ashton. Right now, it only operates two trains a week, one to Stalybridge and another to Stockport. The proposed tram-train would link Stockport and Reddish South to the Metrolink network, enhancing public transport options in the area. This move is part of TfGM’s 2040 strategy, which also includes a planned Metrolink extension from East Didsbury to Stockport town centre. Mayor Andy Burnham emphasised the importance of improving transport connections to bolster growth and opportunities for communities, particularly in areas like Denton. The initiative aims to create a more integrated transport network for Greater Manchester's districts, including extending Metrolink to Stockport and beyond.
