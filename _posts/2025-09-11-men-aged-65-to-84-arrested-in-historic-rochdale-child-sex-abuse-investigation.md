Three men have been arrested in Rochdale in connection with historic sexual abuse cases from 2008 to 2010, as part of Operation Exmoor. The suspects, aged 65, 79, and 84, face serious allegations, including child rape and facilitating sexual exploitation. The 79-year-old was taken into custody in Castleton, while the 65-year-old was arrested in Rochdale earlier this week, and the 84-year-old was detained last month. Both the younger men have been released on bail with conditions. 

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) is committed to pursuing justice for victims, collaborating with the Crown Prosecution Service to build strong cases. Assistant Chief Constable Steph Parker emphasised that time shouldn't hinder seeking justice for past abuses. GMP's specialised team has already convicted 32 offenders, reflecting a significant shift in their approach since previous failings. They aim to restore trust amongst survivors and ensure support for victims during this complex process.
