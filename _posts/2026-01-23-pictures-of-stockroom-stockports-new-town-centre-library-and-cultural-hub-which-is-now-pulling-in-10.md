Opened in May 2025, Stockroom has quickly become a bustling cultural hub in Stockport's town centre, attracting about 100,000 visitors each month. This £16 million library is particularly popular with parents, thanks to its fantastic children's section, which features a play area, a buggy park, and creative tables for colouring and drawing. There's also a dedicated parent and child room. Visitors can relax and grab a bite at the café run by Mercardo. Additionally, the library boasts various quiet spaces for reading and working, an upstairs adult section, and convenient book borrowing machines. All in all, Stockroom has established itself as a community favourite.
