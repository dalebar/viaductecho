A north London parking space is up for grabs at just under £300,000, which is more than the average family home in the north of England. Located in Notting Hill, the private garage offers a remote fob-operated electric shutter and brand-new electrics. It’s promoted as a “rare opportunity” for locals and investors, with proximity to Portobello Road and vibrant shops nearby. For perspective, the average house price in Manchester sits around £274,008, meaning this garage could purchase a full home in parts of the north. The listing highlights its potential for parking, storage, or as an investment. With garages in Artesian Village being a rare find, this is seen as a great chance for anyone searching for secure off-street parking in a prime W2 location.
