Stockport and Greater Manchester are standing firm against hate crime, asserting it has no place in their communities. During Greater Manchester Hate Crime Awareness Week (2-8 February), local councils, charities, and businesses are collaborating to raise awareness and support those affected. Cllr Dan Oliver stressed the importance of feeling safe and respected, encouraging unity in challenging prejudice and supporting victims. 

To aid in prevention, there will be information stalls across the area for residents to learn about local support services and resources. The stalls are set for Tuesday at Mottram Street Estate, Wednesday at Adlington Walk, and Friday at Heaton Norris Community Centre. 

Additionally, local authorities are tasked with safeguarding individuals from radicalisation through the Prevent programme, focusing on support over punishment. This initiative aims to create safer communities where everyone can live without fear. For more information, folks can check the Greater Manchester Combined Authority website on hate crime reporting and the Prevent programme.
