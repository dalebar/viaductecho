A police operation called Operation Vulcan in the Derker area of Oldham has led to significant crackdowns on local crime, specifically targeting drug dealers. Over the past six months, police have made 170 arrests, charged 55 individuals, and bailed 86 for further investigation. One notable case involved 24-year-old Paranveer Singh, who was sentenced to four years in jail after drugs were found in his bedroom during a search. He pleaded guilty to supplying ketamine, cocaine, and MDMA. The operation, initiated in March, resulted in raids that uncovered various drug paraphernalia and numerous mobile devices. Detective Inspector Lee Newburn from GMP's Vulcan team highlighted the serious risks posed by Singh's actions and encouraged the community to report any criminal activities.
