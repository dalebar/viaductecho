A former pub in Kearsley, Bolton, has been transformed into a swingers’ club called The New Gatehouse. Previously known as the White Horse, it aims to provide a fully inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. The club features daily themed events including 'Fetish Fridays', 'Party Nights' on Saturdays, and 'Chill and Swing' Sundays. There's no membership fee and they offer a fully-licensed bar. Guests are encouraged to explore, mingle, and enjoy the lively atmosphere while adhering to club rules. Since its opening, local discussions have popped up on Facebook, with mixed reactions from the community. The New Gatehouse invites new visitors to come and experience the unique fun they offer.
