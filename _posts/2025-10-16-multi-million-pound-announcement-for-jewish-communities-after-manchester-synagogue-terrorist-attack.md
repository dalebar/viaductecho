The UK Government is set to allocate up to Â£10 million to bolster security for Jewish communities in response to a recent terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue. This funding aims to enhance safety measures around synagogues and Jewish schools through increased security staff and equipment like CCTV, alarms, and floodlights. The Community Security Trust welcomed this as a vital emergency boost, addressing rising antisemitism, which has reached unprecedented levels in the UK. Following the attack that left two men dead, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak acknowledged the fear faced by Jewish people and vowed to improve their security. A review of antisemitism in the NHS has also been commissioned, led by an independent advisor. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasised that the Jewish community deserves to practice their faith without fear. The Government's commitment to combating antisemitism reflects a broader societal effort to ensure all communities feel safe and secure.
