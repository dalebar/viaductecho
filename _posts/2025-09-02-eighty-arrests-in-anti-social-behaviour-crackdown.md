Eighty people have been arrested in a police operation in Stockport, aimed at addressing issues linked to large groups of youths in balaclavas causing disruption. This comes after the launch of Stockport Interchange in March 2024. Last October, police had to enforce a 48-hour dispersal order in the area to manage the situation. Local shopkeeper Corin Allen mentioned that staff at Sterling Foods often face theft incidents. For more local stories, tune into BBC Radio Manchester or follow them on social media.
