Security has been ramped up across all synagogues in Greater Manchester after a suspected terror attack at the Heaton Park synagogue this morning. A car drove into people outside the synagogue, injuring four, while a security guard was reportedly stabbed. Armed police responded quickly, shooting a suspect, whose condition remains unclear. The incident, which took place during Yom Kippur, is being treated as a terror-related case, although authorities do not believe there is a broader threat at this time. GMP rushed to the scene at around 9:30 am after emergency reports, declaring it a major incident shortly after. The Community Security Trust has expressed gratitude to the police and synagogue security for their swift action during this serious event. Members of the public are advised to steer clear of the area as investigations continue.
