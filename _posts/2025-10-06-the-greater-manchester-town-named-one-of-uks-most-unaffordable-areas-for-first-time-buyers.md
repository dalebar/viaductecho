A town in Greater Manchester has been highlighted as one of the UK's most unaffordable for first-time buyers. New research by Pepper Money shows that saving for a deposit is a real struggle due to high house prices compared to salaries. For instance, in 2025, with an average house price of £269,735 and a median salary of £35,464, a buyer saving 10% of their income would need over 11 years for a 15% deposit. Windsor tops the list, requiring 22 years of saving, with Altrincham and Wilmslow close behind at 21 and 20 years, respectively. These areas are now among the priciest outside London, attracting high earners and making it tough for locals. By contrast, places like Stockport and Manchester need around 10 years, while the likes of Blackpool and St Helens offer much more accessible homeownership routes, with deposits achievable in just six to seven years. So, while property dreams might seem far off for some, there are still pockets of hope around!
