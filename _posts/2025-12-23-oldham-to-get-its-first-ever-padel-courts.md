Oldham's set to welcome its very first padel courts as plans to convert a former warehouse into a sports hall got the green light. Yasir Shabir from Ahmed Bros Cash and Carry is leading the project at 36 Park Road, aiming to turn the 1,300 square metre space into a multi-sport arena with two padel courts, table tennis areas, a badminton court, cricket batting nets, and a café. There'll also be a viewing area and off-street parking for about 25 cars. The project is expected to create local jobs, with three full-time and two part-time positions available. Town planners noted that the site's commercial location means there won't be noise issues for nearby homes, making it an opportunity for some economic growth. The development has three years to kick off before planning permission expires. This centre will be the first in Oldham to offer padel, following the sport's rising popularity in nearby areas like Manchester and Stockport.
