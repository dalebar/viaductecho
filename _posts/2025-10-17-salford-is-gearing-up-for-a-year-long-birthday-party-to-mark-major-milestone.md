In the late 90s, Councillor Jim King proposed merging Manchester and Salford into "Salchester," predicting the growth of tower blocks along the River Irwell. Despite initial ridicule, his vision was spot on as Salford has thrived from Manchester's development over the past 30 years while maintaining its own identity, notably highlighted by The Smiths' famous photo outside Salford Lads Club. Key investments, like the Â£1m purchase of the derelict Salford docklands, led to the creation of Salford Quays and attractions such as the Lowry and MediaCity UK. As Salford marks its centenary in 2026, it will launch "Salford 100," featuring a year of community events to celebrate its past, present, and future. Residents are encouraged to engage in the festivities by sharing their ideas and helping organise events. Mayor Paul Dennett invites everyone to contribute to making this a memorable centenary, showcasing Salford's dynamic spirit and sense of community. For more info, check the Salford 100 website.
