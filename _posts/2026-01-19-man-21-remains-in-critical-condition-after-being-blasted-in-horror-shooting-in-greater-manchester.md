A man in Greater Manchester is in critical but stable condition after being shot in Urmston on January 16. Police responded to reports of the shooting around 8:40pm, where a 21-year-old victim was found with a gunshot wound and taken to hospital. An 18-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and conspiracy after police conducted five early morning raids. They’ve reassured the public there's no wider threat, although patrols have increased in the area. Detective Chief Inspector Justin Bryant emphasised the police's commitment to tackling gun crime, noting a 52% decrease over recent years. He thanked the community for their support and encouraged anyone with information to contact GMP or Crimestoppers.
