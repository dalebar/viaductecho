Victoria House, a long-empty office block on the Wellington Street-Piccadilly roundabout in Stockport, is set for demolition as part of a £1bn regeneration plan. Despite its prime location near Stockport Market and Merseyway Shopping Centre, the building has become derelict and was the target of an arson attack in 2023. In July 2022, plans for a new 20-storey tower block comprising 245 apartments were approved, aiming to enhance this key area of the town. Demolition is scheduled to start in March 2026, with the process expected to take about seven weeks. David Fairclough from Progressive Living expresses excitement about this project, which has been in the works for six years and aims to revamp Stockport's town centre. Meanwhile, local news outlets encourage residents to stay connected for important updates through their newsletters and apps.
