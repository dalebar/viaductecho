Connor Holland, a 30-year-old who spent time in prison for a gangland shooting, ran 300km from London to Salford over four days to prove people can change. He wanted to spend Christmas with loved ones for the first time in nearly a decade. Despite suffering a suspected stress fracture on day one, he pushed through the pain with support from his friends and family, who cheered him on with coffee and snacks. Connor discovered fitness and religion while incarcerated, which helped him turn his life around after his release in April 2024. He now works as a window cleaner and fitness trainer in London. His "rebirth run" aimed to show that second chances are possible. After completing the challenge, he was met with an emotional reunion at Walkden cricket club, where he proudly embraced his family.
