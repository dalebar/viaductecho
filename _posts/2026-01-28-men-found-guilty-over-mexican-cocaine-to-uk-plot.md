Four blokes have been found guilty of a massive plot to smuggle cocaine into Manchester Airport from Mexico. The scheme fell apart when a suitcase with 20kg of the stuff was left behind and discovered by Border Force. The operation involved US couriers arriving in Manchester, picking up suitcases from flights, and then passing them on to local associates, including two Albanian nationals from Liverpool. 

On 11 June 2024, eight suitcases were sent, alongside a previous delivery of 300kg brought in late May. The NCA’s investigation led to arrests, uncovering evidence like a Jaguar car modified for drug smuggling and notebooks detailing cocaine logistics to various UK cities. CCTV footage linked the men to their activities, with one attempting to flee from a police raid. 

Three of the men confessed to drug charges, while the fourth was cleared of conspiracy but found guilty of possession with intent to supply. They’re all set for sentencing on 30 January.
