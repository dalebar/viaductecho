Councillors in Oldham are pushing for free school travel for children living in temporary accommodation, aiming to address the struggles faced by nearly 750 kids who’ve moved far from their schools. Inspired by a Manchester Evening News campaign, Councillor Shoab Akhtar and the group highlight the financial strain on families who now incur hefty travel costs, often forced to choose between long commutes or expensive Ubers. Current rules only grant free transport if kids are over two miles from a suitable school, which is tricky in Greater Manchester. Akhtar argues no child should suffer due to their family’s housing situation and is calling for immediate support from Oldham council. Families like one mum, who spends £40 a day on Ubers, exemplify the urgent need for a solution. With over 5,400 households in temporary accommodation across Greater Manchester, this initiative seeks to lend a hand to those feeling the pressure.
