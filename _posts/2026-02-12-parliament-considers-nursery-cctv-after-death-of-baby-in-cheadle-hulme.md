Keir Starmer’s mulling over making CCTV mandatory in nurseries after the tragic death of baby Genevieve 'Gigi' Meehan at Tiny Toes nursery in Cheadle Hulme back in 2022. Gigi suffocated after a nursery worker swaddled her too tightly and left her unattended on a bean bag. The worker, Kate Roughley, ignored Gigi's struggles and was later convicted of unlawful act manslaughter, receiving a 14-year prison sentence. During Prime Minister’s Questions, Lib Dem MP Munira Wilson highlighted the need for better nursery protections, citing multiple abuse cases linked to nurseries. She urged for mandatory CCTV, alongside unannounced Ofsted inspections and stricter training standards for safer sleep practices. Starmer acknowledged the seriousness of these cases, pledging to consider the introduction of CCTV and strengthen safeguarding measures in the early years sector.
