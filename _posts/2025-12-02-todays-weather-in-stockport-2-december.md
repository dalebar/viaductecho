Weather in Stockport is looking a bit all over the place on Tuesday. You’ll kick off the day with some early morning rain, which should ease off, leaving behind partly cloudy skies. Expect a cool maximum of 8°C and a minimum of 5°C, with humidity sitting high at 87%. It’ll feel even chillier thanks to brisk winds hitting around 24 mph, especially in open areas.

If you’re commuting, definitely grab some rain gear for the morning, as that rain might throw a spanner in the works for traffic and public transport. Visibility could take a hit too due to the dampness. 

Dress smart for the day—think layers and a waterproof jacket to stay comfy as the weather shifts between wet and windy. And don’t forget to secure any loose bits outside to prevent them from blowing around. Keeping an eye on real-time weather updates will also help you plan your day better!
