Two people tragically lost their lives in a horrific attack at a synagogue in north Manchester on October 2. Armed police responded shortly after 9:30 am to the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue after reports of a car driving into the public and a stabbing incident. The assailant never entered the synagogue; he was shot dead by police at the scene. Five others were injured, and three are in serious condition. Authorities are treating this as a suspected terror attack under the UK's emergency response protocol, PLATO. Worshippers were held inside initially but have since been evacuated. Greater Manchester Police are in touch with local synagogues to reassure the community, especially given the attack occurred on Yom Kippur, a significant Jewish holiday. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the act, promising increased police presence at synagogues nationwide. In the meantime, the area remains cordoned off, with police urging the public to stay away and to avoid sharing footage of the incident on social media.
