Stockport is set to welcome a new Lidl after the supermarket won a planning appeal against the council. Located at the old Cheadle Heath Works on Stockport Road, the plans were initially rejected in 2025 due to traffic concerns and impacts on the local area’s character. Lidl appealed the decision, arguing that local support was significant, and after a site visit, the Planning Inspectorate ruled in Lidl's favour, noting the new development would enhance the area rather than harm it. Local councillor David Meller expressed disappointment, particularly over ignored highway issues. However, he acknowledged the dilapidated building would finally be removed. The council sought to have Lidl cover costs related to the appeal but this was denied, as the inspector found Lidl’s actions reasonable throughout the process.
