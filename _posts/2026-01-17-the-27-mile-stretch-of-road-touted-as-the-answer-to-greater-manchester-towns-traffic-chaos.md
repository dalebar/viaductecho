A new relief road in Partington and Carrington aims to tackle traffic issues and improve travel times. The 2.7-mile route, connecting the A6144 Manchester Road and Carrington Spur, is part of the broader New Carrington masterplan for building around 5,000 homes and 350,000sqm of employment space by 2040. Planning approval has been sought, with plans for six new junctions and a mix of single and dual-carriageway. The One Trafford Partnership sees it as a chance to address persistent transport challenges and promote regeneration. Paths and cycle lanes will encourage active travel, and future measures for road safety in Carrington village are also on the table. However, the project has faced criticism, particularly concerning its impact on farmland and local ecosystems. The Friends of Carrington Moss group argues against building on productive agricultural land, suggesting funds would be better spent on public transport improvements. Trafford Council insists that the road will enhance accessibility and reduce congestion, ultimately fostering growth and providing safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists.
