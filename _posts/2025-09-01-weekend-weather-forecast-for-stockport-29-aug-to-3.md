This weekend in Stockport, expect a mostly cloudy vibe with rain showers on both days. Daytime temps will hit about 20°C, dropping to 13°C at night. Friday kicks off with morning rain clearing to partly cloudy skies, while Saturday sees afternoon rain and stronger winds. Sunday brings more clouds and intermittent rain, with highs again around 20°C. 

Humidity will be high throughout, especially on Saturday, and winds will be brisk, so it's worth packing a windproof jacket and an umbrella. Commuters should allow extra time for wet roads and secure loose items. If you’re planning to head out, be ready for rain and consider some indoor fun like museums or cafés if the weather turns. Stay layered to adapt to the chill!
