A gang in Greater Manchester has been causing a stir with organised ram raids, leading to losses of at least £260,000 for businesses. They used a consistent method, either ramming through shutters or using tools to break in. Danny Cawley, a 'career criminal' from Oldham, has been sentenced to six years for his involvement as the gang’s driver, having admitted to 25 burglaries and one attempted burglary. The crime spree, which lasted from April to August last year, targeted businesses in Stockport, Trafford Park, Rochdale, Oldham, and Salford. With police launching a special operation, another suspect has been identified, while one is still unknown. A salon owner in Ashton-under-Lyne expressed her worries about her staff’s safety and mental wellbeing after the incident. Judge Tina Landale highlighted Cawley’s significant role in these professionally planned crimes, causing anxiety and financial strain for the affected businesses. He’ll serve at least 40% of his sentence before potentially being released on licence.
