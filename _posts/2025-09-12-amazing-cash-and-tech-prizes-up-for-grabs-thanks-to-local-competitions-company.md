High Peak Comps is rolling out some exciting prize draws this September! They've got two major competitions: the first offers a chance to win £50,000 with tickets at just 49p. This draw runs until Sunday 28 September, with the winner revealed live on Facebook at 8pm that evening. You can buy up to 2,000 tickets to boost your odds.

The second competition features a massive £150,000 prize pot split into over 11,000 prizes, including cash and tech goodies like PS5s and Dyson Air Wraps. So far, 4,052 prizes have been won! Plus, participants who don’t win will be automatically entered into a £10,000 draw on 24 September at 8pm.

High Peak Comps is also committed to supporting local causes, recently donating to charities like Stockport Sands and Stepping Hill Hospital's mental health nurses. Since its inception in March 2020, they've given away an impressive £10 million in prizes. Check out their contests and maybe you’ll be the next big winner!
