The by-election in Gorton and Denton has become intensely competitive and contentious, with campaigners facing everything from aggressive door-to-door interactions to allegations of election offences investigated by police. It's sparking interest among locals, with candidates like Labour’s Angeliki Stogia, the Green's ‘Hannah the plumber,’ and Reform UK's Matt Goodwin all offering diverse perspectives on issues like poverty and immigration. The campaign is deeply tied to the performance of Keir Starmer's government, with constituents eager for real change after years of Tory rule that have left many struggling. The fight has ignited a passionate response from residents, highlighting ideological divides and the urgency for effective representation. Meanwhile, tensions are heightened with the looming presence of far-right groups planning a march this weekend, prompting local leaders to voice their disapproval. As voting day approaches, the situation remains charged, capturing not just local concerns but a broader reflection of the UK's political landscape.
