Joshua Adiefeh, a 20-year-old first-year accounting and finance student at Manchester Metropolitan University, tragically passed away on September 28 after suffering severe stomach pain and a blocked intestine. Just a week after moving into university halls, he began experiencing symptoms that worsened overnight while visiting with his twin brother Joel and older brother Daniel. An ambulance couldn't attend immediately, so Joel rushed for paracetamol, only to find Joshua unconscious upon returning. Despite paramedicsâ€™ efforts, he was pronounced dead within two hours. 

Family and friends, including more than 300 attendees, celebrated Joshua's life with tributes, speeches, and a balloon release in Nottingham. His brother Daniel described him as "selfless" and emphasized their close bond. Manchester Metropolitan University has extended condolences to Joshua's family and provided support services for affected students. A spokesperson for North West Ambulance Service invited the family to share their concerns for investigation.
