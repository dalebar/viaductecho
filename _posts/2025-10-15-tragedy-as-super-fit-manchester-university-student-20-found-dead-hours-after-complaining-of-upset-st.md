Tributes have been paid to 20-year-old Joshua Adiefeh, a fit first-year student at Manchester Metropolitan University, who sadly died in his accommodation after feeling unwell. Just hours before, he mentioned having an upset stomach to fellow students. His brothers, who described Joshua as hardworking, friendly, and a "man of faith," recounted the frantic moments leading up to his passing on September 28. Despite calling for an ambulance, they were told to manage his symptoms with paracetamol, but Joshua's condition deteriorated. When they found him unresponsive, the ambulance arrived but could not save him. His family, still trying to understand the circumstances of his sudden death, highlighted his commitment to fitness and his caring nature. Joshuaâ€™s twin, Joel, expressed deep sorrow over losing someone he was inseparable from, while Daniel noted that Joshua aimed to uplift those around him. The family has created a Go Fund Me to assist with funeral costs.
