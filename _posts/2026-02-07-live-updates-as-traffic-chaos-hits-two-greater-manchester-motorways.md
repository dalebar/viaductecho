Traffic’s a right mess on two Greater Manchester motorways this afternoon. The M62 Eastbound traffic’s been held up between junctions 18 and 19 since just after 4pm. Further east, there’s a lane closed due to a vehicle fire between junctions 21 and 22. On the M60, one lane’s also shut at junction 7 because of a broken-down vehicle. Plus, there’s been all-day congestion on the M62 Eastbound between junctions 11 and 12 from flooding, leading to two lanes being closed. Emergency services are on the scene dealing with it all. Stay tuned for updates!
