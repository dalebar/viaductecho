Lee Dunne, a drug dealer, was jailed for 15 months after being caught promoting illegal drug sales in Northwich with cheeky "buy three get one free" offers. Surprisingly, he was released the same day due to the lengthy court process while on remand. In April 2025, police flagged a mobile number linked to Dunne that was used to send out messages selling crack cocaine and heroin. After being arrested, evidence from his phone confirmed his involvement in drug trafficking. Alongside drug charges, he also faced shoplifting for nicking a £44 bottle of whiskey from Waitrose. Dunne pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 months in prison but walked free due to already serving eight months. PC Ed Whalley from Northwich CID remarked on the negative impact drug dealing has on the community and encouraged anyone with information to reach out to the police.
