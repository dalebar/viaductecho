HYROX is coming back to Manchester in January 2026, promising to be one of the year's biggest events at Manchester Central Convention Complex. If you've got a ticket, it’s time to start prepping! HYROX is a tough fitness race, featuring eight 1km runs and eight workout stations like the sled push, ski erg, and burpees. 

Here’s a quick guide to preparing: 

1. **Run Smart**: Mix long runs with intervals for endurance and speed.
2. **Master the Stations**: Focus on form and practice under fatigue.
3. **Strength Training**: Compound lifts build the strength you need.
4. **Train Under Fatigue**: Practice workouts right after runs.
5. **Recover Properly**: Rest days are crucial to avoid injury.
6. **Fuel Up**: Have a nutrition strategy for the long race.
7. **Pacing**: Don't go all out too soon; find a sustainable pace.
8. **Mobility Work**: Keep your joints flexible for efficiency.
9. **Track Progress**: Monitor improvements to stay motivated.
10. **Train with a Community**: Join others for added motivation and fun.
