The liquidation of the Salford Red Devils is seen by political leaders as a potential stepping stone for a brighter future for the iconic 152-year-old club. Following a brief court hearing regarding an unpaid tax bill, the club's existence has ended, exacerbated by financial issues and a Crisis-hit season. Local leaders, including Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, view the decision as a necessary move for revitalisation, ensuring the club's legacy continues. 

Former CEO Chris Irwin is working with a consortium to create a sustainable plan for a new team, aiming for competition in the Rugby League Championship by January 2026. Meanwhile, Councillor Jack Youd emphasised the need for a supportive process from the Rugby Football League (RFL) to establish stability in elite rugby in Salford. The community, including passionate fan groups, will play a key role in rebuilding, demonstrating resilience despite current uncertainties. Overall, there's a sense of optimism that Salford rugby can rise again stronger from this challenging chapter.
