There’s a nifty little hack at Manchester Airport that lets passengers bypass the long security queues—without shelling out for FastTrack! It’s called TimeSlot, and it allows up to six people to book a specific time to enter security. Some slots are free, while popular times are only £4.99—slightly less than FastTrack’s starting price of a fiver. 

Once you've got your TimeSlot booked, just check in your bags and head towards departures. You’ll be directed to a dedicated lane to skip the standard queues. You can book TimeSlots up to 60 days ahead, with options available from 3am to 10pm daily, aiming for around two hours before your flight. 

Just a heads up though: this service isn’t suitable for those needing Assisted Travel, travelling with pushchairs or car seats, or infants under three. In those cases, you’ll be sent to the Assistance Lane without needing a TimeSlot. Check out the Manchester Airport website for more info and booking details. Happy travels!
