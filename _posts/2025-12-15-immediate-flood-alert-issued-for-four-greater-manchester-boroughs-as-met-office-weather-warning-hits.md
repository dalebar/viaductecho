A flood alert has been issued for parts of Greater Manchester, including Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, and Bury, due to rising river levels after heavy overnight rain. The Environment Agency warned that the situation is being monitored, as more rain is expected today. Areas affected by the alert include various rivers and locations like Farnworth and Radcliffe. Residents are advised to stay prepared, check for updates, and have a flood plan ready. The Met Office has also issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with predictions of 40-60mm of rainfall, and up to 100mm on high ground by the end of the day. This wet weather pattern is likely to continue throughout the week. Local agencies are actively working to mitigate flooding impacts, urging people not to drive through floodwater, as even shallow streams can be dangerous. Keep an eye on updates from the Environment Agency for the latest news.
