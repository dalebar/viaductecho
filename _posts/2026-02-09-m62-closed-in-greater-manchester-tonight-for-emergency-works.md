The M62 in Greater Manchester is closed eastbound between Junctions 11 and 12 tonight for emergency repairs due to flooding. The closure started around 9pm and is expected to last until 6:30am on Monday, February 9. National Highways has confirmed that this is to fix a drainage issue. For those needing to travel, a diversion route is set up: exit the M62 at Junction 11, take the fourth exit onto the M62 westbound, and then follow specific roads to get back on track. Road signs with Hollow Triangle symbols will guide motorists through the detour. Safe travels, everyone!
