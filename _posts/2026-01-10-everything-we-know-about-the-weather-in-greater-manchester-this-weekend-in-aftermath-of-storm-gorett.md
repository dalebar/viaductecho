Storm Goretti has left a trail of chaos this weekend, bringing snow, heavy rain, hail, and nearly 100mph winds. The Met Office issued a rare red wind warning for the South West, alongside amber and yellow alerts for snow and ice across the UK. Although the storm has moved east, more wet and snowy weather is expected. In Greater Manchester, there's a yellow warning in effect until midday today due to potential 'refreezing snow' and 'freezing fog', with temperatures hovering around 3C. Conditions should stay settled with a mix of sun and clouds. The yellow ice warning also covers the North of England, as well as parts of Wales, the Midlands, and the South. Today, a snow and ice advisory is in place until 3pm for much of the North East and Scotland. Looking ahead, more snow could hit Greater Manchester from Sunday morning around 6:30am. Stay tuned for live updates on the weekend weather!
