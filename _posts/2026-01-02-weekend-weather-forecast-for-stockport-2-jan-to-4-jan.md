This weekend in Stockport looks pretty clear and crisp, but it's going to be cold! Friday kicks off with the chance of morning snow or rain, with temps ranging from -1°C to 4°C and high humidity of 70%. Saturday offers bright sunshine, slightly cooler with highs of 2°C, and a gentle breeze. Sunday continues the clear trend but gets even chillier, peaking at just 1°C. Humidity will be a bit higher, but winds will be light, making it calm overall.

If you’re commuting on Friday, be mindful of potentially slippery roads in the morning. For the rest of the weekend, clear skies mean smoother travels. It’s a great time for outdoor activities—just remember to bundle up! The early rain might put a dampener on Friday morning plans, but Saturday and Sunday promise lovely conditions for walks and local explorations. Stay warm and enjoy that crisp winter air!
