Kirsty McKie, a 38-year-old from Stockport, tragically passed away in Bali in 2022 due to methanol poisoning after consuming contaminated limoncello, misjudged as a hangover. Her mother, Margaret, is now campaigning to raise awareness about the dangers of drinking alcohol in certain countries, urging tourists to avoid spirits, even if purchased from reputable places. Methanol poisoning has been linked to over 14,000 global deaths since 1998, highlighting a serious issue for travellers. 

Margaret’s efforts follow further incidents, such as the death of Brit Simone White in Laos in 2024 after drinking tainted alcohol at a hostel. She criticises lenient penalties for those involved and the lack of support from governments prioritising tourism over safety. The UK Foreign Office is updating guidance for travellers and incorporating methanol awareness into school curriculums, but Margaret believes more needs to be done. Symptoms of methanol poisoning can mimic hangovers, complicating detection. Raising awareness through campaigns, she aims to prevent others from enduring similar tragedies.
