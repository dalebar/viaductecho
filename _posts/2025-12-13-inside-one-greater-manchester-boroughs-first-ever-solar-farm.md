Oldham is buzzing with the construction of its first solar farm, located next to the Rochdale Canal in Failsworth. This council-funded initiative will see around 2,700 solar panels installed on a 3.5-acre plot called Wrigley Head, creating local green jobs and cutting energy costs. Coun Abdul Jabbar praised it as a big step towards generating renewable energy and supporting local training. Expected to power around 310 homes with approximately 830,000 kWh of electricity yearly, the solar farm is set to be operational by spring 2026 and will initially sell its electricity to a power company. The project, part of Oldham's Green New Deal, also aims to enhance the site's ecology, planting new trees and flowers while ensuring wildlife can roam freely. Although initially planned for completion in autumn 2025, it faced delays due to various challenges. The total cost of around £1.35 million will be funded from the council's budget. Exciting times for Oldham as it steps up its green game!
