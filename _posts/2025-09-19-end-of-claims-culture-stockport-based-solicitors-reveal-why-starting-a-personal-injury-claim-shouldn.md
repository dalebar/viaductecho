Their team offers support throughout the process on a no win-no fee basis, which can significantly enhance your chances of a successful outcome. They also assist with practical needs, like organising hire cars or arranging physiotherapy. Rachael emphasises that making a claim isn’t just about compensation; it can also encourage accountability and promote safety. For anyone considering a claim, Marlow Braide's expertise could be a game-changer compared to going it alone or using AI.
