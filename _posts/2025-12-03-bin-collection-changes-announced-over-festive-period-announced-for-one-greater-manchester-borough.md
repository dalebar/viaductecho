In Tameside, there'll be changes to bin collection timings over Christmas and New Year. No brown bin collections will happen from December 25 to January 7, to help crews catch up after the bank holidays on December 25, 26, and January 1. Green, black, and blue bin collections will continue as usual. Residents can download the free Tameside bin app for collection dates, reminders, and to report missing bins. Real Christmas trees can be recycled for Willow Wood Hospice from January 5-9; register for collection at www.just-helping.org.uk/register-tree by January 4, 2026. Coun Laura Boyle reassured residents about minimal disruption and thanked those who recycle for their environmental efforts, as well as the dedicated bin crews working throughout the festive season.
