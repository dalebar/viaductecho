On Monday evening (December 22), Greater Manchester experienced major train disruptions, leading to multiple cancellations. The chaos stemmed from a fault on a train between Preston and Bolton, causing lines to be blocked around 6.50pm. Northern Rail informed passengers that services through these stations would be delayed, cancelled, or revised. Moreover, they lifted ticket restrictions in affected areas during this time. National Rail also noted delays of up to 50 minutes, with services like Blackpool North to Manchester Airport and several others hit hard. The 5.48pm and 7.17pm trains from Manchester Airport to Blackpool were among those scrapped, and additional cancellations occurred due to crew shortages on other services. Northern Rail apologised for the disruptions, assuring passengers they could travel on other services near their original departure times.
