Salford MP Rebecca Long-Bailey has expressed her shock and sadness following an attack at the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester, which resulted in two fatalities and three serious injuries. The incident occurred during Yom Kippur, a significant time for the Jewish community. Long-Bailey extended her thoughts and prayers to the affected families and communities, emphasising the need to confront antisemitism and all forms of hatred. Greater Manchester Police also voiced their concern, noting the fear the attack has caused across communities and commending a member of the public whose quick action likely prevented further harm. The police are maintaining contact with synagogues for reassurance and have requested that anyone with relevant footage share it directly with them instead of posting on social media.
