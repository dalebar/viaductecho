A Manchester United fan from Oldham was sentenced to over three years for shaking his newborn daughter, causing severe brain damage after his team lost the FA Cup final. Left alone with the four-week-old while his partner went out, he became angry and violently shook the baby, later messaging her mother about blood being present. It wasnâ€™t until a routine check-up that medical staff discovered her serious injuries, including brain trauma and suspected fractures. Emergency surgery was required, and the child now faces long-term neurological challenges. The mother, who was out during the incident, received a nearly three-year sentence for neglect. Both parents were jailed to protect the child's identity, and the little girl is now in the care of family members. Her grandmother shared how the once-healthy baby now has significant developmental delays but remains cheerful in spirit amid ongoing difficulties.
