Transport chiefs have outlined the Bee Network bus services and stops impacted by a serious police incident in Crumpsall, where two people tragically lost their lives outside a synagogue. Armed police responded to the scene on Middleton Road after reports of a stabbing. The suspect was shot by officers and later died. Three others were seriously injured. Middleton Road has been cordoned off, affecting bus services 41 and 59, which are now on diversion via Manchester New Road, Rochdale Road, and Shudehill. Check the Transport for Greater Manchester website for updates, but it seems Metrolink tram services are still running as usual.
