Greater Manchester is bracing for nearly 24 hours of wintry weather starting late Thursday morning. Some higher areas already saw a light dusting of snow. A Met Office snow and ice warning was in effect until 9am today, focusing on the eastern parts of the region. The forecast indicates that snow will hit areas like Rochdale and Oldham around 11.30am, spreading more widely as the afternoon progresses, particularly around the Pennines and Peak District, with the possibility of sleet and rain throughout the day. The wintry weather is expected to linger into Thursday night and into Friday morning, before transitioning to more widespread rain. Temperatures will fluctuate, with highs of 8C today but feeling colder, especially at night with lows dropping to around 1C. The weekend should be mostly dry but overcast. Stay warm out there!
