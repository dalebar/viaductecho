High Peak Comps is running some cracking prize draws this October, including a chance to win £20,000 for just 20p a ticket—up to 2,000 tickets can be bought! This competition wraps up on Sunday 12 October, and the winner will be announced live on their Facebook page. 

They’re also hosting an instant win contest for Jellycat toys with 1,990 prizes available, priced at £3.90 per ticket. With over 600 already won, this contest ends on Saturday 25 October.

Recently, lucky Christine snagged £50,000 from a draw, and High Peak Comps continues to support local causes, like donating equipment for a sensory room at Beltane College. They've been around since March 2020 and have given away £10 million in prizes. If you're running a community project and need support, just drop them an email. 

Keep an eye on their Facebook page for updates, and if you’re keen on a bit of fun, grab your tickets now!
