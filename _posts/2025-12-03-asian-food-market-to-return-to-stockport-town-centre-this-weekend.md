Next weekend, Stockport will be in for a treat as St Mary's Church transforms into an Asian street market! On Friday, 12 December, from 5-10pm, you can enjoy a range of delicious cuisines from Japan, Korea, Thailand, and more. Organised by Eat Good West UK, the event also includes live music and a peek inside the historic church, which dates back 700 years. 

Eat Good West has become the go-to spot for Asian food lovers in Stockport, providing local chefs and small business owners with a platform to showcase their talents. The market has built a lovely community vibe, where everyone can eat, chat, and connect. 

If you can’t make this one-off event, no worries! They hold markets every second Friday of the month, so you’ll have plenty of chances to indulge in scrumptious Asian dishes while supporting local talent. Plus, don't forget to check out the upcoming Stockport Moon Festival next year, which draws in thousands of visitors!
