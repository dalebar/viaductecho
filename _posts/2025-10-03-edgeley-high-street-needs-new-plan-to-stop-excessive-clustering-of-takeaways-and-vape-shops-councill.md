Councillors in Stockport are urging for a new policy to manage shop types on Castle Street in Edgeley, aimed at curbing the over-concentration of takeaways, vape shops, and barbershops. They’re worried about local traders struggling to keep afloat and are seeking more support from the council. A motion is set to be discussed at a meeting next week, highlighting various challenges like retail changes, vacant shops, and safety concerns for pedestrians. Suggestions for improvement include introducing a class control policy and drafting a regeneration strategy within six months. Despite a recent uptick in visitor numbers and the lowest vacancy rates among Stockport's district centres, concerns remain about the future, especially with ongoing roadworks at Greek Street Bridge causing disruptions until 2026. Cllr Asa Caton noted that many traders are facing tough times ahead. The council will deliberate on Castle Street's future on October 9.
