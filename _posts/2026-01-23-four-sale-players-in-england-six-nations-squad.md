England have called up 20-year-old prop Vilikesa 'Billy' Sela for the Six Nations due to injuries in the tighthead position, marking his first time in the squad. Exeter’s number eight, Greg Fisilau, also joins the team thanks to his impressive performance at club level, adding depth to the back row. 

The forward selection includes notable players like Ollie Chessum, Tom Curry, and Maro Itoje, among others. Sela was part of the victorious Under-20 World Cup squad, showcasing promising talent in England’s future prop prospects. Fisilau, who has family roots in Tonga, has been key in Exeter's recent success. Meanwhile, Leicester’s Emeka Ilione, although a powerful runner, hasn’t had as much game time as Fisilau, which likely influenced Borthwick's decision.
