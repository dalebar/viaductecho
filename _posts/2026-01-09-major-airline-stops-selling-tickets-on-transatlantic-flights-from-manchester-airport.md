Aer Lingus has announced it will stop selling long-haul flight tickets from Manchester Airport to the US and Caribbean after March 31. This decision comes amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the airline's Manchester base, which serves routes to New York, Barbados, and Orlando, and employs around 200 staff. Previously, the airline indicated that profitability at this base is lagging behind its operations in Ireland, prompting a consultation with workers about potential job impacts. Although the airline maintains that the Manchester base is profitable, the margins are significantly lower compared to other areas of its business. Currently, there is no effect on flights between Manchester and Ireland. Aer Lingus is reaching out to customers with existing bookings and is looking into ways to support affected staff, including alternative employment options and severance packages. The airline started its long-haul operations from Manchester in 2021, and any base closure would terminate flights to popular destinations like Orlando's Disney World.
