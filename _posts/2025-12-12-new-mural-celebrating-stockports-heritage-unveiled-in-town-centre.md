A vibrant new mural celebrating Stockport's heritage crafts has been unveiled near the town centre, designed by the talented artist Oskar. It graces the facade of Kingston House, currently an artist studio for GRIT, a local collective. The mural features designs that highlight various crafts central to Stockport's identity, encapsulating themes of creativity and resilience. It was completed as part of the 'Crafted Futures Week', organised by GRIT, which aimed to keep traditional crafts alive through workshops for young creatives led by skilled artisans in fields like stone masonry and textiles. Oskar engaged with participants to incorporate their ideas into the mural, making it a community effort. He expressed the project's significance, aiming to reflect Stockport’s rich creative talent. John Macaulay from GRIT praised the collaboration, emphasising its celebration of creativity and heritage.
