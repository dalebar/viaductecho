Rachel Reeves has warned Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham that his push for increased government borrowing could lead to economic trouble, similar to Liz Truss's disastrous mini-budget. In a chat with LBC, she highlighted Burnham's plans, which include raising council tax on expensive London homes and borrowing £40 billion for housing, suggesting they could crash the economy. Reeves emphasised that a significant portion of government spending already goes to debt repayments, and she aims to reduce this through tough decisions, maintaining that there's nothing progressive about high borrowing. Despite speculation that Burnham might challenge Sir Keir Starmer for leadership, he insists he’s committed to his work in Greater Manchester. The backdrop of Reeves' comments reflects on the fiscal chaos experienced during Truss's brief time in office, where her borrowing-driven tax cuts led to market upheaval.
