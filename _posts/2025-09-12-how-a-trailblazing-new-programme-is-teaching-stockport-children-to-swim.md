One in three kids in the UK leave primary school unable to swim 25 metres, but Swim:ED's pop-up pool programme is changing that with impressive resultsâ€”boosting swimming abilities by 160%! This initiative, delivered in Stockport by FIFTH Movement, addresses the swimming crisis by bringing purpose-built pools directly to schools. In 2022/23, about 36% of state primary schools offered little to no swim lessons, but Swim:ED offers a solution with on-site facilities and qualified instructors.

The programme shows fantastic outcomes: 53% of Year 6 pupils can now swim 25 metres unaided (up from 20.7%), while those able to swim multiple strokes jumped from 26% to 71%. Safe self-rescue knowledge skyrocketed by nearly 500%, and kids are now much better at understanding water safety. Over three weeks, students participate in 15 lessons in small groups, ensuring they receive personal support. FIFTH Movement is keen on expanding this valuable programme to more local schools next year. Schools interested in getting involved can reach out to Jared at FIFTH Movement for more info and to help their kids become water confident!
