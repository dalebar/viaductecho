Traffic on the M56 near Manchester Airport has been a bit of a pickle this morning due to a truck fire, leading to the closure of two lanes on the eastbound side at junction six for Hale Road. While things have calmed down and all lanes have reopened, there are still delays of about 15 to 20 minutes with congestion stretching back to junction seven. Fire crews were on-site to tackle the situation, but thankfully, the issues appear to be clearing up now. Keep an eye out for any lingering hold-ups if you're heading that way!
