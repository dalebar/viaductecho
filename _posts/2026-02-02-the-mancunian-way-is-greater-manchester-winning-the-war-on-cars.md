Greater Manchester is seeing a shift in transport habits after nine years of development, with more people walking and cycling while car use for short trips is on the decline. Cycling trips surged to over 58 million in a year—a 58% rise since 2022—highlighted by record numbers at cycle counters and significant increases in usage of popular routes like the Whelley loop line. The goal is to sharply reduce car reliance by 2040 for a healthier environment, but challenges remain, such as traffic congestion evident during recent busy weekends. Dame Sarah Storey noted that enhancing cycling infrastructure encourages active travel, though work on safety perceptions is still needed. In other news, a tragic reminder of crime’s impact was shared, as families grapple with memories from a 2003 murder case. Meanwhile, Manchester United fans protested club management issues despite some on-field successes. Lastly, a heartwarming tale of a cockatiel named Butters features a rescue mission aided by a catchy tune. Weather forecasts hint at potential snow while roadworks are extending in parts of Cheadle, affecting traffic.
