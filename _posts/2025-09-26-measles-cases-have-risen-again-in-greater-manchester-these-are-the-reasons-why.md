Measles cases are on the rise in Greater Manchester, with Salford recording 40 out of 772 confirmed cases in the UK this year, ranking third after London and Bristol. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) revealed that measles is highly contagious—almost twice as infectious as a cold—and can lead to severe health issues, especially for babies and those with weakened immune systems. Dr Helen Wall from NHS Greater Manchester emphasises the importance of the MMR vaccine, as current vaccination rates are alarmingly low at 83.7% nationally and 84.3% in Greater Manchester. Many parents underestimate the risks of measles, especially as misinformation about vaccines spreads online. Dr Wall advises that vaccinations are key to protection and encourages families to catch up on missed doses, stressing the importance of staying fully vaccinated to protect the entire community. For those concerned, it’s never too late to get vaccinated; contact your GP or check local catch-up clinics. Symptoms of measles typically appear 7-10 days after exposure, so awareness is crucial!
