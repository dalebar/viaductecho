The Friends of Victoria Park (FOVPS) are in a tough spot, racing against time to raise £10k by the end of the month to keep their popular café, The Tea Room, open. Rising energy, supply, and staffing costs have made things dire, especially after a difficult winter. Operational manager Nadia Gubba mentioned they've tried various cost-saving measures, but nothing’s worked. They cater mainly to lower-income families, aiming to keep events affordable. If they can’t hit their target, even a short closure could lead to job losses and make it hard to bounce back. Trafford Council, which values the café as a community gem, has expressed its sadness over the situation and is keen to help find a solution, although it’s clear they're not responsible for covering the café’s costs directly. The clock is ticking for this beloved local hub!
