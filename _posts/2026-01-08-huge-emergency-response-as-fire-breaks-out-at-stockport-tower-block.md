Firefighters responded to a blaze at Hanover Towers in Stockport last night. Footage showed multiple fire engines racing to the scene, where smoke was seen billowing from a top-floor apartment. The Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) reported they were called at about 7:30 pm to handle a fire caused by a blocked bin chute. Four fire engines from various local stations worked to extinguish the fire and clear the blockage. The crews worked for around 90 minutes before bringing the situation under control.
