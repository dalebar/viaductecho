Hundreds gathered in Heaton Moor to pay tribute to Justin Moorhouse's son, Barney, who passed away at 28. Dressed in Manchester United scarves and shirts, mourners celebrated Barney's life by enjoying drinks from his vintage coffee van. Justin invited everyone who knew Barney to join the farewell, encouraging a casual dress code and supporting the United theme. Despite his Bolton Wanderers loyalties, Paddy McGuinness joined fellow Phoenix Nights stars in showing support. After the park tribute, attendees went to Manchester Crematorium for the service, followed by an afternoon of shared memories at The Frog and Bucket comedy club. Instead of flowers, donations were requested for Burnage Foodbank, reflecting Barney's love for food and helping others. Justin shared heartfelt tributes on social media, recalling Barney as a sweet and kind soul, while also releasing a podcast episode featuring Barney’s contributions. An inquest into Barney's death is ongoing, with police reporting no suspicious circumstances.
