2025 has been a big year for Stockport, with plenty of notable happenings. It kicked off with flooding in January, causing Meadow Mill to be evacuated. February brought the start of Stopford Park, a new housing development with 442 homes, while March saw essential repairs on the Greek Street Bridge. April marked the opening of the Royal Nawaab Pyramid as an events venue specialising in Indian and Pakistani cuisine. 

Filming for a new Netflix series took place in May, followed by the confirmation of a new Metrolink line in June. July saw a £21 million investment to secure the McVitie's factory in Heaton Chapel, and a new café, Brew32, opened in August at The Three Shires. 

In September, Stepping Hill Hospital unveiled a new outpatients building, and in October, the Heaton Lane car park was closed for demolition. November welcomed a new Søstrene Grene store in the town centre, while December celebrated local schools making the Sunday Times' list of the best in the North West. 

Additionally, Marple, Gatley, and Bramhall were highlighted as some of the best places to live in England and Wales. What a year for Stockport!
