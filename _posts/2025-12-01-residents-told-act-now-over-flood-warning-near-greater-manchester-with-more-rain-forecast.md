Residents in Greater Manchester, particularly around Walsden near Todmorden, are being urged to take immediate action due to a flood warning issued by the Environment Agency. Heavy rainfall is forecasted, with flooding expected from 6am on Monday, December 1. Areas affected include Bottomley Lock to Clough Mill, covering key locations such as Rochdale Road, Walsden Station, and Walsden School. The Environment Agency is closely monitoring river and rainfall levels; currently, Walsden Water sits at 0.23 metres, with concerns about property flooding if it rises above 0.96 metres. A Met Office yellow weather warning is also in effect due to anticipated extensive rainfall and potential disruptions to homes, businesses, and transport. Residents are advised to execute their flood plans and stay updated on local water levels. The Leeds Area Incident Room is operational to provide support throughout the day, with further updates expected by late evening.
