Mark Gardner, CEO of the Community Security Trust (CST), expressed serious concerns about rising antisemitism in the UK following recent convictions related to a plot to attack Jews in Manchester. He compared jihadist ideology to Nazism, highlighting the dangers it poses. With two men convicted of attempting mass murder against Jews, Gardner noted that fear is prompting some in the Jewish community to consider leaving Britain for Israel. He acknowledged the efforts of Greater Manchester Police and an undercover operative for thwarting the attack but stated that police resources are limited, urging for increased support. 

Gardner stressed that antisemitism is not just about terrorism but also reflects broader societal issues, lamenting a lack of empathy in various sectors. He warned of a possible mass exodus of Jews from the UK, likening the current situation to that of Jews in France who have fled due to similar threats. Ultimately, he asserted that the fight against hate and violence impacts everyone in society, and it’s crucial for the broader community to recognise and address this issue.
