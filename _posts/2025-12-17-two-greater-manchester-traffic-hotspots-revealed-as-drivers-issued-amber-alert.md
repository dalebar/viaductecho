Drivers are in for a hectic getaway this Christmas, with millions of cars expected on the roads. The AA has issued an amber alert, predicting 24.4 million journeys on Friday, December 19, the busiest day before Christmas. Traffic hotspots in Greater Manchester include the M60 around the Trafford Centre and the Simister Island Interchange, while busy routes across England will see congestion, particularly on the M1 and M6. AA expert Shaun Jones advises planning ahead, checking routes, and allowing extra time. Other busy days include Monday, December 22, and Tuesday, December 23, each with 24 million journeys expected, while Christmas Day will be the quietest with 18.3 million. For a calmer drive, consider Sunday, December 21, or Wednesday, December 24, which will have fewer journeys. Stay patient out there and make sure your car is ready if you're leaving it parked over the festive period!
