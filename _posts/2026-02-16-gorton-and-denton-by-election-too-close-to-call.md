The Gorton and Denton by-election on 26 February is shaping up to be a significant political battleground in Greater Manchester, especially for Labour, Reform UK, and the Green Party. With over 76,000 potential voters, the diverse constituency faces critical issues like the cost of living and a lack of affordable housing.

Historically, Labour has dominated here, but recent controversies, including the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne, have left them vulnerable. They’re focusing on unity and local issues under new candidate Angeliki Stogia. Reform UK's Matt Goodwin is keen to challenge Labour's stronghold, framing this as a referendum on leader Sir Keir Starmer. The Greens, led by Zack Polanski, aim to attract disaffected Labour voters, particularly from the Muslim community, with a message of "hope over hate."

The Liberal Democrats and Conservatives are less prominent in the conversation, but their votes could still affect the outcome. With dynamics shifting and smaller parties also in the mix, every vote will be vital. As polling day nears, the significance of this by-election will only grow.
