Flu cases in England continue to surge, with daily hospital admissions peaking at record levels. Last week, an average of 3,140 patients were in hospital due to flu, marking an 18% increase from the week before. In Greater Manchester, although hospital admissions slightly decreased from 163 to 159 per day, numbers remain high. The North West also saw a 4% drop in hospitalised flu patients, while some regions, like the south-west and eastern England, reported significant increases.

Manchester and Bolton have been notably affected, with Bolton's Royal Hospital seeing 30 daily flu patients recently, which has dropped to 26. In Manchester, the University NHS Foundation Trust reported a decrease from 109 to 107 patients. Despite some regional dips, NHS officials warn that the situation is still critical, exacerbated by strikes among healthcare workers and numerous winter viruses. They emphasise that the public should continue to seek NHS care and stay updated on flu vaccinations. As the festive season approaches, patience and understanding for NHS staff are greatly appreciated.
