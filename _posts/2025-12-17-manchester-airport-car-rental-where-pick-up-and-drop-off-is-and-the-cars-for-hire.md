Flying into Manchester Airport? No worries, getting around's a doddle! If you’re sticking to Greater Manchester, hop on the Bee Network buses or Metrolink trams with their nifty ‘tap-and-go’ payment system, just like in London (though kids don’t get this option). If you're heading from the airport to the city centre, there's now a single ticket you can buy online or at machines, covering any train to Piccadilly.

Thinking of exploring beyond the city? Renting a car's a solid option. The airport’s got four rental companies—Avis, Enterprise, Europcar, and Sixt—all in the ‘Car Rental Village’ on Ringway Road. They’ve got everything from small to premium cars. To get there, just catch the free bus that runs every 10 minutes from the terminals. And don’t fret if you’ve got access needs; the village's step-free. For any questions, you’ll find contact numbers for each car rental firm online. Happy travels!
