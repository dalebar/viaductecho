Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian heritage, has recently been linked to a tragic terrorist attack on a Jewish synagogue in Manchester. His family expressed deep shock and sympathy for the victims, stating their hearts go out to them. Neighbours in Prestwich noted police activity at whatâ€™s believed to be the Al-Shamie family home, with one recalling a baby at the address but not seeing a woman. Another resident recognised Al-Shamie's car from the neighbourhood. Notably, initial police and security records do not show any investigations into him.
