This afternoon, emergency services, including police and paramedics, responded to a welfare concern on Oxford Road in Manchester, close to the University of Manchester and Manchester Met campuses. The call came in around 12:30pm, leading to a large presence of emergency vehicles in the area. A woman in her 60s was taken to hospital for treatment. The scene has now cleared, with all emergency services having left the area. Photos from the incident show multiple vehicles, some with flashing lights, attending to the situation.
