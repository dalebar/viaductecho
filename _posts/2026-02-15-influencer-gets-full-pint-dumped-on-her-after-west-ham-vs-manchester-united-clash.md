Influencer Shania Nadia Howard had a pint thrown over her after mocking West Ham fans outside the London Stadium following a Manchester United match on February 10. While she waved a sign saying “West Ham are s**t” as part of her vlog, she got drenched when someone retaliated with beer. The incident, which she shared online, quickly went viral, garnering 1.5 million views. Shania, a keen Manchester United supporter from Norfolk, expected some verbal backlash but not a drink thrown at her. After the incident, she received concern from a Manchester United steward and changed into dry clothes. The match ended in a 1-1 draw. Shania explained her playful antics were just for laughs, but reactions online were mixed, with some saying it was deserved and others calling it mean-spirited.
