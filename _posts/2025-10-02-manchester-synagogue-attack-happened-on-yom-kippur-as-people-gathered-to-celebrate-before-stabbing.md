A serious incident occurred outside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in North Manchester during Yom Kippur, injuring four people through stabbings and vehicle attacks. Police received reports at 9.31am of a car striking the crowd and a man being stabbed. A security guard was among those injured, leading to police declaring a major incident and investigating it as a potential terror attack. The suspect was shot by police, but there's no longer seen as an active threat. In response, security at all Greater Manchester synagogues has been increased. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed his horror at the attack, emphasising the tragedy of it happening on such a sacred day. The Community Security Trust is coordinating with authorities to support the local Jewish community.
