Nine-year-old Frazer Stapleton from Salford is gearing up for an impressive challenge to run for 30 days straight around Manchester, starting January 26. Inspired by his cousin Kye's battle with kidney failure, Frazer wants to give back to the charity Make a Wish, which supported Kye. His dad, Ryan, described Kye's tough journey with constant hospital visits and dialysis, which eventually led to a transplant when his dad became the donor. Frazer has a big heart, showing kindness through various acts, including fundraising for his football team and surprising his nan's care home with gifts. He’s training hard, running daily with his dad, and has already raised £670 towards his £1,000 goal, even before starting the challenge. With a curious mind about mental health due to family experiences, Frazer's grown closer to his family and continues inspiring others, sharing his journey on TikTok. Everyone's proud of this little legend!
