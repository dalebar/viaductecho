Andy Burnham is chuffed about a possible U-turn on rising business rates for pubs, following concerns from the hospitality industry. The Chancellor's earlier budget plans to end Covid-era discounts had sent rates soaring, but a £4.3bn fund was initially set up to ease the transition. Now, a new support package is expected, including business rates relief and cuts to licensing red tape. Burnham has sensed a shift in ministerial attitudes towards this sector and voiced relief that the government is taking their struggles seriously. He referred to pubs as 'critical infrastructure' for Greater Manchester, noting their importance for local culture and investment. Burnham enjoys the city's vibrant hospitality scene and acknowledges the serious challenges businesses face, describing the looming rate hikes as a potential threat to venues. He encourages continued collaboration for more meaningful reforms in land and property taxes to protect smaller businesses, stressing that the great night out experience in the region must be preserved.
