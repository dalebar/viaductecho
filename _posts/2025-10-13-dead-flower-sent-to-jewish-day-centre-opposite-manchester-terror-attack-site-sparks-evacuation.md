A 'dead flower' found inside an envelope led to an evacuation at the Nicky Alliance Day Centre opposite Heaton Park synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester, on the morning of October 13. Greater Manchester Police arrived around 10am, cordoning off the area for about four-and-a-half hours while investigating the 'suspicious substance'. Thankfully, they confirmed that all occupants were safe and that the item was non-threatening. This comes in the wake of heightened security following a terror attack on Yom Kippur that left two men dead near the centre. Community Security Trust and local emergency services, including Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue and Hatzola Ambulance, were on-site to assist. Police assured everyone that there was no broader risk to the community and appreciated the public's cooperation during the incident.
