Bradley Else, a 26-year-old from Wigan, avoided jail time after being caught smuggling 22 kilos of cannabis at Manchester Airport following a fishing trip to Thailand. Officers arrested him on June 4, his birthday, due to an alleged assault warrant. After being released, he returned to the airport for his suitcase, where Border Force discovered heat-sealed bags of cannabis hidden under his clothes. Else claimed he was just helping a male acquaintance by bringing a suitcase back for £200. Despite having previous convictions, including one for drug possession, the court decided not to jail him. The Recorder of Manchester, Nicholas Dean KC, noted he wasn’t a typical criminal but rather acted foolishly. He received an 18-month suspended sentence, 120 hours of unpaid work, and 20 days of rehabilitation activity. The judge remarked on his naivety, emphasising that he doesn’t appear to be part of an organised crime group. Else had already spent three months in custody waiting for his sentence.
