Police are searching for 66-year-old Martin Lee from Blackpool, who’s been missing since before Christmas. He was reported missing on January 2 and hasn’t reached out to friends since then. Martin is about 5ft 2ins, stocky, and has a full white beard and moustache. He uses walking sticks and occasionally drives a mobility scooter. He also has connections to Salford. The police are asking anyone with information or sightings to contact them by calling 101 and quoting log 0770 of January 2.
