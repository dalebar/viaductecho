Usama Al-Sari, a 28-year-old from Manchester, has been sentenced to 22 years for raping a woman in Heaton Mersey Park while threatening her with what she thought was a gun. He’ll serve 14 years in prison and then 8 on license after pleading guilty to multiple offences. The crime occurred on 9 September 2025, when Al-Sari forced the victim to accompany him before assaulting her. Fortunately, she managed to escape and report the incident to the police, who arrested him within an hour, finding the firearm to be non-viable during a park search. The victim praised Greater Manchester Police for their professionalism and support. Detective Constable Heather Parke highlighted the incident's rarity and the importance of encouraging victims to report such crimes, assuring that they are treated with utmost priority. GMP also urges victims of sexual assault to seek help from support agencies like Saint Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre, Greater Manchester Rape Crisis, and Survivors Manchester, which offer various support services to those in need.
