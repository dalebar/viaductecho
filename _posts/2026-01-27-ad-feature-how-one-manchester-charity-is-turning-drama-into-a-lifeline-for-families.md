Camille, a 40-year-old single mum of five, moved to Hulme from northern Manchester and initially felt isolated and vulnerable. Finding Odd Arts, a local charity that uses theatre for support and empowerment, changed everything for her and her kids. She discovered this organisation while volunteering at a women’s domestic abuse charity, where she saw how theatre could help connect people. Joining a free drama club, her daughters River, 12, Ryder, 11, Rio, 9, and Rumor, 7, began embracing creativity in their lives, with Camille's son Brandon, 18, also participating. The family has grown in confidence and self-expression through their involvement. Odd Arts, funded by the National Lottery, offers trauma-informed workshops and community projects to address inequalities and provide a safe space for young people. Camille appreciates that without such resources, her children would miss out on vital opportunities. The theatre has helped her rediscover her own passions too, allowing her to feel more like herself again. To Camille, theatre is healing, bringing out emotions and leaving her ready to tackle new challenges.
