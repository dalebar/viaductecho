North Manchester General Hospital is set for a major rebuild after receiving £1bn to £1.5bn in government funding. Following years of delays, Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirmed the financial backing last January. The Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) recently updated on progress, revealing they've completed work on the business case detailing the necessary new hospital rooms. They’re collaborating with the New Hospitals Programme (NHP) team, which is pushing for efficiency and better value for money, focusing on transforming healthcare delivery as outlined in the government's 10-Year Health Plan.

The new facility aims to shift from traditional hospital care to more community-based approaches, while ensuring the hospital is equipped for the future. Construction is planned to begin as early as 2027, allowing the current hospital to remain operational during the transformation. The ambitious project promises to regenerate the area and improve local housing alongside creating a state-of-the-art healthcare environment, addressing the long-standing issues of the existing outdated estate, often likened to a '19th century workhouse.'
