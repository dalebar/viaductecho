Matt Goodwin is the Reform UK candidate for Gorton and Denton, diving back into his roots after a stint as a Pizza Hut delivery driver while at Salford University. His selection has sparked controversy, with critics labelling him as part of the 'radical right' and accusing him of racism due to past comments. Goodwin counters these claims, positioning himself as a voice for the neglected local community, addressing key issues like the cost of living, anti-social behaviour, and local business struggles. He aims to tackle what he sees as Labour's historical neglect of the area, advocating for better local investment and transport services. Goodwin emphasises his commitment to representing all constituents, regardless of political views, and calls for a conversation on integration and the challenges of multiculturalism. He also expresses support for local initiatives, including the revival of Denton’s ghost station. On a personal note, he reveals his admiration for Oasis and hopes for an endorsement from Noel Gallagher, tying his campaign to the local culture. Overall, he aims to prioritise Gorton and Denton's needs if elected.
