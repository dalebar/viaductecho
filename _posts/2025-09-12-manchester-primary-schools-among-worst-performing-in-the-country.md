New data shows Manchester's primary schools are among the worst in the country, with nearly half failing to hit reading, writing, and maths standards. Just 55% of schools in the region met performance criteria. In contrast, Trafford shone with 70% of pupils achieving the required standards, making it the top performer outside London. Overall, 62% of Year 6 pupils in England reached Key Stage 2 benchmarks this year, a slight increase from the previous year, but still below pre-pandemic figures, which were 65%. Areas like Norfolk, Sefton, Liverpool, and Blackpool also reported the same 55% achievement rate as Manchester. Meanwhile, London topped the charts, with Hammersmith and Fulham, along with Hackney, boasting over 76% of pupils meeting the expected standards.
