All train services between Manchester Victoria and Chester have been cancelled tonight due to a points failure on the line. Northern Rail announced around 9:30pm that the blockage would cause disruption until about 3am tomorrow. Network Rail is on the case with engineers already deployed. Earlier services have been terminating at Earlestown. On a brighter note, Transport for Wales is still running between Manchester Piccadilly and Chester, and Northern tickets are valid on these trains at no extra charge.
