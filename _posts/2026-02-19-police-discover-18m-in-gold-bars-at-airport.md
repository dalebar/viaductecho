A court has ruled that Greater Manchester Police can keep £1.8 million worth of gold bars seized from a bloke trying to fly out with them in May 2025. The bars, weighing over 15kg, led to a significant investigation by the Economic and Cyber Crime Unit, culminating in the largest recovery ever for GMP. Half of this haul will go towards community projects in Greater Manchester through the Asset Recovery Incentivisation Scheme, benefiting 12 groups, including a boxing club in Bolton offering free classes for kids. Det Insp Sarah Langley emphasised the force's dedication to tackling money laundering in all forms, ensuring that criminal profits don’t pay off.
