Residents in Bredbury, Stockport, are pushing for action on George Lane, where speeding has become a dangerous issue. Sixty locals have signed a petition urging the council to install a speed camera or implement other measures to tackle vehicles exceeding the 30mph limit. They've highlighted ongoing concerns about speeding, crashes—some involving pets—and the need for safer streets, noting that past attempts to address the problem have been ineffective. The petition, which started in early September and runs for six weeks, aims to prevent further harm to the community. Data from Transport for Greater Manchester shows several accidents on the road in recent years, including two serious incidents in 2021. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police conducts speed checks but hasn't commented specifically on the situation on George Lane. Residents hope the council will take their concerns seriously to improve safety in the area.
