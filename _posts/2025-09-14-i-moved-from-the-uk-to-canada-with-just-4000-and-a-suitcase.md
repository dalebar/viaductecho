Jennifer Winters, originally from Milnrow, Rochdale, is now living her dream as a truck driver in Canada. After leaving a tough relationship at 30, she pursued her passion and emigrated, inspired by an Uber driver who encouraged her to break into the male-dominated trucking world. She trained hard, passed her truck tests, and found a job with Newmarket Equipment in Ontario.

Over the past year, she’s driven over 16 states in the US, documenting her adventures on her YouTube channel, "Trucking With Jen." Although she faces some underestimation as a woman in the industry, she's loving the journey. Despite the long hours and isolated lifestyle, she's making the most of it by exploring new places, even planning to apply for permanent residency soon.

To support others, she’s written an e-book on how to emigrate and enter the Canadian trucking industry. Her advice? "Just go for it!" It’s all about embracing opportunities, even if it’s not as glamorous as it seems.
