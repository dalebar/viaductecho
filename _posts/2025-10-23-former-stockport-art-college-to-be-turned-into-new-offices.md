Big changes are on the horizon for Stockport! The former Stockport Art College on Greek Street is set to transform into a vibrant workspace and social hub named Cheers and Smith, thanks to Cityheart. This project, part of the £120m Stopford Park development, will preserve the grade-II listed building while giving it a fresh purpose. Work kicks off this autumn, with the space expected to open for local businesses in about a year. 

The wider Stopford Park initiative includes 442 new homes, an 'Art Park', and improved public areas, making it a key player in Stockport’s £1bn town centre regeneration. With plans for 8,000 new homes overall, Stockport's council leader Mark Roberts is excited about revitalising the town’s heritage and creating opportunities for locals. Cheers and Smith is seen as an essential part of breathing new life into the area, fostering creativity and collaboration for entrepreneurs and freelancers alike. It's an exciting time for Stockport, as this development aims to enhance community spirit and make the town a better place to live and work.
