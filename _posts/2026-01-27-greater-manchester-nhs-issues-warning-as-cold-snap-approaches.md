Greater Manchester's NHS is facing significant pressures as hospitals report they are struggling to provide comprehensive care due to high bed occupancy levels, averaging 94.6% recently. This spike is partly driven by rising cases of norovirus, which is causing added strain during the winter months. Dr Manisha Kumar, the chief medical officer, emphasised the importance of personal health measures and checking in on vulnerable neighbours to ease NHS demands. Some hospitals have been under OPEL 4 status, indicating severe operational pressure, especially with staffing impacted by seasonal illnesses. Occupancy rates at acute trusts vary, with Stockport NHS Foundation Trust at the highest (97.6%), while Bolton NHS Foundation Trust has the lowest (92%). As demand continues to outpace discharges, many patients are stuck in hospitals when they could be at home, adding to the crisis. The NHS is urging the public to take precautions and seek timely advice to help alleviate the pressure on services during this challenging time.
