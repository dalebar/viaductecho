A second heritage group has jumped on board to stop the potential destruction of a stunning mural by Hungarian artist George Mayer-Marton, housed in a Salford school set for demolition. Recent expert opinions suggest the artwork, forgotten behind a layer of plaster since the 1990s, could be salvaged. The Twentieth Century Society has joined SAVE Britain's Heritage in backing a listing bid to Historic England. The mural, titled "The Five Joyful Mysteries of the Virgin's Rosary," was created in 1954 and is noted for being the only known surviving work by Mayer-Marton using the true fresco technique. The council, while acknowledging the mural’s significance, cites the hefty £400,000 cost for its removal and restoration as a major hurdle. Mayor's great-nephew, Nick Braithwaite, is leading the appeal, arguing for national recognition of the piece. With bulldozers already scheduled for demolition, time is of the essence to secure the mural's future and find it a new home. Historic England is expected to announce a recommendation soon regarding its listing.
