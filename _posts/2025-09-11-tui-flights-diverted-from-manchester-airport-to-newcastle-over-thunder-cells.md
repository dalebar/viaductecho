Two TUI flights were diverted from Manchester Airport today due to severe weather, including heavy rain, thunder, and lightning. They were rerouted to Newcastle Airport as 'thunder cells' created challenging landing conditions. One flight, a Royal Jordanian service from Amman, was treated as an emergency due to low fuel and was granted priority landing, landing safely just before 2.30pm. The airport confirmed that normal operations resumed shortly afterward.
