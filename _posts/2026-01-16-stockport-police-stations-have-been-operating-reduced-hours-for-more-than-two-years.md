Many police stations in Greater Manchester have been operating on reduced hours for over a year due to staffing issues, including vacancies and sick leave. In areas like Stockport, some stations have had limited hours for more than two years, and those in Manchester and Oldham for about 18 months. Councillors have expressed concerns that this is unacceptable and could strain police services in the community. Oldham's councillor, Sam Al-Hamdani, highlighted the challenges residents face trying to visit the station during standard working hours. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) acknowledged the situation but assured that their neighbourhood teams remain active in the community, emphasising that residents can still contact them online or in person. Overall, there’s a push from local councillors for improvements in service delivery to better support public safety.
