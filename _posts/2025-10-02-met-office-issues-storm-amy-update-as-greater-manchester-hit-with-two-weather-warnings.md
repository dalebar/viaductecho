Storm Amy is kicking off the season with a bang, and the Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for wind and rain across the UK, including Greater Manchester. The storm is expected to develop quickly on Friday, bringing gusts of 50-60 mph inland and potentially 70-80 mph in some areas. Heavy rain, particularly in western Scotland, could lead to localised flooding, with rainfall exceeding 30-50mm in just a few hours. 

There are yellow and amber warnings in place, with the yellow warning for wind lasting until late Saturday, alerting residents to potential disruptions. A separate rain warning also takes effect on Friday, signalling travel issues and risk of flooding in northern England and beyond. 

The more severe amber wind warning for northern and western Scotland warns of gusts over 95 mph, with associated dangers like power cuts and travel disruption. Meteorologists advise keeping an eye on updates as the situation evolves, ensuring everyone stays safe during this impactful autumn storm.
