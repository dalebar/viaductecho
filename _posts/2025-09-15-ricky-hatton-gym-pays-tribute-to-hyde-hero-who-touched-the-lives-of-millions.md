Staff at Hatton Health and Fitness gym in Hyde have paid heartfelt tribute to founder Ricky Hatton, who inspired countless people during his life. Opened by Muhammad Ali in 2009, the gym has hosted boxing legends like Tyson Fury and David Haye. Following Ricky's untimely passing on September 14, the gym closed for the day as a mark of respect. In a touching Instagram statement, the team expressed their grief, noting Ricky was more than just a champion boxer but a remarkable person who influenced many lives. His legacy, they believe, will continue to uplift others. Ricky's brother, Matthew, shared a poignant tribute on social media, saying, “I love you Richard. See you on the other side X.” Stars from across sport and music, including Manny Pacquiao and Liam Gallagher, have also honoured Ricky, underlining the profound impact he had both locally and globally. He was just 46 when he passed away, with police confirming no suspicious circumstances.
