Stephanie Davies, a lollipop lady who tragically died after being hit by a bus outside Seedley County Primary School in Salford in 2006, has been posthumously honoured almost 20 years later with the Elizabeth Emblem. Her sisters, Janette and Diane, expressed immense pride upon learning of the award and got the chance to celebrate her life at Number 10 Downing Street, where they met the Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister. The emblem acknowledges public servants who have lost their lives in the line of duty and is a civilian counterpart to the Elizabeth Cross. Stephanie’s family views the recognition as not just an honour for her, but also a reflection of the vital role lollipop ladies play in safeguarding children. The tragic incident occurred as she was working, and her family continues to grapple with the loss, while cherishing her memory. The emblem will feature her name and will be presented by a member of the royal family in due course. In total, 53 recipients will be honoured this month.
