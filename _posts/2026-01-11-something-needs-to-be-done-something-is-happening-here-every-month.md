Residents in Bolton are expressing their outrage over a "dangerous" stretch of Wigan Road, where a tragic head-on collision early on Sunday led to the deaths of four individuals, including three young men and a man in his 50s. The accident occurred at around 1am, involving a red Seat Leon and a grey Citroen C4 Picasso, with the Seat allegedly in the wrong lane at the time of impact. Local folks are calling for immediate action, like speed cameras or bumps, citing ongoing issues with speeding and previous crashes on the road, especially near a children’s play park. Bolton councillor Ayyub Patel shared his condolences and praised the emergency services' quick response. Greater Manchester Police are currently investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.
