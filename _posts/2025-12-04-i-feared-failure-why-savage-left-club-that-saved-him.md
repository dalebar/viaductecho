If things don't go well this season, someone’s gotta leave the club. Macclesfield Town hit a rough patch when they got expelled from the National League and ended up facing a High Court case in September 2020. Local businessman Smethurst swooped in and bought the club a month later. Interestingly, like Adele’s “Someone Like You,” this tale mixes themes of love, loss, and moving on. Though Savage is no longer with Macclesfield, his influence off the pitch will still be remembered as part of the club's journey. Smethurst himself shared that when he took over, he was battling personal demons, nearing a life-altering crisis. When he announced his step down in October 2025, he admitted he’d struggled without Savage by his side.
