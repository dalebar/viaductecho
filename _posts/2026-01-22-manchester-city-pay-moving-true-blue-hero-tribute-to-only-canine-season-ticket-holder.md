Manchester City have paid a heartfelt tribute to Simba, a brave epilepsy seizure alert dog and the club's only canine season ticket holder, who sadly passed away at 12. Simba, alongside his owner Lynn Ratcliffe, witnessed City secure 18 trophies, including the historic Treble. Trained by Support Dogs, his alerts allowed Lynn to live independently and enjoy City matches without worry. The club's matchday programme features a tribute, celebrating Simba as a "true-blue hero" and a "lifesaver" who worked diligently by Lynn’s side for nine years. Lynn reflects on their bond, expressing her heartache over losing such a remarkable companion, while also sharing that her new dog, Barnby, is adjusting to the loss. In honour of Simba, City donated a signed Bernardo Silva shirt for a raffle at her supporters’ club. Lynn plans to scatter Simba’s ashes in meaningful spots, reminding everyone of their special time together. It's a lovely gesture from the club, which has supported Lynn through this tough time. More about Support Dogs and their work is available on their website.
