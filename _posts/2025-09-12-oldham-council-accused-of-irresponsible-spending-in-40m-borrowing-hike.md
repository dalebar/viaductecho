Oldham's council is facing backlash over its spending habits, with critics accusing the Labour-led administration of being ‘irresponsible’ due to increased borrowing. The net borrowing rose by £43m to £187m, raising concerns about budget overruns on significant projects like the Old Library and Spindles shopping centre. The Lib Dem opposition claims the Labour group is risking further borrowing without staying within budget, citing how the Old Library project cost has ballooned from £16m to over £30m, while Spindles has jumped from £69m to over £80m. However, Coun Abdul Jabbar, the council’s deputy leader, defended their track record, asserting claims are ‘incorrect’ and explaining that initial phases of projects were completed within budget before expanding their scope. He mentioned that the council’s financial operations remain within established limits and emphasised the success of ongoing projects, anticipating benefits for residents when the Old Library reopens later this year.
