BeActive in Trafford, located in Davyhulme, has landed a 25-year lease to enhance its offerings across south Manchester. Catering predominantly to the over 50s, it provides a variety of services, including a gym, fitness classes, and low-impact sports like walking football and cricket. A key feature is its Pulmonary and Cardiac rehabilitation programme, which supports clients with life-limiting conditions through exercise and tailored sports. Members like retired teacher Brendan and Dean, who faced severe health challenges, credit the centre with transforming their lives. 

The centre also partners with Egerton College, helping students develop skills in a supportive environment through a newly opened cafeteria. Centre manager Andy Brooks emphasises that volunteer support is crucial, as most services are run by volunteers, with any income reinvested back into the centre. Despite facing low funding, BeActive remains optimistic, providing a vital safe space for individuals navigating mental health challenges, particularly those in retirement.
