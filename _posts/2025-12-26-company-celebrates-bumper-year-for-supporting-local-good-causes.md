High Peak Comps has had a brilliant year giving back to the community, supporting various local charities and initiatives across 2025. They've donated to mental health charities, provided prizes for schools, and even furnished staff rooms at Stepping Hill Hospital with microwaves and toys for children. Notable contributions include £155 for a charity walk supporting Mentell, £150 for Seashell Trust, and prizes like AirPods for Signpost Stockport for Carers. In October, they helped Christ the King School in Macclesfield with reading resources and provided art supplies for the Macclesfield Community Art Space. They also supported local foodbanks and charities in Congleton. 

To cap it all off, High Peak Comps is running a massive £100,000 Christmas prize draw, with tickets at just 99p. The draw closes on Christmas Day with the winner announced live on their Facebook page. It's a great way for the community to get involved and potentially change someone’s life!
