Residents around the 'Secret Lake', between Levenshulme and Reddish, are rallying against plans to develop the natural area into a housing estate, which could include 109 houses and 91 apartments. The lake is seen as a cherished local haven, with community efforts maintaining its wild charm for generations. Campaigners fear that the proposed development would lead to the destruction of vital green space, exacerbate local traffic issues, and potentially result in unaffordable housing prices, contrary to the needs of residents. Northern Group, the developer, claims the plans consider community input and aim to improve the area, proposing recreational facilities and more accessible spaces. However, local sentiment strongly favours preserving the Secret Lake as a crucial environmental area. With a council decision expected by April 10, the community remains adamant about protecting this beloved spot.
