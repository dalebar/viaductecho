Andy Burnham has expressed disappointment over delays to the high-speed railway project connecting Manchester and Liverpool, which he had hoped would be a highlight of Keir Starmer's Labour Conference speech. The line, intended to stop at Warrington and Manchester Airport, is seen as a crucial project for the north-west, likened to the Elizabeth Line in London. The construction has been put on hold for budget reviews to prevent rising costs similar to HS2. Burnham emphasised the urgent need for improved infrastructure in Greater Manchester, which he argues is struggling to keep pace with its rapid growth. He noted that while projects in the south are moving forward, Manchester seems neglected. Government officials have reassured that they remain committed to Northern Powerhouse Rail and will share plans soon. Alongside the railway, Burnham is linking the project to improvements at Manchester Piccadilly station and additional tram and train connections.
