Bury FC has paid tribute to Joan Curtis, a beloved former staff member who dedicated nearly 50 years to the club. Joan, who passed away in her eighties, was well-known among Shakers fans and came from a family with deep ties to the club—her father played for Bury before WWII. She started as a bingo ticket seller in 1972, later taking on a full-time role in the commercial department. Even after the club was expelled from the football league in 2019, she worked unpaid to support its potential revival. Joan’s family is also closely connected to the club, with her son Michael serving as groundsman and her daughter Lynne as commercial secretary. The club expressed its heartfelt condolences, noting that the family collectively contributed over 100 years of service. Fans have shared their sadness and fond memories, highlighting her legacy as a true club legend.
