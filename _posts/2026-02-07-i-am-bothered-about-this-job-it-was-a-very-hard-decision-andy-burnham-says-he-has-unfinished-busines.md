Andy Burnham's feeling a bit of 'unfinished business' in Westminster but is still committed to serving as Greater Manchester mayor for the next two years. He recently aimed to stand as Labour's candidate in the Gorton and Denton by-election, sparked by Andrew Gwynne's resignation, but was blocked by the Labour NEC. In a chat with Oldham Community Radio, Burnham expressed concerns about a divisive new political climate and highlighted his dedication to Greater Manchester. He praised local initiatives like the Bee Network and Oldham's regeneration projects, while sharing anecdotes, including his family influence on decisions and his love for music, especially bands like The Smiths. Acknowledging the turbulent times, he reasserted his commitment to championing the region, with an eye on possibly running for mayor again in 2028. Overall, he's focused on building a collaborative vision for the area, confident about its future.
