Christmas Day in Greater Manchester wrapped up with a decent, if windy, day for outdoor activities, though those dreaming of a white Christmas were left wanting. The weather forecast from the Met Office indicates a dry, cold night ahead, with temperatures dropping to around 1C, but feeling colder due to wind chill, possibly reaching -3C in Oldham. Moving into Boxing Day, expect clear skies and a sunnier day, hitting highs of 7C and almost no chance of rain. Wind gusts will ease off later tonight, making way for calmer weather. However, the rest of the year looks a bit gloomy, with overcast skies expected from December 27 to New Year’s Eve. Monday might offer a bit of sunshine and milder temps around 6C-7C, with Tuesday night being the chilliest, dipping to 0C in some spots. So, keep the warm layers handy!
