An inquest revealed that 'fear' and a ‘lack of confidence’ among medical staff might have impacted the care of 34-year-old Jennifer Cahill, who tragically died following a complicated home birth in Prestwich. She and her newborn, Agnes, faced severe complications; Agnes was born not breathing and passed away four days later, while Jennifer suffered a postpartum haemorrhage resulting in multi-organ failure. Doctors discussed her previous pregnancy complications, but she believed she was no longer considered high-risk after being referred back to midwifery care. The inquest highlighted issues in communication and a lack of preparedness among attending paramedics, with an internal review indicating they were using outdated systems that didn’t adequately flag the urgency of the situation. There’s a push for more training for paramedics in maternity situations, and a new dedicated home birth team at Wythenshawe has been established to improve care. The inquest continues as the circumstances surrounding this heartbreaking case are further examined.
