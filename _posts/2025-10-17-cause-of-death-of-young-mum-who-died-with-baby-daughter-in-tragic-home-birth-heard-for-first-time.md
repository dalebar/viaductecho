The inquest into the tragic deaths of Jennifer Cahill and her newborn daughter, Agnes, is ongoing at Rochdale Coroners' Court. Jennifer, 34, died the day after giving birth at her Prestwich home in June 2024, never holding her daughter, who lived for just four days. Pathologist Lisa Barker testified that Jennifer's cause of death was multi-organ failure due to cardiac arrest from postpartum haemorrhage, mentioning fluid in her chest and a tear in her vagina.

Evidence revealed Jennifer sought advice on Facebook about home births, but the group claimed not to give medical advice. Emergency services described their response as intense, with paramedics noting Agnes showed initial signs of life after resuscitation efforts. However, they reported a deterioration in Jennifer's health, with one paramedic acknowledging that ideally she would have received more medical observations but respected her wish for privacy. Despite their efforts, which included taking Agnes to hospital while Jennifer remained at home, it highlighted challenges faced during the emergency response. The inquest continues next week.
