Pep Guardiola, Manchester City's manager, is considering his options for the starting goalkeeper ahead of the derby against Manchester United, emphasising that "everyone will be involved" this season. He faces a decision on whether to start Â£26m signing Donnarumma or stick with Trafford, who has been in goal for the first three matches. Donnarumma's arrival suggests a change from the traditional sweeper-keeper style of Ederson. Meanwhile, striker Erling Haaland is riding high after netting five goals for Norway in an 11-1 victory over Moldova during the World Cup qualifiers.
