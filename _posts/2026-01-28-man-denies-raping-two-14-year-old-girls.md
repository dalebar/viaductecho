Sultani Bakatash, a 28-year-old Afghan national, appeared in Bolton Crown Court via videolink from Forest Bank Prison, denying charges of raping two 14-year-old girls in December last year. He also denied two charges of sexual assault by penetration and one sexual assault. Using a Dari interpreter, he maintained his innocence during the proceedings. Represented by Paul Becker, with Harriet Lavin for the prosecution, the case was adjourned until a management hearing on February 12, while a five-day trial is set to start on June 8. Bakatash has been in the UK for two years and holds indefinite leave to remain, along with his immediate family. After the latest hearing, he was remanded in custody.
