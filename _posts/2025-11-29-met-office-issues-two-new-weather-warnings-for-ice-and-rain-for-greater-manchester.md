The Met Office has issued two yellow weather warnings for Greater Manchester. First, there's a warning for ice from 10pm tonight until 9am tomorrow, covering a broad region. Expect temperatures to drop below freezing, leading to icy conditions on untreated surfaces that could make travel tricky. 

Secondly, another yellow warning for rain kicks in at midnight on Monday and lasts until 3am on Tuesday. Heavy rain is likely, with up to 120 mm possible in some areas, particularly on higher ground. This downpour could cause flooding in homes and businesses, plus disruption on roads and public transport. Strong winds are also expected to accompany the rain, especially near coasts and elevated areas. Stay safe and keep an eye on the forecast!
