Quaffers, a legendary nightclub in Stockport, opened in 1978 and hosted big names like Shirley Bassey and Take That over its two-decade run. With a capacity of 2,600, it featured a hydraulic stage and a basement kitchen serving hot beef barm cakes, attracting the fashionable crowd of the '70s and '80s. Owned by Dougie Flood, who was known for several popular nightclubs, Quaffers had its last performance in December 1998 and was demolished in 2004. 

The club was famous for its strict dress code, rejecting patrons for styles deemed inappropriate, such as white socks or certain hairstyles. Controversies made headlines, including a court case where a Christmas dinner party was denied entrance due to a guest’s hairstyle. Quaffers also hosted cheeky events like wet t-shirt contests and was remembered fondly by patrons for its atmosphere and nostalgic nights out. Dougie Flood’s son Ian reflected on how the club left a lasting impression on many, describing it as a well-ahead-of-its-time venue filled with wonderful memories.
