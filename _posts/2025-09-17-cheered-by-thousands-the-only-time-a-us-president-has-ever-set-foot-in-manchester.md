Donald Trump kicked off a historic second state visit to the UK on September 16, landing at London Stansted Airport. Over three days, heâ€™s staying in Windsor Castle, having a state banquet with King Charles III, and paying respects to Queen Elizabeth II. The tradition of US presidents visiting the UK dates back to Woodrow Wilson, who was the first to make the crossing in 1918. He was warmly welcomed by huge crowds in London and Manchester, where he spoke at the Free Trade Hall, highlighting the importance of trade and goodwill. Wilson, who considered Manchester to have familiar qualities to American cities, received the Honorary Freedom of the City. His visit symbolised a hopeful new era for US-UK relations after WWI, and his words on peace and cooperation laid the groundwork for a strong bond that still exists today. Remarkably, Wilson never returned to the UK after that trip and is still the only US President to have been honoured with Manchester's freedom.
