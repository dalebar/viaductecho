Stockport County is launching a fab initiative to distribute 4,000 free PE kits to children across the borough this September, ensuring every child can participate in sports, no matter their financial situation. This 'Kits by County' scheme began in 2024, with 3,000 kits already given out, and aims for a total of 12,000. The club’s efforts have reportedly boosted PE participation, helping kids who previously missed lessons due to stigma to engage fully once again. Funded by fans (£2 from each shirt sale goes to the initiative) and other donations, the goal is to promote inclusivity, health, and opportunity for all children in Stockport. Owner Mark Stott emphasised the importance of community support, while goalkeeper Corey Addai shared personal stories about the significance of access to sports. The club is encouraging other football organisations to join in and help out their communities too.
