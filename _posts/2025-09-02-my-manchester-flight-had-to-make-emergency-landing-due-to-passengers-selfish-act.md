Zara shared a wild story about her flight from Manchester that had to make an emergency landing at Gatwick due to a passenger smoking a cigarette, leading to chaos on board. Her TikTok video of the incident went viral, racking up over 59,000 views, as many chimed in, criticising the "selfish" smoker for causing disruption. The flight was delayed overnight after the crew's working hours were exceeded, but the airline provided accommodation. Zara explained that smoking on planes is a serious breach of safety rules, with potential consequences like emergency landings if it creates smoke or leads to confrontations. It's a reminder of the importance of following airline regulations while travelling.
