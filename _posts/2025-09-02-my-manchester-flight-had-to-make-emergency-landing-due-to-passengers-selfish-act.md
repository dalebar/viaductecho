Zara shared a wild tale of how her flight from Manchester to Morocco had to make an emergency landing at Gatwick due to a passenger's selfish act of smoking on board. In a viral TikTok clip, she captured the chaotic scene as emergency services boarded the plane surrounded by police and fire crews. The incident left her and other passengers gobsmacked, especially since it's not the first time a diversion has happened from Manchester. Afterward, Zara revealed that passengers were required to stay overnight in Gatwick due to crew working hours, but the airline covered their accommodation. Many commenters echoed their frustration, suggesting stricter penalties for such behaviour. Smoking on planes is a serious breach of rules, as it can lead to evacuations and emergency landings for safety reasons. Zara's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of following flight regulations while travelling.
