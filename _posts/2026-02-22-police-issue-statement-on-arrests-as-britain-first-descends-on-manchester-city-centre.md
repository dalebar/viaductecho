Today in Manchester, police arrested 11 individuals during a protest by the far-right party Britain First, which advocated for "remigration and mass deportations." The gathering drew hundreds, and counter-protests occurred, including one featuring former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at Piccadilly Gardens. Arrests included suspicions of public order offences, assaulting emergency workers, and breaching dispersal notices. Some individuals have since been de-arrested and given dispersal notices. Greater Manchester Police reported a significant operation was in place to manage the protests while ensuring public safety. They noted that various demonstrations proceeded peacefully, thanks to coordination with organisers. Assistant Chief Constable Rick Jackson highlighted efforts to enable safe expression of views without major disruptions, reflecting Manchester's commitment to lawfully allow public dissent while keeping the city safe and orderly.
