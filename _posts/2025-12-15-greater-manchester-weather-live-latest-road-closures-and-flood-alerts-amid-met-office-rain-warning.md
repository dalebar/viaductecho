Greater Manchester is facing a flood alert across Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, and Bury due to heavy rain, with the Met Office warning in effect until late tonight. The Environment Agency has cautioned that rising river levels may lead to flooding, urging residents in affected areas to be prepared. 

Travel disruptions are likely, with numerous flights delayed at Manchester Airport and road issues reported, including significant congestion on the M602 and M61. The Met Office predicts up to 60 mm of rain today, so those planning to travel should stay updated on their journey.

Flood Duty Manager Jonathan Day emphasised the dangers of driving through floodwater, as even a small amount can overwhelm vehicles. He also reminded everyone to check their flood risk and stay informed about the ongoing situation.
