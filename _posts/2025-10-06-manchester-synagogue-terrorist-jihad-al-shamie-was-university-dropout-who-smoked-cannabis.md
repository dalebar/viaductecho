Jihad Al-Shamie, the attacker at a Manchester synagogue, has been revealed as a 35-year-old Syrian-born man who dropped out of university after a year. Reports suggest he smoked cannabis and had a troubled personal life, including infidelity and a quick remarriage. While on bail for an alleged rape, he groomed a young woman, pushing extremist views and pressuring her for marriage, which she resisted. Following a 20-year-old incident that left him with brain damage, he became reclusive. He was shot dead by police on-site after the attack on Yom Kippur, which resulted in the deaths of two men and injuries to four others. The investigation is ongoing, with counter-terror police actively pursuing leads and detaining suspects connected to the attack. The police watchdog is also looking into the officers' use of lethal force during the incident.
