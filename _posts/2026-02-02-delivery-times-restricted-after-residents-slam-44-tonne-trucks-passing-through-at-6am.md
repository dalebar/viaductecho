The council has approved plans for Timetoken Ltd to operate 11 industrial units at Victoria Works, Bolton, albeit with restrictions on delivery hours to address local concerns. Established as a textile mill in the 1800s, the site has changed hands a few times and is now home to three tenants. Residents, including Graham Jones, raised objections mainly about noise and heavy vehicle traffic, highlighting issues with road safety and previous accidents. They urged the council to enforce stricter delivery hours, similar to a nearby builder’s merchant, citing historical practices when the site operated as Firwood Paint & Varnish. In response, the planning committee approved the application with conditions, limiting deliveries to weekdays from 7.30am to 6pm and Saturdays from 8am to 2pm, while prohibiting deliveries on Sundays and Bank Holidays.
