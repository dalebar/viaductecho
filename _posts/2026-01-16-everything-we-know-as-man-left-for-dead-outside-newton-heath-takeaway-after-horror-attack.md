A 64-year-old man was brutally attacked outside Dixy Chicken takeaway in Newton Heath, Manchester, on New Year's Day, leaving him critically injured. Following a night out, he was punched and kicked while on the ground, causing serious injuries including a fractured skull, jaw, ribs, and a collapsed lung. Emergency services found him unconscious around 1am and he was initially treated at North Manchester General Hospital before being airlifted to Manchester Royal Infirmary. His family felt he was 'left for dead' after the assault. Police believe multiple men were involved but no arrests have been made yet, and the motive remains unclear. Greater Manchester Police are asking for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward, reminding the public they can also report anonymously to Crimestoppers. The family is deeply upset as the grandfather continues to recover from his injuries.
