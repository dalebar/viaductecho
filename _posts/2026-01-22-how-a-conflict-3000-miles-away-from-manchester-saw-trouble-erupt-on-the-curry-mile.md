Last night, things kicked off on Manchester's Curry Mile during a protest about the conflict in Syria, which started peacefully but turned chaotic. A large group of demonstrators began damaging cars and property and clashed with police after the march reached Wilmslow Road. Eyewitness footage showed crowds pushing towards officers and scuffles breaking out, resulting in some windows being smashed. A dispersal order was issued by the police to clear the area, and although there were no arrests made, officers are reviewing CCTV to identify those involved in the disorder. Local businesses, like a restaurant and a jewellers, reported feeling overwhelmed by the sudden violence. Superintendent Stephen Wiggins emphasised that they aim to support peaceful protests but will crack down on disorderly behaviour. Meanwhile, the situation in Syria remains tense, with a new ceasefire announced between government troops and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces after a recent escalation in clashes.
