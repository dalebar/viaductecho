Big changes are on the horizon for Stockport train station as part of a 'major redevelopment' project backed by over £4m of government funding. The plan focuses on improving access and usability at the bustling hub, which connects Manchester and London. Local MP Navendu Mishra and Edgeley councillors have highlighted the station's need for investment to enhance its appeal. Proposed upgrades include better pedestrian connections and a new ramp from Thompson Street for easier access, as well as improvements to platforms and services for commuters. This collaborative project involves Stockport council, Transport for Greater Manchester, Network Rail, and Avanti West Coast. Mark Roberts, leader of the council, emphasised the station's significance on Europe’s busiest rail line and its potential to spur job creation and investment in the area. This redevelopment is part of a broader £1bn regeneration scheme in Stockport town centre, which includes a new transport interchange and plans for new homes and businesses.
