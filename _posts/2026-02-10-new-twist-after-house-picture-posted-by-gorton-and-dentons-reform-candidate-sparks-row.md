A photo shared by Reform UK candidate Matt Goodwin in Denton sparked controversy online. He posted an image of himself outside a house adorned with Reform placards, but later a user claimed he had photoshopped the posters into the image and never rang the doorbell. The user shared a different photo showing the house without the posters. However, the Press Association (PA) fact-checked this claim and found that the user's photo showed signs of editing too. Anomaly signs, like a disjointed brick wall and a misshaped door, suggested tampering. Despite the absence of large placards, a small Reform sticker was still visible in the bay window. A Google Streetview image from June 2025 confirmed the presence of this sticker and showed normal brickwork and different door details compared to the edited photo. So, both sides seem to have questionable images!
