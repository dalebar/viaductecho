Tram services on the Salford route are back up and running after a morning hiccup on January 30. The Eccles line was shut down due to a damaged overhead line discovered around 5:30am, leading to disruptions for passengers. By 2pm, power was restored near Salford Quays, and trams resumed service between Eccles and Ashton-under-Lyne, although with some minor delays. Ian Davies from TfGM expressed apologies for the inconvenience caused and noted that specialist engineers worked hard to fix the issue. They're expecting services to normalise as the afternoon rush kicks in.
