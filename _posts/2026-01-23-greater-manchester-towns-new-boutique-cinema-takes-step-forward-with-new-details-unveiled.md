A new boutique cinema, The Northern Light Cinema, is set to open in Trafford in March, run by the Mundin family who also manage The Savoy in Heaton Moor and the Northern Light in Sale. They're applying to Trafford Council to convert a unit in Stretford’s town centre, specifically on Pinnington Lane, where Stretford Mall used to be. The cinema will feature three accessible screens, along with a lounge, foyer, ticket office, and a bar serving top-notch wine, local craft beer, homemade cakes, and fresh popcorn. The goal is to foster a "warm, welcoming cultural hub" for the community, showcasing new releases, family films, cult classics, and live events. This cinema is part of a larger redevelopment for Stretford Mall, which also includes new shops and restaurants, aimed at attracting more visitors to the town centre. Local leaders express excitement, sharing that this venue will enhance the vibrant community and overall amenities in Stretford.
