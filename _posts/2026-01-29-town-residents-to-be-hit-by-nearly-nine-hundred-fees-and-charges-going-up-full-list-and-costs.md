Oldham Council is set to raise almost 900 service charges and fees to tackle a £20 million budget gap for the 2026/27 financial year. Charges for services like new bins, cemetery fees, marriages, car parks, and pest control will increase, with most seeing about a 10% hike, while some could rise by up to 200%. For example, wedding costs at Chadderton Town Hall will increase significantly, with Sunday ceremonies going up by £110 to £663. Cemetery plots will rise by £119. However, fees for taxi drivers will be reduced. 

This move aligns Oldham’s charges more closely with neighbouring boroughs, as some services have been underpriced. Other measures to balance the budget include increasing council tax and a new fair share policy for those in temporary accommodation. Overall, this decision reflects the council's attempts to respond effectively to funding challenges while also creating a fairer pricing structure.
