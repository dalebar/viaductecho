Stockport Masonic Guildhall has been beautifully refurbished, restoring its Victorian charm since its opening in 1868. After years of disrepair, the extensive renovation—initiated about seven years ago—is nearly complete, enhancing both accessibility and visual appeal for various events, including weddings and festivals. Some interior rooms are still being finished, but the transformation is already making a significant impact. Recently, the Guildhall welcomed visitors during an open day, allowing the public to explore the revamped space. Cheshire Freemason Andy Ferri highlighted its dual role as a Freemasonry venue and a hub for community events. The Guildhall has a rich history, having served many purposes over the years, including acting as a refuge for evacuee children during WWII. Upcoming events, like the Mind Body Spirit festival, showcase the Guildhall’s vibrant role in Stockport’s cultural scene. The restoration was carried out by Stone Central and Touchstone Glazing, marking a new chapter in the building’s storied legacy.
