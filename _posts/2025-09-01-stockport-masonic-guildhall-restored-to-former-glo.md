The Stockport Masonic Guildhall has been beautifully refurbished, bringing back its Victorian charm from 1868. Located on Wellington Road South, the once dilapidated building underwent a major restoration over the past seven years thanks to the Freemasons. While some upper floor rooms are still being worked on, the updates have made the Guildhall more visually striking and accessible for a variety of events. Along with hosting Freemason activities, the venue is popular for weddings and festivals, like the upcoming Mind Body Spirit event featuring workshops and speakers. The Guildhall has a rich history, having been a Sunday School before becoming home to the Stockport Freemasons in 1932, and even served as shelter for evacuee children during WWII. An open day showcased the renovations, with local leaders expressing excitement about its future as a community hub.
