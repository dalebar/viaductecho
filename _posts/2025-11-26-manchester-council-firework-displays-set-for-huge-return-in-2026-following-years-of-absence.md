Manchester's council-run firework displays are making a comeback for Bonfire Night 2026 after years off due to the pandemic. The displays, which used to be a part of local festivities until 2020, were sidelined in favour of a broader range of community events. Many families missed the free fireworks, so it's a relief to see them return thanks to increased government funding. Council Leader Bev Craig expressed her delight, highlighting the importance of free community events for bringing people together. The council expects to secure better funding next year, allowing for both the fireworks and other community initiatives. More details will be confirmed in upcoming council documents, but it’s looking bright for a brilliant Bonfire Night in Manchester!
