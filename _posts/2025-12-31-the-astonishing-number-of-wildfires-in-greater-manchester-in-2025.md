In 2025, Greater Manchester faced a sharp increase in wildfires, hitting the highest number of incidents in four years. Fire services across England battled around 27,000 grassland, woodland, and crop fires during an exceptionally warm spring and summer, with some services experiencing their busiest spring ever. A drought was declared in various areas due to prolonged dry weather, contributing to a surge in wildfires. In Greater Manchester alone, there were 1,173 wildfires from March to May 2025, a dramatic jump from 155 in 2024. Summer also saw 501 fires, making it a total of over 1,172 more fires compared to the previous year. The Met Office noted that 2025 was on track to be the UK’s warmest year since records began, fuelled by ongoing high-pressure weather systems and record temperatures. This drastic rise in wildfires reflects a worrying trend linked to climate conditions.
