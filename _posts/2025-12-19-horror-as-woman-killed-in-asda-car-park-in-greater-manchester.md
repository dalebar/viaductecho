A tragic incident occurred in Oldham when a 78-year-old woman was hit by a van in an Asda car park on December 18. The woman was returning to her car when a Peugeot Expert, driven by a motorist exiting the car park, struck her. Despite the swift response from emergency services, she sustained severe injuries and later died. Police cordoned off a large area of the car park while the Greater Manchester Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit began looking into the collision. They’re urging anyone with information, including witnesses or dashcam footage, to get in touch. Folks can reach the SCIU at 0161 856 4741 or via GMP’s Live Chat, quoting log 253 from November 23, 2025. You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111.
