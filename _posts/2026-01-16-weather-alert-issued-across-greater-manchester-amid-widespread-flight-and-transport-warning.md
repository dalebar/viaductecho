Greater Manchester's been hit with a yellow fog warning from the Met Office, set to start 8pm Thursday night and lasting until 7am Friday. Heavy fog could bring travel disruptions, affecting flights, trains, and buses, especially in areas like Bury, Bolton, Wigan, and Manchester. Visibility may drop below 100 metres, so it's wise to sort your travel plans ahead—check road conditions, allow extra time, and verify that your fog lights are working. The warning extends to other parts of the north west too, so keep an eye on updates from your travel providers. Stay safe out there!
