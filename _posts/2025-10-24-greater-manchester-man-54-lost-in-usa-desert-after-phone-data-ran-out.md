Jamie Oakford, a 54-year-old from Oldham, had a terrifying experience in the Texan desert when his Vodafone roaming service cut out, leaving him stranded without GPS or phone service. After driving from Dallas in search of a stargazing spot, he received a message about nearing the limit of his roaming package, and soon after was completely disconnected. Despite being aware he could call 911, his situation didn’t qualify for immediate assistance. Thankfully, rangers located him using his rental car's tracking device after four anxious hours. Although he enjoyed the stars while waiting, the ordeal shook him up, leading to a $200 (£150) fee for the ranger service. Once back in the UK, Jamie lodged a complaint with Vodafone, which informed him about a spend cap on his package that he hadn’t previously known about. Vodafone expressed regret over his distress but mentioned that his plan didn't cover roaming in the US. Jamie felt his holiday turned into a nightmare he wouldn't soon forget.
