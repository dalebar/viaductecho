Kath Stephens, an exceptional woman from Stockport, has received a British Citizen Award (BCA) Medal of Honour for her remarkable services to the community. Recognised for her dedication to supporting vulnerable students, Kath volunteers five days a week at her local high school, offering vital assistance, especially for those with SEND. She provides counselling and helps secure quality work experiences for her students, ensuring they have a solid foundation for their futures. Kath also supports local families through charity collections for Hope Central, a foodbank that provides essential supplies. Presented the award by Lisa Hannah from Aldermore Bank, Kath's relentless energy and care have made her a true champion for students, earning her this well-deserved recognition at a ceremony hosted at the Palace of Westminster. The BCA awards, sometimes referred to as the "People's Honours," celebrate individuals who have made outstanding contributions to society.
