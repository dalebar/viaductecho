Merkur Slots Ltd, a German gaming firm, is eyeing the vacant Barclays building in Oldham town centre for a new casino, aiming to bring its basement and ground floor back to life with slot machines and betting games. The Grade-II listed site has been empty since October 2023, attracting little interest from retailers. Merkur has submitted a ‘Change of Use’ application, proposing to convert the former bank into an adult gaming centre, which they believe will boost both day and night-time activity in the area. Located just opposite the Spindles shopping centre and near other similar gaming venues, Merkur stresses that their centres are distinct from betting shops, with a focus on leisure rather than traditional gambling. The venue, if approved, would operate 24/7, staffed and welcoming, alongside some minor exterior tweaks like new signage. The proposal is currently in the public consultation phase before a final decision by planners.
