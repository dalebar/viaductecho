Andy Burnham has issued an apology for the historic homophobia at Greater Manchester Police (GMP), addressing the "unacceptable discrimination" towards the LGBTQ+ community and acknowledging the "pain and suffering" it caused. This comes after the Peter Tatchell Foundation demanded a formal apology for decades of abusive policing. Burnham's letter highlights the disgraceful treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals, contrasting it with the "supportive policies" currently in place at GMP, while acknowledging past failings. Chief Constable Stephen Watson, however, declined to offer a formal apology, expressing that it would make "little or no difference," although he did express regret for not meeting expected standards historically. The Foundation emphasised that many UK police forces have already issued apologies for similar past actions, underscoring a growing recognition of the need for accountability in policing towards the LGBTQ+ community.
