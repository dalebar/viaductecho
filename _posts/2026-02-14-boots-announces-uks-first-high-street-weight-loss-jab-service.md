Boots pharmacies in Greater Manchester have started offering weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy in-store, making it easier for customers to access these treatments. The service, which is being trialled in 17 locations across the UK, including the Stamford Quarter in Altrincham, allows people to drop by for jabs during their lunch breaks after a consultation with a pharmacist. This marks a shift from the previous online-only access to weight loss medications. The drugs are GLP-1 receptor agonists, designed to reduce appetite. While GPs can prescribe Mounjaro on the NHS under strict eligibility criteria, Boots aims to provide a more both convenient health route through in-person chats and online services. Jamie Kerruish from Boots emphasised the importance of accessible healthcare for those affected by obesity. Appointments for this new service can be booked online or via walk-ins. Other participating locations include stores in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, and more.
