Everything Everything may not be originally from Manchester, but they embody the city's essence. Bassist Jeremy Pritchard reflects on their identity, saying they feel liberated from typical Mancunian expectations. The band emerged from Salford University, releasing six albums and drawing inspiration from the radical spirit of Manchester music, which embraces diversity over a singular style. They recently celebrated their third album, *Get to Heaven*, a decade after its release, with a vibrant performance at Aviva Studios. Jeremy acknowledges the challenges the band faced while creating the album, which tackled heavy themes yet resonated deeply with fans. The lyrics reflect on social issues of the time, remaining relevant today. Jeremy also shares his fondness for Manchester's music scene, highlighting accessible venues like Night and Day. As for his musical influences, The Smiths hold a special place in his heart. He appreciates Manchester's beautiful architecture and parks, particularly Central Library and Alexandra Park, especially during the autumn. Overall, Everything Everything is proud to be part of Manchester's rich cultural tapestry.
