There’s some buzz about 'squatters' in the old M&S building on Deansgate in Bolton, but it turns out they might actually be film crews using the space, not squatters after all. The council has been keeping an eye on the site, which has been closed since 2023, and found no evidence of anyone breaking in. While some folks have been spotted behind the hoarding, the council plan to work with the Homeless Welfare Team and police to provide support and help clear the area. Bolton’s been nicknamed the 'Hollywood of the North' due to its stunning Victorian and neoclassical architecture, attracting many film and TV productions, including Peaky Blinders and Happy Valley. With the launch of the Bolton Film Office, the town's hoping to become an even bigger player in the filming scene, boasting a load of impressive backdrops for various shows and films.
