Police in Oldham have been given extended powers following reports of violence and anti-social behaviour in the Limeside area. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) activated a Section 60 Order, allowing officers to stop and search people in the vicinity. This measure took effect at 7:48pm last night and lasts until the same time today, with additional officers patrolling the area. Thankfully, no serious injuries have been reported, though a 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of domestic offences as part of ongoing efforts in the area. Inspector Amie Whitehead encourages anyone with concerns to reach out to the police. For the latest updates, residents can sign up for newsletters or follow GMP on their social media platforms.
