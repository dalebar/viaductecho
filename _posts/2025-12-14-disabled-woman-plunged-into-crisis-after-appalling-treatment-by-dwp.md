Sabena Khan, a disabled woman from Bramhall, Stockport, is facing a financial crisis due to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) mishandling her benefits. Suffering from cerebral palsy and rheumatoid arthritis, Sabena relies on care funding from Stockport council, but the DWP mistakenly deemed this funding as her personal savings, resulting in a £200 monthly drop in her income. This error has left her dependent on foodbanks and struggling to afford basic necessities, significantly affecting her mental health. Cheadle MP Tom Morrison has condemned the DWP's treatment of Sabena, stating it’s unacceptable for vulnerable individuals to suffer due to bureaucratic mistakes. He and his office have repeatedly reached out to the DWP for clarity but received little response. Sabena expressed her frustration with the DWP's lack of urgency, emphasising how the situation has deteriorated her quality of life. She wishes for more understanding from the DWP and highlights that her disability limits her ability to work. The council is in talks with the DWP to resolve the issue.
