Andy Burnham's calling on union leaders to get back to the negotiating table and stop the bus strikes, which kicked off today with over 2,000 Unite members walking out due to pay disputes. This four-day strike has heavily disrupted services in Greater Manchester, with around two-thirds of buses cancelled. The Mayor insists reasonable measures to prevent the strikes have been taken and pointed out that proposed pay increases for drivers are quite substantial, along with plans for a standard minimum pay rate by 2028. Passengers are feeling the pinch, with many forced to take pricey Ubers or reschedule appointments. Strikes are set to continue at Stagecoach and Metroline until Monday, and additional strikes are scheduled for September 30 to October 2, as drivers have rejected a 3.5% pay offer. Unite's regional officer placed the blame on employers for not adequately addressing the low pay issue, warning that more strikes could be on the horizon if things donâ€™t change.
