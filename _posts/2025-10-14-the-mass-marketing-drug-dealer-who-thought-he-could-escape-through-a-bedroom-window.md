Diontai Simpson, a 23-year-old drug dealer, used mass marketing techniques to sell heroin, cocaine, and cannabis in Derbyshire and Manchester. He would send multiple messages daily targeting potential customers and even coordinated others to sell drugs for him. His activities were uncovered by Derbyshire police, who initially arrested him after discovering suspected drugs during a vehicle stop. Subsequent searches revealed more drugs and paraphernalia at his property. During a second raid, Simpson tried to escape by jumping out of a window but was later arrested again when he returned to the site. He faced multiple charges related to drug supply and pleaded guilty, receiving a sentence of two years and six months in prison from Derby Crown Court. Derbyshire police highlighted the harmful impact of drug dealing on communities and reaffirmed their commitment to tackling such crimes.
