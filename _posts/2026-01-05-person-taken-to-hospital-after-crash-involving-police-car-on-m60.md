A crash involving a police car on the M60 motorway near Whitefield took place just before 7pm on Sunday (January 4). The incident, which involved three vehicles, led to one person being taken to hospital, though their injuries aren't believed to be serious. Emergency services responded promptly, causing lanes 3 and 4 to close and traffic to be held between junctions 16 and 17 for about an hour, as congestion quickly built up. The motorway re-opened around 8.10pm. Meanwhile, for those wanting to keep up with the best stories from Manchester, the MEN's Features and Perspectives editor Rob Williams offers a weekly highlight reel, so you won't miss out on what's happening in the city.
