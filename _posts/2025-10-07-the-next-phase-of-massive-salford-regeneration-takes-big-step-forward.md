The next stage of a major regeneration project in Salford is underway, with developer ECF proposing up to 185 new apartments near Chapel Street. This is part of the Adelphi Village neighbourhood, aiming for over 800 homes under the £2.5bn Salford Crescent masterplan. The flats will be a mix of one, two, and three-bedroom homes, housed in buildings of five to six storeys, featuring a private courtyard and greenery to boost wildlife. The plans prioritise accessibility with designated disabled parking and cycle storage to promote active travel. Inspired by Salford's industrial heritage, particularly the former Adelphi Iron Works, the project aims to meet local housing needs and foster a sustainable community. Lawrence Myatt from ECF emphasised the importance of transforming this underused site into a vibrant neighbourhood aligned with Salford’s history and future.
