Andrew Gwynne, MP for Gorton and Denton, is expected to resign following the ongoing fallout from the 'Trigger Me Timbers' WhatsApp scandal. Reports suggest his stepping down could facilitate Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's return to Parliament, amidst speculation about Burnham's potential challenge for Labour leadership. Discussions about Mr Gwynne's possible medical retirement have surfaced, hinting at a by-election on May 7, coinciding with local elections. Despite previous commitments to serve his term, sources indicate a deal has been agreed regarding his retirement and pension. Should he resign, Burnham would need to vacate his mayoral role and secure nomination from Labour's National Executive Committee, which may impose an all-female shortlist. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has expressed support for Gwynne, recognising his health struggles and the need for strong candidates to contest any forthcoming by-election. Gwynne’s office has been approached for further comments, but he hasn’t publicly confirmed his intentions yet.
