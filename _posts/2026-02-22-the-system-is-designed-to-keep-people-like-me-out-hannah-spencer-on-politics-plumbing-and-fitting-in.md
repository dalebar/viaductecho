Hannah Spencer, known as 'Hannah the Plumber', is a Green Party candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election. She’s spent her life feeling like an outsider, yet she's determined to challenge the conventional political landscape. During her campaign, she faced criticism for her remarks about divisive politics but stands firm in addressing issues such as immigration, public services, and NHS reform. Hannah emphasises the need for a better understanding of everyday challenges, pushing for legislative changes on issues like tool theft and healthcare accessibility. She advocates for taxing the wealthy to fund public services and returning utilities to public ownership, arguing privatisation hasn’t worked. Despite being up against Labour’s stronghold in the area, she sees evidence of growing support for the Greens and encourages voters to trust their instincts. Away from politics, her experiences with her dogs have shaped her belief in shared human values. If elected, she plans to focus on public service while maintaining her identity as a plumber, aiming to prove that anyone can achieve a political role, regardless of their background.
