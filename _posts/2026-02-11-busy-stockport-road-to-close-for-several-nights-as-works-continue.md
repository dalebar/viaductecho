Work is resuming on Compstall Road in Romiley as part of a £1.8m scheme to enhance cycling and pedestrian access. The project includes a new two-way cycling track and upgraded Romiley Precinct crossing, aimed at making the area safer and more welcoming for walkers and cyclists. Although the project, led by Stockport Council and Transport for Greater Manchester, received initial pushback from local businesses due to lack of notice about the disruptions, continued improvements are underway.

Starting February 16, resurfacing will occur on Compstall Road from 7pm to 6am for five nights, causing various road closures that will be clearly signed for motorists and pedestrians. The council is committed to completing the work with minimal noise during the night and appreciates the community's patience. Cllr Grace Baynham stated that improving transport options would help local businesses and foster a healthier environment moving forward. The project is part of a wider initiative to connect cycling routes through quieter residential streets.
