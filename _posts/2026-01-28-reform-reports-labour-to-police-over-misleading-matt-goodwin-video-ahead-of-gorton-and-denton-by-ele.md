Reform UK has reported Labour to the police over a “misleading” video criticising their candidate, Matt Goodwin, for the Gorton and Denton by-election. The Labour Party shared a video clip of Goodwin that suggested he was denigrating Manchester, while he clarified that he was actually criticising the Tory party during their conference in the city. Goodwin claims Labour has engaged in misinformation and highlighted their actions as deliberate attempts to mislead voters. A Labour spokesperson responded by mocking the situation and accused Goodwin and Reform of dismissing the North, insisting that only Labour can counter what they describe as divisive politics. This comes after Andrew Gwynne, the sitting Labour MP for Gorton and Denton, announced he would not stand for re-election due to health issues, having been suspended from the party previously. Notably, Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, was also blocked by Labour from running in the by-election.
