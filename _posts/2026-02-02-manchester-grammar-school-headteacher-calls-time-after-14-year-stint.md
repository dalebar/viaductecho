Martin Boulton, the headteacher of Manchester Grammar School, is set to retire after 14 years in the role, having joined back in 2013. A former student of the school, he expressed that it’s time for someone new to guide the school’s future development. Boulton, originally from Altrincham, shared that returning as High Master was a chance to give back to a school that had a profound impact on his life. He plans to retire in the summer of 2027 after a rewarding tenure, during which he emphasised inclusivity and championed the bursary campaign to support students from diverse backgrounds. Clare Bolton, chair of governors, praised his leadership, especially through challenging times like the pandemic, and noted the school’s impressive achievements under his guidance. As the search for a new High Master begins, Boulton looks forward to new adventures, including gliding, though he’ll miss the school and its community dearly.
