Jonathan Smith, a Mancunian, decided to escape the rat race of the UK by relocating to Sicily, Italy, after searching for affordable properties online. Initially eyeing Greece, he fell in love with a secluded villa in Mazara del Vallo, which had been abandoned for 20 years and was priced at just €21,500 (£18,000). Despite its derelict state, Jonathan was excited about the size and character of the property. 

Once he moved in, reality hit hard as he faced extensive renovations, quickly learning DIY skills and tackling challenges like language barriers and sourcing materials in a foreign country. He's encountered funny cultural differences and bizarre surprises, but overall, he’s finding the renovation rewarding. 

Jonathan splits his time between the villa and the UK, where his family still resides, but they plan to join him permanently once the home is livable. He's documenting his journey on his YouTube channel, Operation Sicily, sharing successes and mishaps along the way, inspiring others with no experience to take on similar adventures.
