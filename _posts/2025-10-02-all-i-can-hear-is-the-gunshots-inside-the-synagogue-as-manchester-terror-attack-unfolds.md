Members of the Heaton Park Hebrew congregation experienced fear and confusion after being locked inside their synagogue during a terrorist attack on October 2. While gathering for Yom Kippur prayers, police ushered them in as an armed man began attacking innocent people outside. The suspect, who drove his car into the crowd and stabbed multiple victims, was shot dead by police within minutes. Tragically, two people died, and four others were seriously injured. 

Rob Kanter, an inter-faith worker present during the attack, described the initial shock and the importance of continuing prayers despite the chaos. Local resident Rami, who has lived in the multicultural area for years, expressed concern about security and community dynamics.
