The government has given the green light for the Eton Star Academy in Oldham, set to provide opportunities for disadvantaged kids to access top universities. Initially on hold for over a year during a review of free school plans, it’s now managed by Star Academies and backed by Eton College. Coun Arooj Shah expressed enthusiasm about the school’s potential to change lives, promising it will be shaped by community feedback. While a second academy will open in Dudley, plans for a third in Middlesborough are uncertain. There’s been some local pushback on the site's choice at Tommyfield Market, with critics suggesting alternative uses and advocating for vocational courses instead. Despite this, proponents highlight the academy's accessibility via public transport and its role in enhancing social mobility in Oldham. A planning application is expected soon, with more details on admissions to come.
