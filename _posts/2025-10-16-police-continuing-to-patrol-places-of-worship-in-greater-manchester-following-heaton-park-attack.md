Greater Manchester Police (GMP) is stepping up reassurance patrols in response to the recent attack on Heaton Park synagogue. They've been actively patrolling places of worship, especially within Jewish communities, making around 16,000 visits and engaging with community leaders and worshippers. A GMP spokesperson expressed gratitude for the public's support and highlighted their commitment to safety, with officers working 12-hour shifts and cancelling rest days to cover the area. As resources gradually return to normal, GMP remains focused on prioritising the wellbeing of all communities, particularly the Jewish community, to ensure everyone feels safe.
