Winnie Mayele, a beloved player from Macclesfield FC’s women’s team, has sadly passed away at just 19 after battling cancer. The news broke on December 21, and tributes have poured in highlighting her strength, talent, and positivity. Originally from Manchester, Winnie had previously overcome cancer and was preparing to start her studies at the University of Lancashire next year. Her former club, Droylsden Juniors, also paid their respects, remembering her as a joyful player who brought a smile to the game. Tragically, Winnie’s death comes shortly after the passing of another Macclesfield FC player, Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident the previous week. A fundraiser has been set up to support Winnie's family during this heartbreaking time. The football community is mourning the loss of two young talents within such a brief period, reflecting on their impact and the memories they leave behind.
