A new pub, 'The Station House', is set to open this Autumn in Cheadle Hulme, taking over the site of the old Platform 5 pub. Run by Almond Family Pubs and Joseph Holt, this spot promises a 1930s vibe with elegant decor, including brass and marble features, and plush leather booths. Thereâ€™ll be a spacious 100-seat outdoor terrace for those lovely sunny days, plus a traditional British roast on Sundays. Doug Almond expressed excitement about bringing quality food and drink to the area, noting their strong local ties. Richard Kershaw of Joseph Holt highlighted the collaboration between the two family-run businesses, marking a promising new chapter for the historic venue. This place is set to be a grand addition to the local scene!
