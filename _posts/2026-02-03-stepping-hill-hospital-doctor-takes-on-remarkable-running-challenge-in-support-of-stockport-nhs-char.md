Dr Nidhi Kakkar from Stepping Hill Hospital is on a monthly running mission to raise funds for Stockport NHS Charity. After kicking off the year with the Stockport Daffodil 10k, she’s gearing up for the Burj Khalifa Half Marathon this February. The money she raises will benefit local NHS services, including recently upgraded neo-natal rooms and a new therapy garden. Nidhi works as a resident medical fellow in geriatric medicine and has also turned her passion for art into fundraising, selling her pieces to support the charity. Having lost an impressive 71 kgs (11 stone) through running, she’s taken part in various marathons to fundraise. Stockport NHS Charity Manager, Kate Leadbeater, praised Nidhi's dedication, highlighting the positive impact her efforts have on patient care. If you fancy joining in or supporting Nidhi’s cause, don’t hesitate to check out her fundraiser!
