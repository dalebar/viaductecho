The 'One Stockport Construction Hub' has launched in Stockport, aimed at helping young people find careers in the construction industry. This hub serves as a central resource, offering apprenticeships, matchmaking for jobs and training, top-notch construction education, and support for sustainable technologies. Its mission is to connect residents with businesses and educational pathways, while also addressing skill shortages and promoting inclusion for underrepresented groups. Delivered by Stockport Council in partnership with Trafford College Group, the initiative aims to benefit the community amidst the town centre's regeneration. Council leaders highlight the hub as a significant milestone, providing a clear route into thousands of job opportunities while supporting those facing employment barriers. With a focus on building a bright, inclusive future for Stockport, this initiative promises to reshape how local contractors interact with talent and access educational resources.
