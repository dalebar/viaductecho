Andy Burnham introduced a sunny vision for Greater Manchester's railways, showcasing a yellow Bee Network train at Manchester Piccadilly. He emphasised a “new era” for passengers, with plans for eight commuter lines set to roll out starting December 2026. Initial services will connect Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge and Piccadilly to Glossop, expanding in 2027 and 2028 to include routes to the airport, Alderley Edge, Buxton, Rochdale, and more. By 2028, the aim is for a seamless transport system allowing passengers to use one card across buses, trams, and trains, similar to London.

Burnham is keen on having all local trains painted in the Bee Network's yellow livery to create clear identification for Greater Manchester services, despite potential conflicts with Great British Rail's branding. He acknowledged the need for collaboration among various transport organisations to make the scheme a success. Meanwhile, Northern will operate the main Bee Network services, with its managing director pledging to ensure accountability and commitment to improving connectivity in the area.
