Greater Manchester was blanketed in snow on the evening of January 8, thanks to Storm Goretti, which brought a yellow weather warning to the region. The Met Office issued a rare red alert for southern England, indicating severe weather with heavy snow, rain, and strong winds. Parts of Bury, east Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, and Tameside are under the yellow alert, lasting until midday the next day. The storm is predicted to unleash gusts of up to 100mph and potentially up to 30cm of snow in some areas, particularly in the Peak District. Residents shared photos showcasing the wintery scene across Greater Manchester as the storm continued to unfold.
