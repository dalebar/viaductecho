Greater Manchester's kicking off 2026 with icy weather, as temperatures remain below freezing this morning (January 2). A yellow weather warning for snow and ice is in place, making it tricky for drivers and pedestrians. While sunny spells are expected today, temperatures will only reach a maximum of 4C in areas like Manchester and Wigan, feeling much colder due to wind chill. Tonight will see temps drop to -4C in Oldham and -2C elsewhere, with 'feels like' temperatures hitting -7C in some spots. The Met Office warns of sleet and snow moving across the region, potentially bringing 1-5cm of snow in higher areas. Icy patches may develop quickly, so take care out there! This chilly weather is set to continue over the weekend, with similar lows expected.
