Andy Burnham's name is in the headlines as speculation about him challenging Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour Party leadership heats up. This follows Angela Rayner's resignation, which has cleared the way for Burnham, known as the "King of the North," to potentially step in. He recently discussed the Labour deputy leadership contest on BBC, showing support for candidates from his region. Plus, heâ€™s launched a new group called Mainstream, aiming to push forward radical policies and position himself for a leadership bid. A recent statement from the group challenged Starmer's direction, suggesting internal tensions. Polls indicate Burnham as a popular choice for leadership, viewing him favourably against Nigel Farage. To run, he'd need to become an MP again and resign as mayor, which hinges on finding a seat. The situation remains fluid with the Labour Party conference approaching, and while Burnham denies plans for a Westminster return, speculation persists.
