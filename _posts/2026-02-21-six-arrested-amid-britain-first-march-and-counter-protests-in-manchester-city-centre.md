Six people were arrested during a Britain First rally in Manchester City Centre, according to Greater Manchester Police. Supporters of the far-right group marched around Piccadilly, calling for 'remigration and mass deportations', starting their march around 1.20pm. In response, counter-demonstrations occurred, with groups such as Stand Up To Racism gathering in Piccadilly Gardens, where former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke. Police confirmed the arrests were for various offenses, including public order and assault on an emergency worker, amid a strong police presence aimed at managing safety. A 10-hour dispersal order gave officers enhanced powers to clear the area, and Assistant Chief Constable Rick Jackson highlighted that while facilitating peaceful protests was important, public safety remained the priority.
