In just 48 hours, nearly £40,000 has been raised for survivors of a tragic crash in Bolton that claimed four lives. The GoFundMe campaign was launched by friends to support four passengers in a taxi, including Tom and Georgina Daniels, who sustained severe injuries. They remain in hospital after the collision on January 11, which involved a taxi and a car driven at high speeds. The fundraiser aims to cover care expenses as insurance may not fully suffice. Georgina shared the harrowing experience, expressing disbelief at their survival and the long-lasting impacts of their injuries. The couple, married just seven months, faces an uncertain future and will need significant aftercare. The investigation continues into the crash, which also claimed the lives of three teenagers and the taxi driver. Despite the heartache, the community’s generosity shines through as they rally to support the recovering friends.
