Heineken, the brewing giant with a major site in Manchester, plans to cut 5,000 to 6,000 jobs over the next two years due to tough market conditions and a decline in beer demand. This represents about 7% of its global workforce. Although specific site impacts aren’t confirmed yet, brewery closures and consolidations are likely, alongside centralising operations. The company's total sales volumes dipped by 1.2% this year, with revenues down 4.7% to €34.3 billion (£29.8 billion). Operating profits also fell by 3.2% to €3.4 billion (£2.97 billion). Heineken reported a 3.4% drop in total drinks volumes in Europe, primarily affecting beer sales, though brands like Amstel and Murphy's stout saw some growth. Their UK operations, headquartered in Edinburgh, employ around 2,100 people, alongside 2,400 venues managed through their Star Pubs and Bars arm.
