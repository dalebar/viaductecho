A shop in Sale, Trafford, caught selling illegal cigarettes has been shut down, thanks to sniffer dog Dora. She discovered a hidden stash behind a light fitting at 7 Days Stop, leading to the seizure of over 1,200 cigarettes, hand-rolled tobacco, and vapes. Open packets were found under the counter, linked to selling to minors. Trafford Council has issued a three-month closure order, during which they plan to work with the store's owner on next steps. Interestingly, the new director has connections to another store in Hyde that had similar issues and was closed down after selling counterfeit products. Trafford Council emphasised that this illegal trade harms communities, supports crime, and undermines public health. They’re committed to cracking down on such activities, and Rose Thompson from Trafford Council stated they will take strong action against those violating regulations to protect local health and businesses.
