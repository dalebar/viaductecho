Gorton and Denton constituents are gearing up for a by-election on February 26 after MP Andrew Gwynne stepped down for health reasons. Gwynne has been a key figure in the area for 21 years, but his resignation follows a scandal and personal advice to take a break. The Labour Party has chosen local councillor Angeliki Stogia as their candidate, backed by prominent party members. Reform UK has brought in commentator and academic Matt Goodwin, framing the election as a referendum on Keir Starmer. The Liberal Democrats have nominated Jackie Pearcey, who's keen on fixing the NHS and tackling living costs, while the Green Party's Hannah Spencer aims to represent local interests and address economic issues. The Worker’s Party is still finalising their candidate. With a strong mix of local talent across parties, the by-election is definitely one to watch!
