Labour's chosen candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election is Angeliki Stogia, announced by Manchester MP Lucy Powell. This by-election, set for February 26, follows the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne for health reasons. Stogia, a Manchester city councillor since 2012, expressed her excitement about the campaign, emphasising her commitment to the local community and unity in Manchester. 

Other parties have also revealed their candidates. The Green Party's Hannah Spencer is a plumber and Trafford Council leader, while the Liberal Democrats have selected local campaigner Jackie Pearcey. Reform UK has chosen political commentator Matt Goodwin, who described the by-election as a referendum on Labour leader Keir Starmer. 

With a mix of local and national issues at play, the Gorton and Denton constituency is gearing up for a competitive race. Stogia's supporters are eager to rally behind her as she embarks on canvassing efforts. Overall, the vibe is one of enthusiasm and determination as the election approaches.
