Romiley, a charming village in Greater Manchester, is at odds over ongoing travel upgrades aimed at easing congestion. With lots of families and commuters, the area’s main roads get really busy, especially at rush hour. Stockport Council and Transport for Greater Manchester are investing £1.8m in improvements, including a new cycling track on Compstall Road and making Central Drive one-way. While these upgrades aim to create safer routes and reduce traffic, local residents and business owners have mixed feelings.

Jay Dunn, owner of The Crafty Vendor, fears the construction could hurt his bar’s outdoor seating and potentially cost him thousands in lost revenue. Similarly, Thomas Cooper from The Handyman feels blindsided by the short notice about the works, just as holiday shopping ramps up. Despite some complaints, others, like James Summercales, see temporary disruption as a positive way to encourage cycling and lessen traffic. The council assures that the works come after extensive consultation and are designed to enhance accessibility, promising to support businesses during this transition.
