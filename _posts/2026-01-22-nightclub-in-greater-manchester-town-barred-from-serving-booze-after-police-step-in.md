Decades Heaven and Hell nightclub in Stalybridge has lost its alcohol licence after the council stepped in following objections from Greater Manchester Police. Owner Ian Whittaker tried to appoint Natalie Robinson as the new designated premises supervisor (DPS), but her track record—particularly a violent assault involving staff at her other venue, Back to the 80s—raised concerns. Whittaker missed a crucial hearing on January 21, prompting the liquor licensing panel to proceed without him. Just before the meeting, Robinson withdrew her application to be DPS due to the police's objections. The panel heard about multiple violent incidents at Decades under her management during the festive season. With no alternative DPS presented, the panel turned down the application, meaning Decades can’t serve alcohol until a new manager is appointed.
