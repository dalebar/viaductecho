Sir Keir Starmer is facing backlash from Labour MPs and members after Andy Burnham was blocked from running in the Gorton and Denton by-election. The National Executive Committee (NEC) made this decision, led by Shabana Mahmood, aiming to avoid an unnecessary by-election for the Greater Manchester mayoralty. Burnham expressed his disappointment, suggesting he wasn't informed before the media, a claim Labour denies, insisting they tried to notify him promptly. Critics accuse Starmer and his team of factionally motivated interference, fearing a challenge from Burnham if he returns to Westminster. Some MPs, like Louise Haigh, urge the NEC to reconsider, warning that the party may suffer in the upcoming election. Meanwhile, others defended the NEC’s choice, believing it helps the party focus on winning rather than infighting. Burnham’s opportunity arose after Andrew Gwynne announced his resignation due to health issues. The situation reflects ongoing tensions within Labour as it navigates leadership dynamics and election preparations.
