Storm Benjamin has hit the UK, and while Greater Manchester has seen some dry spells, more rain is on the way. Although parts of Scotland might get snow over the weekend, Manchester is only expecting chilly conditions with typical Manchester rain returning by Sunday morning. Expect it to start drizzling around 8am and continue throughout the day. The good news is that tonight should remain dry and clear. The Met Office warns of a changeable week ahead with temps dipping to around 7°C and plenty of rain forecast from Monday to Wednesday. They also predict heavy downpours and strong winds might spread across the UK, especially in the west. So, keep your brolly handy – looks like autumn is sticking around!
