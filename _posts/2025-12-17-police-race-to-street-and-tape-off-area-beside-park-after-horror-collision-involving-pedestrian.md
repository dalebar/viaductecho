Emergency services were called to Stamford Street in Stalybridge, Tameside, on Tuesday (December 16) after a woman in her 60s was hit by a car. The area was cordoned off between Mellor Road and Astley Road, leading to traffic diversions and significant congestion, with some motorists describing the situation as 'chaos'. The woman was taken to hospital, but her condition hasn’t been confirmed yet. The driver stayed at the scene, and no arrests have been made. The road closure affected traffic for several hours as Greater Manchester Police and the North West Ambulance Service gathered details about the incident.
