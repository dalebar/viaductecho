A group of Manchester United players, including Senne Lammens, Ayden Heaven, Manuel Ugarte, and Tom Heaton, are backing a charity campaign led by Freddie Flintoff to raise £1.1 million for a new cinema in Manchester hospitals. The initiative, organised by Manchester Foundation Trust Charity, aims to create a fully accessible 50-seat MediCinema at the Oxford Road Campus, including Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary. So far, the appeal has raised over £250,000, with support from celebrities like Mason Mount and Wayne Rooney. The project promises to bring joy and therapeutic benefits to patients through films, with up to 260 screenings a year, including personalised viewings for sensitive cases. Local families are showin' their backing as well, like Hayley Evans, whose son Marley has faced serious health challenges. Hayley believes the cinema would offer vital moments of escape for kids in long-term care, allowing them some normality and joy. The initiative highlights a community coming together to support young patients in need.
