A yellow weather warning's been issued for much of the UK this weekend, with strong winds expected from 8pm on Sunday until 6pm Monday. The Met Office reckons this could disrupt travel across England and Wales, with delays likely for road, rail, air, and ferry services. Some coastal areas might face big waves and spray. While 'Storm Amy' has been named for the upcoming season, it hasn't been officially linked to this weekend's weather. The warning covers southern England, most of the North, and all of Wales. The Met Office advises keeping an eye on local forecasts and adjusting travel plans accordingly. Theyâ€™re monitoring a low-pressure system over the North Atlantic that's set to impact the UK, especially in the north, with heavy rain and strong winds anticipated. Keep yourself updated!
