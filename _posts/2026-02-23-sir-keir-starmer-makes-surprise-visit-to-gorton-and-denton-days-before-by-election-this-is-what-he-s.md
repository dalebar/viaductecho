Sir Keir Starmer made a surprise visit to Gorton and Denton, framing the by-election as a critical showdown between Labour and Reform. Speaking at Rushford Park football club, he emphasised that this election is about unity versus division and reflected on Labour's values of community cohesion. Starmer stressed the importance of Labour's candidate, Angeliki Stogia, highlighting her commitment to public service amid concerns that Labour is trailing behind both Reform and the Green Party in polling. He blamed the Conservatives for years of neglect and austerity in the area and pointed to Labour's plans to improve local lives. Starmer also took aim at the Green Party's drug policy, suggesting that voting for them could inadvertently help Reform gain ground. He warned that a vote for the Greens could mean a loss for Labour, drawing parallels to previous close results. Overall, the message was about protecting community values and delivering for local constituents.
