Mark Roberts, the leader of Stockport Council, has expressed concerns about a proposed new town with up to 20,000 homes near Adlington, Cheshire, right by Stockport's border. He worries this development could significantly strain local roads and public services, as the government hasn't engaged with residents' concerns. The Lib Dem council chief accused the government of prioritising development over local needs, advocating for a brownfield-first approach to housing. While Stockport aims to build 8,000 new homes in the town centre and 25,000 overall by 2042, residents are protesting the Adlington plans. The government has defended its housing strategy, claiming it will not harm the environment and aims to help families achieve homeownership. Roberts urges the government to listen more to local communities rather than imposing developments.
