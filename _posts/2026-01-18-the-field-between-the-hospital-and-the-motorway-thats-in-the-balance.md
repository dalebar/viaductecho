Plans to build 250 homes on green land near Royal Bolton Hospital have sparked backlash from local residents. Developer Anwyl argues the new estate will provide high-quality homes for locals, but many are concerned about losing green space and traffic congestion, especially on Plodder Lane, which is already struggling. Longtime residents like Alan Sampson, 74, worry about wildlife loss and the impact of increased cars on an already busy area. Others, like Mohammed Akram, fear flooding issues and potential restrictions on hospital expansion due to the development. Coun Sue Haworth points out residents feel blindsided by the plans and want their voices heard, highlighting that while some support more housing, traffic impact reports are unimpressive. Anwyl insists there's significant demand for affordable housing in Bolton, noting many people are on waiting lists, and claims their development will include measures to support local wildlife and manage flood risk. The consultation on the plans runs until January 26.
