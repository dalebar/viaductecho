Salford Red Devils, a club with a rich 152-year history, has sadly gone into liquidation, racking up debts of around £4 million. Despite some recent successes, financial struggles have plagued them since moving from their beloved Willows ground to a new site at Barton-upon-Irwell. The club's reliance on grants and loans from Salford City Council has intensified scrutiny, with allegations of poor management decisions leading to significant tensions within the council. Attendance has never matched that of rival towns, and inconsistent finances deterred star players. A new ownership consortium in February 2025 appeared promising, but issues like unpaid wages quickly emerged, fuelling frustrations and protests from supporters. The club expressed deep sadness at its condition but remained grateful to the loyal fanbase. The RFL has now terminated the club’s membership following the liquidation ruling. Despite the heartache, supporters, like the 1873 group, are determined that the spirit of the club will endure, calling for a new entity to assume operations and revive Salford Rugby League on the local scene.
