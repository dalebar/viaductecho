Manchester Cathedral is gearing up for a £600,000 restoration of its bells, which have been ringing for a century. The Julia Rousing Trust has stepped up as the leading donor, contributing half of the funds needed. In a nod to the city’s rich music scene, the cathedral is inviting locals to compose a new chime for the renovated bell tower through a competition. Canon Precentor Dr Ian Jorysz mentioned that the existing wooden frame is worn out, and they plan to add three more bells to improve sound quality and versatility. The competition’s deadline is set for the 31st January 2026. The bells have a long history, with the current set recast in 1925, and the cathedral itself dates back to 1421. They’re looking to raise the remaining funds through public donations, as they don’t get government support. Dean Rogers Govinder emphasised the significance of the project, aiming to celebrate the bells’ rich heritage and ensure they resonate for future generations during festive times and beyond.
