Mad Friday's vibe in Manchester varies in 2025, depending on where you are and who you ask. In Piccadilly Gardens, the Christmas market feels lacklustre, with staff at bars like Off-Piste noting it's the quietest they've seen, attributing it to fewer tourists and tightening finances after a tough year. In contrast, the Millstone pub is buzzing with karaoke and festive cheer, attracting a mix of ages but with a slightly older crowd. Younger revelers like Grace believe Mad Friday is still alive, while others like Mia find it costly. The overall sentiment suggests Mad Friday persists in pockets, particularly among the older crowd, while the new generation is more low-key, having adapted to a post-COVID work culture and spending habits. The scene reflects a blend of nostalgia and changing social norms, showing that while Mad Friday might be quieter, it's not completely fading away.
