Two men were arrested in Oldham after police raided homes on Vicarage Street and Chapel Road following a shooting on School House Road. The shooting happened on Sunday, February 15, and involved a gunman firing at a property, leaving multiple bullet holes but no injuries. The arrests, made early on February 17, are part of an ongoing investigation into what police believe was a targeted attack. Officers are seeking witnesses or anyone with CCTV or dash cam footage from the area. Detective Inspector Rachel Smith emphasised the need for community support and reassured locals with extra patrols in place for safety. Anyone with information can contact Greater Manchester Police or report anonymously to Crimestoppers.
