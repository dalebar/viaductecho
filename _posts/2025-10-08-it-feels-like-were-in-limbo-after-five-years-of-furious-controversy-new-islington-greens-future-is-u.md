Five years ago, New Islington residents rallied against a developer's plan to build office blocks on New Islington Green, a beloved local green space. With over 5,000 signatures on a petition, community opposition was strong, but the Manchester council approved the plans in December 2020. The project was set to replace the four acres of green with five office blocks and promise two-and-a-half acres of new green space. However, after delays and a redesign in late 2023, which aims to blend the new buildings with the areaâ€™s Victorian charm, construction has yet to start. Planning permission has been pending for over 18 months, leaving residents like Nikki Christie and Adam Clark apprehensive about losing their green space amidst ongoing construction in the area. Many locals, feeling a sense of confusion and uncertainty, are hoping for less development and more clarity about the future of their park. General Projects has not commented on the situation.
