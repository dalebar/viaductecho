The McDonald’s in Pilsworth, Bury, has reopened after a makeover aimed at enhancing customer service. The branch now features a fresh layout and the 'Ready on Arrival' service for quicker pick-ups. This revamp is part of McDonald's 'Convenience of the Future' initiative, bringing modern upgrades across the UK, including three ultra-rapid EV chargers for electric vehicle users. The seating areas have also been redesigned with extra charging points and electric shades for the patio. Local franchisee Simon Toft expressed his excitement about the investment and improvement. Meanwhile, another McDonald's in Bury town centre is undergoing renovations and is due to reopen on February 4. These changes coincide with the council's upcoming survey on takeaway restaurants, aiming to address concerns over rising child obesity levels in the area.
