Passengers in Greater Manchester are being warned to expect travel disruptions due to snow and ice. A Met Office warning is in place until Monday afternoon, advising caution as conditions could hinder travel. Train services, particularly in Crewe and across Scotland, are experiencing delays and cancellations. Bury Council has deployed gritters to maintain road safety. 

The Met Office suggests preparing for potential power cuts caused by the weather, recommending items like candles, torches, power packs, blankets, and warm clothes. If you're stuck indoors, stay warm and safe, and check on neighbours. For those who need to drive, it’s best to avoid heavy snow, but if you must, drive with care—use low gears, maintain distance, and plan your route ahead of time. Also, ensure your vehicle is equipped with essentials for the journey. Stay warm out there and take care!
