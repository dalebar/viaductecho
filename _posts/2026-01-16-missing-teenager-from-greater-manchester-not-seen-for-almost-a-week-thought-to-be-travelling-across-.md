A 16-year-old boy named Eisa from Bolton has been missing for almost a week, last seen on January 9 at 6.30pm on Prince Street. He’s believed to have travelled down to Gatwick and then possibly to Brighton. Eisa is a black male, 6ft 2ins tall, slim build, with medium-length braids and a middle parting. He was last spotted wearing a black and blue tracksuit and black trainers. Greater Manchester Police are increasingly worried for his safety and have shared his photo in a public appeal. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is encouraged to get in touch with the police at 0161 856 5511, quoting log number 53 of 10.01.2026.
