The Government is planning to build a new railway line between Birmingham and Manchester, following the scrapping of HS2 plans due to costs. This new line won't be HS2 but aims to relieve pressure on the West Coast Main Line. There's no timeline for its construction, as it will open only after the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project is completed. NPR aims to improve rail connections across Northern England, starting with upgrades between Sheffield, Leeds, York, and Bradford, among others. There are also plans to reopen the Leamside Line and create new routes connecting Liverpool and Manchester via the airport. The Treasury has set a £45 billion funding cap for NPR, with £1.1 billion dedicated to initial development and planning. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the importance of this project for northern communities, promising real change and investment, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasised the need for renewal and job creation in the region.
