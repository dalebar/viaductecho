Demonstrations in Manchester supporting Palestine are set to proceed this weekend, despite a recent tragic terror attack outside a synagogue. Organisers, Greater Manchester Friends of Palestine, confirmed the pro-Palestine march will take place in the city centre at noon. This news comes after the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, condemned those who protested shortly after the attack, labelling it "un-British." The attack resulted in the deaths of two local residents during Yom Kippur celebrations. The protests aim to highlight what organisers describe as genocide in Gaza and commemorate over 20,000 Palestinian children killed in the conflict. Critics, including MP Graham Stringer, argue the protests should be called off out of respect for the Jewish community's mourning. A counter-march, "Manchester stands with Israel," is also planned for Sunday, amidst warnings of severe weather. Amid ongoing protests and police arrests across the UK, Mahmood expressed disappointment at the continuation of marches during a time of communal grief.
