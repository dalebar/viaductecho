A bloke from Oldham, Shakil Uddin, has been found guilty of attempted murder after he and others petrol-bombed a house in Stoke-on-Trent, forcing a mum and her 13-year-old daughter to jump from a window to escape. The attack, which left the woman with 65% burns and requiring two months in a coma, followed a street brawl involving several men. They smashed windows, poured petrol, and set fire to the home. Uddin, 23, was among ten men convicted of various offences, including grievous bodily harm and arson. The mum and daughter endured horrific injuries, with the woman needing to relearn how to walk. After a detailed 11-week trial, detectives praised the thorough investigation that brought these attackers to justice. Sentencing for the convicted men is yet to be scheduled.
