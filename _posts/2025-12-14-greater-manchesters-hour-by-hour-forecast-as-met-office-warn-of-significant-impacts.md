Greater Manchester is in for a soaking tomorrow with heavy rain expected all day under a yellow weather warning. Every borough will be affected, bringing a potential 40-60mm of rain, and up to 100mm in higher areas. This wet spell follows today's rain and is likely to persist through the week. The Met Office has warned of significant surface water flooding, particularly over the weekend, and the Environment Agency is actively working to mitigate impacts. They're advising folks to avoid driving through flood water, as it can be deceptively deep. Alongside the yellow warning, there's also an amber rain warning in Cumbria. Keep an eye on updates and check your flood risk!
