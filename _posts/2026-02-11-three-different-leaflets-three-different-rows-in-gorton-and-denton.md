As the Gorton and Denton by-election approaches on February 26, tensions are rising among the parties. Reform UK and the Green Party are seen as the main contenders against Labour, with claims of a 'two-horse race' emerging from these challenger parties. Labour, however, is disputing these claims, asserting its strength despite internal criticism. Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader, warns that the Greens risk being manipulated by Reform, while other Labour members accuse the Green Party of misleading campaigning.

Prominent Manchester academic Robert Ford has raised concerns over the electoral projections, suggesting that consolidating the left vote could be key, and contending that parties should focus on their policies rather than their standings. Meanwhile, the Green Party has faced backlash after using Ford's quotes in campaign material without his consent. Although they recalled the controversial leaflets, the incident has sparked an open complaint from Ford about trust issues in politics. Reform UK is also facing scrutiny for a potential electoral law breach related to their campaigning materials.
