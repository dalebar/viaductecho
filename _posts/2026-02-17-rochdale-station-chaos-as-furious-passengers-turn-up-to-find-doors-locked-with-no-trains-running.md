Commuters at Rochdale train station faced a frustrating morning as it remained shut due to staff shortages, leaving no trains running to or from the station. National Rail confirmed the situation, advising delays of up to 15 minutes on affected routes, which include services to Manchester, Blackburn, and Leeds. Disruption is expected until at least 8am. People waiting for trains speculated whether there was a strike as they posted photos of the closed gates. As a workaround, commuters are encouraged to use Metrolink or various bus services to bridge the gap between Manchester and Rochdale. The situation has drawn attention, but the Manchester Evening News is also keeping folks updated with the latest stories and features.
