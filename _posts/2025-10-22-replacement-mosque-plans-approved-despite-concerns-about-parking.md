Plans to rebuild the mosque in Prestwich have been given the green light, despite a petition with 1,630 signatures against it. The Prestwich Muslim Welfare Trust aims to replace their old one-storey building on Bury Old Road with a new facility offering worship, education, and community services. Concerns were raised during the council meeting, particularly about parking issues during Friday prayers, as nearby residents reported blocked driveways and traffic chaos. The mosque plans to increase parking on-site from 17 to 20 spaces and will contribute £6,000 annually for traffic enforcement. They’re also coordinating with the Maccabi centre for extra parking and are proposing a park-and-ride scheme from Heaton Park. Supporters argue that the mosque is vital, having served the community since 1999, and stress that improvements are being made to address traffic issues. The council committee approved the plans, with a strong majority of local feedback in support despite the petition. The new building will feature various community facilities, aiming to cater to the growing demand from the local Muslim community.
