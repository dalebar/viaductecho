The United Café bar and off licence near Old Trafford has been hit with a £10,000 fine after inspectors discovered serious food hygiene violations, including signs of a rat infestation. During an investigation by Trafford Council, they found gnawed potatoes and droppings in food areas, as well as an incident where an undercover officer was served a burger containing gluten despite declaring an allergy. The café, operated by Café United Ltd, failed to conduct proper daily pest checks and falsely reported being pest-free. After voluntarily closing for eight days to address these issues, they were inspected again in November and repeated the allergen mistake. The café and its director, Sean Stokes, pleaded guilty to the offences and were fined, with Councillor Rose Thompson emphasising the council's commitment to food safety standards in the community.
