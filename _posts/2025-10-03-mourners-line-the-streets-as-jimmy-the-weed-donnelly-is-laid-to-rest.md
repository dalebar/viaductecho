Mourners gathered in Manchester today to pay their respects to Jimmy 'The Weed' Donnelley, a key figure in the Quality Street Gang, who passed away at 84 after battling cancer. His funeral procession featured a horse-drawn carriage adorned with an Irish tri-colour and a pipe band, starting from his home in Ancoats and ending at St Joseph's cemetery following a mass at St Patrick's Church. The service reportedly included a reading by TV star Max Beesley. Jimmy, a proud Wythenshawe native, was known for his criminal exploits in the 60s, 70s, and 80s and even authored an autobiography in 2011, candidly reflecting on his life as a villain. He spoke of handling stolen goods and surviving life-threatening situations, while also managing various pubs, clubs, and car dealerships. His brother, Arthur Donnelly, passed away just weeks before him, adding to the familyâ€™s sorrow. The family expressed immense pride in Jimmy's legacy, particularly highlighting the Thin Lizzy song inspired by him.
