On Yom Kippur, a tragic incident unfolded outside Heaton Park synagogue when a driver ploughed into a crowd and began stabbing people. Witnesses described chaos as Rabbi Daniel Walker blocked the doors to protect those inside. Within minutes, armed police arrived, and the suspect was shot dead shortly after the attack began. Unfortunately, two bystanders lost their lives, and four others were seriously injured. In the aftermath, the Jewish community expressed their deep concerns about rising antisemitism, linking the attack to escalating tensions linked to geopolitical conflicts. Police confirmed the event as a terrorist incident, and clarifications were made regarding the suspect's vest, which initially looked explosive but was found non-viable. Local residents and officials expressed solidarity with the victims, while Greater Manchester leaders vowed to unite against hate and division in the community.
