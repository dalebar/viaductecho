Two homeless men were turned away from a Holiday Inn in Manchester during freezing temperatures, despite having a pre-paid booking from donations. The receptionist cited company policy against accommodating "people from the streets", leaving one man, Callum Donaghey, devastated. Local charity and MPs condemned the decision as inhumane. Following a report by the Manchester Evening News, the hotel group IHG stepped in, funding warm accommodation for Callum and facilitating his entry into rehab. They expressed regret over the incident, claiming no such policy existed, and promised to enhance staff training on accommodation for vulnerable individuals. Callum expressed gratitude for the support he received but felt the incident shouldn’t have happened at all. He highlighted the discrimination faced by homeless people, urging for clear policies in big companies to prevent future occurrences. Amanda Thompson from the outreach group Two Brews echoed this sentiment, stating that no one should be judged based on their circumstances. The incident sparked a wider conversation about the treatment of homeless individuals and the need for more compassionate policies.
