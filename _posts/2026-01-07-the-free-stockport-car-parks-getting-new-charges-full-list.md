From January 8, Stockport will introduce charges at 18 previously free car parks, with another six set to follow on February 10. Prices start at 50p for an hour and go up to £2.40 for ten hours. The move aims to help balance the council’s budget, which primarily funds services for vulnerable adults and children. Councillor Grace Baynham emphasised the need to maintain and invest in the transportation network. While some councillors worry that the charges may deter shoppers and impact local businesses, Baynham ruled out a proposed grace period for parking, stating it would lead to increased costs and make the scheme unviable. A limited number of resident permits will be available for those nearby at a cost of £47.50 annually, or £23.75 for Leisure Key holders. The affected car parks include several locations in Marple, Bramhall, Heaton Moor, and more.
