Exciting plans for the Church Wharf site in Bolton are on the brink of approval, with a £150m development featuring 418 new homes, a six-storey, 130-bedroom hotel, and spaces for bars, restaurants, and shops. Led by Manchester-based developer Watson, the project spans 3.2 hectares of former car parks, promising a mix of one, two, and three-bedroom residences, including some affordable options. While only 88 off-road parking spaces are planned, accessibility to transport justifies this shortfall. A public plaza, Churchbank Square, will be a central feature for residents and visitors alike. Bolton Council's provisional sale of the land for just £4 supports the initiative, alongside £5m from the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to regenerate the area. Following a previous unsuccessful partnership, this transformative project aims to revitalize Bolton's town centre and could see completion by 2029. Planners have recommended approval ahead of the committee's decision on October 1.
