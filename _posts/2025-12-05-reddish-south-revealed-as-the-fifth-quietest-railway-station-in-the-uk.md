Reddish South railway station has been named one of the quietest in the UK, with just 102 entries and exits from April 2024 to March 2025. Only Denton, Ince & Elton, Shippea Hill, and Elton & Orston had fewer passengers. In stark contrast, Stockport station saw around 4.3 million entries and exits in the same period. Opened in 1849, Reddish South used to be bustling with two island platforms, but traffic dwindled significantly after services shifted to Manchester Piccadilly. Despite only averaging two passengers a week, the line remains busy with freight trains. In Stockport, Cheadle Hulme and Heaton Chapel follow Stockport station in usage, showcasing a range of passenger numbers across the area.
