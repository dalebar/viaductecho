Plans are in the works for an Aldi store at the former Abbey Lakes Hall in Orrell, which could create 50 new jobs. The proposal includes demolishing existing buildings, constructing a single-storey, 17,500 sq ft store with access roads and 107 parking spaces (including accessible and parent/child spaces). There’ll also be electric vehicle charging points, motorcycle spaces, bike stands, and internal storage for employees. The planning committee will review the application on October 28, with 44 responses received—13 against and 30 in favour. While the site is within the Green Belt, it's previously developed, and council officers have recommended approval. If passed, this could mark a significant update for the area!
