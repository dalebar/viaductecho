Leaders and campaigners have expressed disappointment after a meeting with the Prime Minister led to no agreement on the Hillsborough Law. They’ve accused Sir Keir Starmer of lacking the courage to challenge the security services. Some Labour MPs, including Hillsborough survivors, are contemplating voting against the government over what they see as a diluted version of the law they’ve long fought for. The proposed Hillsborough Law aims to enforce accountability among public officials, but recent amendments could exempt intelligence services like MI5 from this duty, causing uproar. Elkan Abrahamson, a lawyer for the campaign, argues this could allow security heads to ignore accountability. Liverpool MP Ian Byrne is particularly frustrated, saying the government has broken its promise for a comprehensive law, risking justice for families affected by past tragedies. Campaigners insist that any legal framework must ensure accountability for all, including the security sectors. A government spokesperson maintains their commitment to creating strong legislation while balancing national security needs, but many feel the current amendments don’t meet that standard.
