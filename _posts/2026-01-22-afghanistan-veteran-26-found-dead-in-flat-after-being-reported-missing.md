Lewis Feeley, a 26-year-old from Bury, was found dead in his flat on April 28, 2025. He had struggled with mental health issues after serving in Afghanistan and had been reported missing by his father, Andrew Feeley, weeks prior. Unfortunately, police did not act on the missing person report due to insufficient information. Described as intelligent and sociable, Lewis had been a popular figure back home, but his mental health deteriorated. His mother, Michelle Hardman, shared that he experienced paranoia and behaved erratically. Despite encouragement to seek help, he distanced himself from loved ones and the NHS mental health services. There were troubling signs, including rent arrears and a potential drug debt. After his family contacted the police again, Lewis was found unresponsive in his flat. The inquest revealed he took his own life, with a toxicology report showing traces of alcohol, cocaine, and codeine. The coroner, Catherine McKenna, expressed condolences, affirming Lewis was a remarkable young man. Support is available through Samaritans, who provide 24/7 assistance.
