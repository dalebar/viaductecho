Police are investigating a shocking incident in Salford, where gunshots were fired at a block of flats on Lissadel Street on the night of October 6. At least seven bullet holes were found in the windows and front door after multiple loud bangs were heard, initially thought to be fireworks. Five men, aged between 20 and 39, have been arrested on suspicion of firearm possession and remain in custody. Local resident Brian Cooper, whose flat was hit, expressed his shock, stating he didn't expect bullets and described feeling shaken up. Thankfully, no one was injured, but police believe it was a targeted attack. Detective Chief Inspector Martyn Johnson acknowledged community concerns and encouraged anyone with information or footage to come forward, emphasising that the use of firearms is unacceptable. Residents are urged to report any information via police channels or anonymously through Crimestoppers.
