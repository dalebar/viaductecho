People in Manchester are feeling uneasy about strangers recording them using Meta glasses, which discreetly capture photos and videos. These glasses, created by Meta (the company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), look like regular eyewear but have an in-built camera. Incidents have emerged, like one involving a shop worker, Josh, who was filmed without consent while he was working. The video, shared online as part of a TikTok project, sparked outrage and raised concerns about privacy and consent. Other individuals have also reported uncomfortable encounters with men wearing these glasses, leading many to feel violated. Despite Meta’s claim that their glasses indicate when recording is happening, users often ignore this. The discussion around this issue is ongoing, with calls for clearer regulations around filming in public spaces. Josh, who reported the incident, highlighted the need for awareness about how these devices can be misused, particularly in settings like shops and public transport. TikTok has since banned the account responsible for posting the inappropriate content. The situation stresses the importance of respecting privacy and consent.
