A former sickly puppy, Perla, who was abandoned with severe skin issues near the Rochdale Canal, has made a remarkable recovery and found her forever home with Sandra in Warrington. Rescuers discovered the young Cane Corso last January, suffering from a bad case of Demodex mange, and she was cared for at the RSPCA’s Greater Manchester Animal Hospital. After months of treatment, Sandra shared how well Perla has settled in, even with some scarring still visible. 

Another rescue, Lola, a Japanese Akita found in dire conditions in Durham earlier this year, has also flourished after intensive care and has been rehomed. Her new owner, Alison, felt an instant connection with her. Other heartwarming stories include Merry, a Staffordshire bull terrier cross rescued from rubbish in Birmingham, and Boris, a tabby cat recovering from injuries who found a loving couple to adopt him. It’s heartening to see these animals transform and find their forever homes!
