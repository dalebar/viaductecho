Drivers are facing delays on the M66 near Bury due to a police-led incident that has closed the southbound carriageway between Ramsbottom and Edenfield. Greater Manchester Police are on the scene, with reports suggesting a person may have fallen from a bridge. National Highways North West confirmed the traffic stoppage on social media, and although vehicles have finally begun to move again, congestion is still building up. 

The latest from traffic monitoring indicates queues from Ramsbottom Junction to Edenfield, with delays of around 30 minutes reported. Traffic is also slow on nearby roads, including Bolton Road North and Whalley Road, causing further disruption. Updates are available in the live blog, and the situation is still ongoing.
