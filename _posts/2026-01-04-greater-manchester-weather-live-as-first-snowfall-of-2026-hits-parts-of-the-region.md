Snow is finally falling on Greater Manchester today, January 4, 2026, marking the first snowfall of the year. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice, effective from 3pm today until midday tomorrow. This warning covers much of north west and south west England, as well as most of Wales.

Expect a sunny start to the day, but clouds will roll in later on, with the chance of snow flurries rising to 40% by 6pm. It’ll feel even colder due to wind gusts, reaching a 'feels like' temperature of -1°C. Keep an eye on local updates for the latest on this chilly weather!
