A Cadbury selection box is a festive treat that remains a favourite, especially with its blend of goodies like Giant Buttons, Dairy Milk, Fingers, and Twirl. This year, Sainsbury's and Tesco are pricing it at £7.50, while B&M has a fab deal at £5, making it a third cheaper than Morrisons. Asda's close behind with a price of £5.24. There’s also an exclusive Cadbury hamper at B&M for £10, featuring new treats like the Dairy Milk Biscoff Bar alongside classic favourites. Besides that, there are other sweet options available, such as the McVitie's Jaffa Christmas Tree and various Swizzels products. For those curious about what’s inside popular chocolate tubs like Quality Street and Celebrations, there’s a full breakdown online. Perfect for getting into that Christmas spirit!
