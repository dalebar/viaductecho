Sir Keir Starmer has explained the decision to prevent Andy Burnham from running in the Gorton and Denton by-election, saying it would take resources away from vital upcoming Labour campaigns in local elections across England, Wales, and Scotland. He praised Burnham for his work as Greater Manchester Mayor but stressed that focusing on necessary elections is essential.
