Traffic on the M6 motorway in Greater Manchester was completely halted following a crash involving an overturned car between Junction 24 and Junction 25 near Wigan. The incident was reported around 8.30pm, leading to long queues forming in the area. Emergency services promptly attended the scene.

National Highways confirmed that traffic remained stopped until recovery operations were underway. After some time, two lanes reopened, allowing cars to start moving again, although two lanes remained closed pending the recovery of the vehicle. As of the latest updates, there were still queues, with about two-and-a-half miles of congestion reported. 

Motorway cameras showed that traffic was beginning to flow after the initial blockage, and National Highways thanked drivers for their patience during this disruption. Further updates will be provided as the situation develops. Safe travels if you're heading out!
