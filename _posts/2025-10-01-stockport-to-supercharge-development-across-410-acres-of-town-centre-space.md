Exciting times ahead for Stockport! The Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) is gearing up to expand its reach, now set to cover the entire town centre, not just the previous 130 acres. This means big plans for 8,000 new homes over the next 15 years, starting with 1,200 around King Street West in the Stockport 8 development. Cllr Mark Roberts emphasised the transformative vision for the area, turning derelict sites into vibrant communities complete with schools, health hubs, and green spaces. Mayor Andy Burnham hailed Stockport as a model for urban regeneration, pointing out the impressive progress made. All thatâ€™s left is to get the boundary change legally sorted in Parliament, and then it's full steam ahead for a revitalised, people-friendly town centre!
