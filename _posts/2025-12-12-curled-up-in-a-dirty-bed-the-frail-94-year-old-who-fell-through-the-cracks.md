Lillian Walsh, a frail 94-year-old pensioner, was found in a dire state at home, prompting alarm from paramedics. Weighing under six stone and suffering from various severe health issues, she was rushed to hospital but sadly passed away two days later. The inquest revealed shocking neglect not only from her son, Graham Walsh, who was convicted of ill-treating her, but also from Bury council’s adult social care department. Despite being arranged a high-level care package when she left a short-stay care home, no oversight ensued after a single uncorroborated call led to her case closure. The coroner highlighted systemic failures in care, questioning how Lillian could "disappear off the face of Bury council's earth." Graham, who initially claimed to care for her well but later admitted he should have sought help sooner, received a community order sentence for his neglect. Following the inquest, Bury council expressed deep regret, promising significant changes to prevent such tragedies in the future.
