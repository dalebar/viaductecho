An inquest has revealed the tragic killing of 51-year-old Michelle Hodgkinson in Droylsden on June 2, 2023, by Paul Hughes, a total stranger. Hughes inflicted 50 stab wounds on her in broad daylight, allegedly driven by paranoid psychosis linked to his diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia. He was found mentally unfit to stand trial and was given an indefinite hospital order after a jury ruled he unlawfully killed Hodgkinson. The inquest detailed how at 10:45 AM, Hughes bought kitchen knives from Asda before attacking Hodgkinson as she walked over the Ashton Canal bridge, en route to meet her mum for coffee. Witnesses reported seeing her trying to defend herself. Despite emergency services being called, she sadly died at the scene. Hughes was arrested soon after, but remained unresponsive and could not be questioned further. DNA linked him to the scene of the crime. The investigation continues.
