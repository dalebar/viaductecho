Last year's New Year’s Message highlighted tough times with financial struggles and homelessness, and unfortunately, 2025 isn't much better, grappling with floods, a stagnant economy, and migration challenges. While solutions may be elusive, Mustard Tree is committed to helping everyone who walks through its doors. They've shared inspiring stories of individuals like Queen, who overcame eviction to pursue a nursing career; Tom, who found purpose through volunteering; Badar, who moved from homelessness to attending college; and Terry, who received crucial support after losing his wife. This year, Mustard Tree launched the ‘Show Me Hope’ campaign, echoing JFK's call for civic engagement and optimism. Manchester is on the rise, recently named the second-best city in the UK, and with £1B investment announced, there's hope for more affordable housing. Support from the community is vital, whether it’s stocking food clubs or assisting with rent deposits. Here's to a bright, prosperous 2026 for all in Manchester!
