Manchester is gearing up for a fantastic free extravaganza – the Super Duper Family Festival – running from February 18 to 21. This city-wide event promises an array of activities for families, including crafting, gaming, dancing, sports, and storytelling across iconic venues like Aviva Studios, Manchester Arndale, and the Science and Industry Museum. With a rich lineup of partners like BBC’s CBeebies and Super League Basketball, there's something for everyone.

New attractions for 2026 include the Story Den at Central Library, offering daily Lego workshops and interactive storytelling, and creative workshops at People’s History Museum focused on activism. Families can dive into fun at The Studios for hands-on film and tech experiences, or enjoy the retro gaming zone at Printworks. 

Returning favourites include carnival games in St Ann’s Square and exciting activities inspired by BBC's Waterloo Road at Exchange Square. Plus, Manchester’s hotels and eateries are offering discounts to make the adventure even sweeter. With free entry and family-friendly transport options, it’s set to be a memorable half-term break in the city!
