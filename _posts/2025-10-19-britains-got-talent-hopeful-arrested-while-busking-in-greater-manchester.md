In a surprising turn of events, 17-year-old Charlie Wilson was arrested while busking in Bury town centre on August 24. The aspiring singer, known for his recent audition for Britain's Got Talent, was using an amplified speaker when a police officer informed him he was breaching a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) enforced by Bury Council. The officer threatened to arrest him if he didnâ€™t stop performing, leading to a tense exchange where Charlie was eventually handcuffed after refusing to give his name. Witnesses were shocked by the police's heavy-handed approach, especially as Charlie was simply entertaining passers-by. Post-incident, a superintendent expressed that the officer could have exercised more discretion. Although Charlie got released after providing his details, he received a notification about refraining from anti-social behaviour. Despite the ordeal, he remains hopeful and recently auditioned for Britain's Got Talent in London. The incident raises questions about the balance between law enforcement and community engagement, as the PSPO is set for a review in 2026.
