In January, Greater Manchester's A&E saw nearly 4,400 patients waiting over 12 hours for admission, a steep rise from previous months and the second highest on record. This surge reflects ongoing pressures on the NHS since the pandemic, with January traditionally being a tough month due to high demand and winter illnesses. Meanwhile, across England, over 71,500 patients faced similar waits, marking a significant increase from previous months. 

Although emergency care is stretched, there have been some improvements in specific areas, like four-hour waiting times. The NHS is focusing on increasing capacity and improving patient flow, while also urging the public to consider alternative services for urgent care. 

On a brighter note, waiting lists for non-urgent care are decreasing, with the number of patients waiting over a year down significantly from previous years. Staff are working overtime under challenging conditions, and their efforts are appreciated as the system continues to cope with winter pressures.
