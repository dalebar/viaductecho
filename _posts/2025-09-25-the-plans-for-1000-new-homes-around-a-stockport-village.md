Developers are eyeing up Woodford, near Stockport, for over 1,000 new homes amidst plans for significant growth in the area. Recent applications include one for 554 homes by Russell LDP, featuring affordable housing and amenities like a medical centre and nature park. Meanwhile, David Wilson Homes is consulting on plans for another 450 homes, also with a portion designated as affordable. Local councillor Peter Crossen has expressed residents' frustrations, noting concerns over the erosion of green spaces and inadequate infrastructure to support these developments. He criticises the council, saying the lack of a local plan means theyâ€™re losing control over the situation. Stockport council recently received a nudge from the government to speed up the local plan, which has seen delays due to increased housing targets. Council leader Mark Roberts countered Crossen's criticisms, defending their housing strategy and blaming government changes for planning challenges. The debate highlights tensions around housing development and green belt preservation in Stockport.
