A man suspected of immigration offences was arrested outside Co-op Live in east Manchester during a RAYE concert. Police, patrolling the area, noticed him and utilised advanced CCTV and their specialist training to monitor the situation. A stop-and-search revealed he was wanted, leading to his arrest for questioning. This action was part of GMP's Project Servator, which focuses on disrupting criminal activity while reassuring the public. GMP reassured concert-goers that such operations are standard and urged anyone who notices anything unusual to report it. Officers will also be present at the arena during the upcoming 2026 BRIT Awards, which is expected to attract a large crowd.
