A new Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing Centre (SMMC) is set to open in Rochdale at Kingsway Business Park, bringing thousands of potential jobs to the area. This centre will support advanced manufacturing and scientific research, contributing to Atom Valley’s development as a top-notch hub for these sectors. Spanning 2,724 sq m, the facility will feature laboratories, workshops, metrology space, design studios, a lecture theatre, and office spaces, all aimed at fostering innovation and start-ups. Expected to be completed by summer 2026, construction is being led by Wilson Bowden Developments Limited, with legal support from DWF. Local council members express excitement about how the SMMC will enhance Greater Manchester's industrial offerings and generate highly skilled jobs. Overall, it's seen as a major boost for the borough’s economy.
