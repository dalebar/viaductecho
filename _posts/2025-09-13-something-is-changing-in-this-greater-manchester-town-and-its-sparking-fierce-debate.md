The proposed transfer of Farnworth library to a new development at Farnworth Green has ignited a lively debate among locals. Bolton Council is encouraging residents to weigh in on this move from the current grade II listed Carnegie building on Market Street, which many cherish but is in need of significant repairs. The planned new library would be larger and more strategically located in the town centre, aiming to transform the space into a vibrant community hub. Some residents like Ann Melmoth see the opportunity for a modern library that better serves community needs, while others, like Jim Elton, worry about losing the historic building's charm. Bucks like Shirley Pope concern that the current library may fall into disrepair, regardless of the council's assurances. However, many, including Lisa Davenport and Janette Vine, support the move for its accessibility and potential to encourage more foot traffic and community engagement. If approved, the library relocation could begin after April 2026, with funding assistance from the Arts Council England.
