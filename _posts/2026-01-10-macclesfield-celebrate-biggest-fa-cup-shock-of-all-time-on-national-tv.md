Macclesfield pulled off a stunning FA Cup upset by beating Premier League champions Crystal Palace 2-1 at Moss Rose. The Silkmen, who are 117 places below Palace and were reformed in 2020, took the lead with a powerful header from captain Paul Dawson just before half-time. Despite Palace making changes, Macclesfield doubled their lead as Isaac Buckley-Ricketts netted. Palace’s Christantus Uche had a goal disallowed for offside before Yeremy Pino scored a late free kick, but it was only a consolation. The victory sparked ecstatic celebrations as home fans flooded the pitch. This win marks the first time since 1908/09 that a non-league team has knocked out the FA Cup holders. With connections to Manchester United, manager John Rooney expressed pride in his team's performance, while Dawson highlighted the significance of the win for the community. They’ll find out their next opponents in the fourth round draw, which could be against City or United.
