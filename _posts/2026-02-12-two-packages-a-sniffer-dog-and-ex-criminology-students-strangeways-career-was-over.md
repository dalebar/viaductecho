Myra Shabab, a 26-year-old criminology graduate from Bury, attempted to smuggle drugs into HMP Manchester while working as a prison officer. Despite warnings about getting too close to inmates, she was pressured by an unnamed prisoner and believed she was just carrying cigarettes. On May 23, 2024, a sniffer dog detected the contraband, which turned out to be ketamine and cannabis worth between £5,800 and £9,600. Shabab, who had hopes of a career in the probation service, confessed to the smuggling attempt in the dock at Manchester Crown Court, expressing remorse. Judge Tom Gilbart acknowledged the exceptional circumstances of her case, including her lack of prior convictions and personal struggles, resulting in a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, along with 200 hours of unpaid work and 10 days of rehabilitation.
