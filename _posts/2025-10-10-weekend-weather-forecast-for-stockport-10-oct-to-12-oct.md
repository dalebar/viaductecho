This weekend in Stockport looks mostly partly cloudy with mild temperatures. Friday kicks off with some early morning rain, then clears up to a max of 16°C and a min of 10°C, with humidity at 86% and winds around 12 mph—perfect for a wet weather coat if you're heading out early. 

Saturday stays partly cloudy without any rain, temperatures hitting 15°C during the day and dropping to 9°C at night. Winds ease off to 6 mph, making it lovely for being outdoors. 

By Sunday, it's more of the same—partly cloudy, getting up to 16°C and dipping to 6°C at night with light winds of 4 mph. Humidity will be a tad higher at 88%, but still dry.

So, if you’re off out, the weekend’s shaping up nicely for walks, cycling, or a cheeky picnic after Friday's rain. Just don your waterproofs early on Friday, and you’ll be grand!
