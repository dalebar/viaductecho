Stalybridge town centre is getting a significant upgrade with plans for a new 171-space multi-storey car park on Waterloo Road. Tameside Council's proposals are part of an ambitious scheme to enhance the area and promote growth. The car park, designed by TODD Architects, will replace the current surface lot and feature standard, accessible, and electric vehicle spaces, along with motorcycle parking. A new pedestrian route along King Street will improve navigation to the car park, linking it better with Stalybridge Clinic and Waterloo Road.

Accompanying this development is a previously proposed pedestrian and cycle bridge over the River Tame, aimed at improving connectivity. There's also a £11.1m plan to rejuvenate the western edge of Stalybridge, which includes new housing and enhanced public spaces. Coun Andrew McLaren highlighted the ongoing efforts to make getting around easier and making Stalybridge a more vibrant place. This car park project is a key aspect of the Stalybridge Capital Regeneration Programme, aiming to strengthen transport links and better connect the town centre.
