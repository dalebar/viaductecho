Two men tragically lost their lives in a terror attack outside Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester, where a car was driven into bystanders before the attacker began stabbing them. The deceased have been identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. The attack happened on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police and was found to be in possession of a non-viable explosive device. The investigation is ongoing, with police treating the incident as terror-related and trying to understand the motivation behind it. Four others were injured, with three in serious condition in hospital. Authorities have increased police presence in the area to provide reassurance to the local Jewish communities and ensure their safety. Community leaders are working to support the families affected during this difficult time.
