A survivor of the Manchester Arena bombing, who is now paralysed from the waist down, recently met Coronation Street stars. The soap is currently featuring a storyline about a character, Tyrone, who has experienced a spinal injury. This storyline was developed with guidance from the Spinal Injuries Association, which helped the writers with research and scripting. The bombing, which occurred in May 2017 during an Ariana Grande concert, sadly resulted in 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries. Fans can catch up with the latest from BBC Radio Manchester on various platforms, and theyâ€™re encouraged to share stories via WhatsApp.
