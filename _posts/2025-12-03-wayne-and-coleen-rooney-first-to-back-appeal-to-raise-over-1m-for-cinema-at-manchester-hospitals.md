The Rooneys have jumped on board with Freddie Flintoff's exciting appeal to raise £1m for a new cinema, the MediCinema, for hospitals in Manchester. Flintoff's vision is to create a 50-seat, fully accessible cinema for patients at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary, bringing joy to those stuck in hospital for long stretches. He believes donating just £2 this Christmas could help hit the target and make a real difference. The cinema will be built in an old lecture theatre and feature comfy seating, wheelchair space, and screenings tailored for everyone, including sensory-friendly options. Kathy Cowell from the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust highlights the lasting positive impact this cinema will have on countless patients. Donations can be made via text or through the charity's website. It's a passionate push from Flintoff and supporters to make the hospital experience a bit brighter for many.
