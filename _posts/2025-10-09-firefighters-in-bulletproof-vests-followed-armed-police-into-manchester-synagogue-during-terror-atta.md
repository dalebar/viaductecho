After last Thursday's terror attack, firefighters from Agecroft fire station swiftly stepped in to assist armed police at the Heaton Park synagogue, which was targeted by Jihad Al-Shamie. Initially responding to a different emergency, they found the crashed vehicle and a casualty, donned bulletproof vests, and entered the synagogue to provide first aid and evacuate worshippers. This incident marked a significant improvement in emergency response since the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, which had attracted criticism for the slow arrival of fire services. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham praised the firefighters' bravery and highlighted the importance of updated training and equipment to prepare for potential terrorist events. Community gatherings took place to honour the two victims, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, with Rabbi Daniel Walker delivering a heartfelt speech against letting evil prevail. Burnham also noted that an investigation found no misconduct among armed officers during the incident, commending their professionalism in preventing further loss of life.
