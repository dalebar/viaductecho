A group of six men involved in an organised crime gang has been convicted of money laundering at Manchester Airport, hiding massive sums of cash inside DVD cases. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) revealed that while £430,925 was seized, it’s estimated that between £10 and £15 million may have been smuggled out over several months. The men used a fake company, Express Logistics Fulfilment Ltd, with no legitimate business, to export cash to Dubai via several UK airports. The operation came to light in January 2019 when Border Force officers examined suspicious consignments. The head of the group, Asad Saddique, alongside deputy leader Haroon Iqbal, coordinated the smuggling efforts, while others were responsible for packing the cash and transporting it. They've all pleaded guilty or have been found guilty of money laundering. The CPS plans to recover the illegally obtained assets linked to their crimes, highlighting the impact of such operations on organised crime. Sentencing is set for later this month at Minshull Street Crown Court.
