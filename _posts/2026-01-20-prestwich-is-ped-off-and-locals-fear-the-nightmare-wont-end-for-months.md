Businesses on Fairfax Road in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, are facing significant challenges due to ongoing construction works that began on October 13. The partial road closure is disrupting trade, particularly during a quiet time for hospitality. Local business owners, like Andrew from Croma and Sean from Panama Hatty’s, say customers are mistakenly assuming they're closed, leading to a massive drop in trade. They feel the organisation of the works has been poor and say consultation with them has been minimal, affecting not only their businesses but the wider community. A petition started by Sean gathered over 1,000 signatures, urging Bury Council and developers Muse to reconsider the weekday closure which is isolating residents and harming local trade. While the council acknowledges the frustration, they cite safety concerns as the reason for not opening the road during weekday evenings. They’re exploring ways to mitigate congestion, like implementing clearer signage. Despite the challenges, both the local council and developers insist the long-term benefits will be worthwhile once the regeneration project is complete.
