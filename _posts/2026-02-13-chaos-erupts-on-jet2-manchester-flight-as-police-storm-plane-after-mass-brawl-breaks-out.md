Two unruly passengers were kicked off a Jet2 flight to Manchester after a brawl erupted on flight LS896 from Antalya. The incident, which was caught on video, shows multiple passengers getting involved in the chaos, with shouts and attempts to defuse the situation. The flight had to divert to Brussels due to the disturbance, and police intervened to remove the two men, who have since been banned from flying with Jet2 for life. The airline plans to recover costs from the passengers linked to the diversion. Jet2 has reiterated its commitment to a zero-tolerance policy for disruptive behaviour, expressing regret for the experience of other customers and crew on board.
