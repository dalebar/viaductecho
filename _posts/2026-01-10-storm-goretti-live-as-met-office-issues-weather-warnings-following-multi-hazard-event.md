Storm Goretti has left a trail of weather warnings across the UK after causing chaos with snow, hail, heavy rain, and winds up to 99mph. Greater Manchester experienced road closures and disrupted train services as the storm moved east. This weekend, the Met Office has issued an ice warning for the region until midday today, cautioning about partially thawed snow refreezing and freezing fog. Additional warnings cover much of the North of England, Wales, and parts of Scotland until Sunday afternoon. Wintry showers may continue to pose further risks, and there's some uncertainty about additional precipitation on already frozen ground. Keep an eye out for travel updates and stay safe!
