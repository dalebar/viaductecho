Gary the mischievous Siamese cat has been reunited with his owner after three months of roaming Bury town centre, all thanks to dedicated local volunteers from Kitty Rescue Bury. Gary went missing in August, leading his owner to believe he was stolen. However, by November, security staff had spotted him scavenging for takeaway scraps around the shopping centres. Founder Chantelle and her team embarked on a lengthy search, setting up feeding routines and tracking Gary’s movements. After tirelessly looking for him in the early hours, they finally caught him using a trap lured with food. The team laughed with joy when a vet scanned his microchip and confirmed his identity, allowing them to return him to his heartbroken owner. She was delighted, and Gary's safe return brought happiness to his feline friend at home. Chantelle highlighted the importance of microchipping pets, stressing it can mean the difference between finding a lost pet or experiencing heartbreak. Kitty Rescue Bury, staffed by a dedicated group of volunteers, continues to support local feral cats, driven by the love for animals and the joy of reunions like Gary’s.
