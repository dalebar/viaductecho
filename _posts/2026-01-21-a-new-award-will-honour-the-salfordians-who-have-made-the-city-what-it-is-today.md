Salford is launching the Salford Centenary Award to recognise everyday contributions that shape the city as it celebrates its 100th anniversary this April. The award aims to honour the people, neighbourhoods, culture, and civic institutions that define Salford's identity. Councillors have endorsed the idea, with Mayor Paul Dennett emphasising the significance of community spirit. The award will be presented later in the year at the refurbished Buile Hill Mansion. A panel, including councillors and local leaders from various institutions, has been created to oversee the award, which will be given out in autumn 2026. This initiative provides a unique opportunity to acknowledge Salford's long history and resilience, aiming to highlight multi-decade and collaborative achievements that often go unnoticed. Meanwhile, readers are encouraged to engage with local news through various platforms offered by the Manchester Evening News.
