Dosa Kings in Sale has temporarily closed after multiple diners fell ill, prompting a significant emergency services response on September 6. Police, fire crews, and paramedics arrived around 12:40pm to assist those affected, with reports indicating that while most reactions were minor, one person was more seriously impacted. Investigations are ongoing, but authorities have ruled out a gas leak as the cause. Initially, at least eight people were reported unwell, but this number has since risen to double figures, with none being seriously ill. The restaurant acknowledged the situation in a brief statement on social media, apologising for the inconvenience and expressing appreciation for customer support. The matter is now with Trafford Council following the initial police response.
