The Class Ceiling report highlights the struggles of Greater Manchester's working-class talent in the creative sector, warning that without changes, the region risks losing its vibrant cultural identity, much like the talents of local icons such as Peter Kay and the Gallagher brothers. Led by University of Manchester chancellor Nazir Afzal, the inquiry revealed barriers like low pay, limited connections, and fewer gig venues, fueled by a gentrified arts scene. The report shared insights from over 150 artists, showcasing feelings of despair and hope. Alarmingly, 44% of creatives reported insufficient earnings to live on, and many had faced discrimination based on class. Among 21 recommendations, the inquiry calls for recognising class as a protected characteristic, boosting apprenticeships, and ensuring fair opportunities across the arts. Speakers at the launch emphasised the urgent need for real change, advocating for improved access to employment in arts roles that currently demand financial investment for entry. The report aims to reintegrate arts into mainstream culture and ensure equitable funding, pushing back against a narrative dominated by privilege.
