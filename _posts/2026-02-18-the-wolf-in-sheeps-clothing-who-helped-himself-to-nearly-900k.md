Richard Shaw, a former council worker from Bolton, defrauded nearly £900,000 from vulnerable benefit claimants and the council over several years. Described as a ‘wolf in sheep’s clothing’, the 47-year-old used his position in the finance protection team to divert funds into his own accounts, instead of managing benefit payments for those in need. Shaw flaunted his ill-gotten gains on luxury items, including two BMWs and a holiday home, while also spending over £53,000 on various third-party women. His fraudulent activities came to light in early 2023 when concerns were raised about irregular transactions. Once investigated, police uncovered a scheme where he transferred money from council and deceased users' accounts to his own, ultimately affecting around 217 service users. He was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison, with a Proceeds of Crime hearing set to recover the stolen money. Bolton Council stated they had robust measures to prevent such crimes and ensured that any financial losses to individuals were refunded.
