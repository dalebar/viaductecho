A 26-year-old dad-to-be, Luke Allman, caused chaos during a gender reveal party in Stockport when he stabbed security staff at a bar. After indulging in cocaine and drinking ten pints, Allman was asked to leave the venue but returned shortly after brandishing a knife, threatening to kill everyone. He stabbed one doorman, who now fears returning to his job, and a female bouncer ended up in psychiatric care for two weeks due to the trauma. Allman was sentenced to nine years in prison after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm and possession of a flick knife.
