A lively crowd gathered in Denton’s Vault 3, ready for the Gorton and Denton by-election launch with Reform UK's Matt Goodwin as their candidate. The bar buzzed with classic tracks while Goodwin highlighted his local roots, including his pizza delivery days while studying at the University of Salford. He proclaimed the by-election a referendum on Labour's Keir Starmer, especially in light of recent political scandals that led to the resignation of long-serving MP Andrew Gwynne.

Recent polls show a boost for Reform UK, especially with Labour's decision sidelining Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham from the race. As Labour considers its candidate, Goodwin promotes his party's stance on key issues, including transport, while distancing Reform from the traditional political establishment. Critics, including Labour's Lucy Powell, warn that Goodwin’s approach could sow division in Manchester. The contest for this constituency is shaping up to be intense, with the by-election set for February 26.
