Drivers in Bury, listen up! Expect delays on the A56 Walmersley Road leading into town due to five sets of roadworks. Bury Council's put up temporary traffic lights from Chesham Road to just south of Park Farm Tea Rooms as they tackle a mix of planned upgrades and urgent repairs. They’re urging everyone to plan ahead, allow extra travel time, and consider alternate routes if possible. The council aims to wrap things up between February 23 and 27. Additionally, Cadent Gas is also working on repairs near Bass Lane, warning of further delays expected to finish by February 24. Stay patient out there!
