Hey, just wanted to share some cool archive footage I found on YouTube featuring Stockport in the '60s and '70s, especially Heaton Moor. You’ll see its iconic shopfronts and the impressive library, though some spots might need a keen eye to spot! The video’s from Kinolibrary, a UK agency for archive clips. Not exactly breaking news, but thought it’d be a nice post-Christmas treat.
