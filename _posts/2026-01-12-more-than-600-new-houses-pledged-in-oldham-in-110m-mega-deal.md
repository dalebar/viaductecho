First Choice Homes Oldham (FCHO) has announced plans to build at least 600 affordable homes and refurbish thousands more after securing a £110 million deal with Santander UK. The funding will enable FCHO to create a mix of affordable housing and social rent homes in and around Oldham, while also enhancing the energy efficiency of their existing stock of 11,500 properties. Executive director Andy Ewart highlighted that this investment supports their homes strategy for 2025-2028, aligning with government goals for social and affordable housing. Notably, a significant portion of the funds is allocated for a project at Southlink, which plans to develop 147 energy-efficient homes on the site of the former Mumps railway station, with a mix of flats and houses. The project aims for over half of its homes to be available for social rent. Additionally, FCHO aims to improve energy performance ratings of its properties by 2030. This funding comes shortly after FCHO joined JV North, a consortium focused on delivering new homes as part of the government’s £39 billion initiative.
