A family in Manchester got quite the scare when they were trapped in a lift at the hospital car park after their son Arthur had surgery. Graham and Maria Crocker, along with their three-year-old, found themselves stuck for 45 minutes. After trying to alert the staff for help and growing increasingly worried about Arthur's oxygen levels, Mr Crocker eventually called 999. Thankfully, firefighters from Moss Side arrived shortly after and rescued them quickly. Mr Crocker expressed his frustration, especially given that Arthur had just undergone an operation. A spokesperson for the NHS Trust acknowledged the incident and said theyâ€™re looking into the lift malfunction, thanking the family for their patience and the fire service for their swift response.
