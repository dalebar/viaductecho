Detectives spent six months tracking a major drug operation in north Manchester, leading to the collapse of a £1.8m empire. Police raided a flat and uncovered a vast array of hard drugs including cocaine and heroin, along with significant cash and ammunition. Nine individuals were arrested, with the mastermind, Thomas Hunt, believed to have fled abroad. His cousin Dylan Robinson managed day-to-day operations, while other gang members, including associates with links to gangland figures, played key roles. Notably, officers seized over £1.8m worth of drugs, including 11kg of cocaine at the flat and extensive stock in storage units. Sentencing has occured, with varying terms including prison and suspended sentences, underscoring the seriousness of their crimes. The police emphasised their determination to dismantle organised crime and are actively pursuing Hunt for arrest.
