This week, Greater Manchester saw some exciting development plans. In Chadderton, Ram Mill is getting a makeover, aiming to transform part of the historic cotton mill into a hotel and apartments, complete with flexible work areas. In Audenshaw, a new Lidl supermarket is in the pipeline, ready to replace a restaurant with planning permission granted for demolition. Bury's Northern Gateway project is gearing up with a £3m investment to enhance access, expected to generate 10,000 jobs and over 6.5 million sqft of industrial space. Meanwhile, an ugly car park in Manchester is set to be replaced by stylish skyscrapers offering 1,041 student bedrooms. Over in Birtle, The Bird pub could become a new nursery, enhancing community facilities. In Sale, plans are underway to replace a B&M store with a block of apartments. Exciting times ahead for the region!
