Manchester Piccadilly is set for nine days of major disruption, closing most of its platforms until February 22 for upgrades. Trains from the south and east are halted, with services terminating at alternative stations like Stockport, where Avanti West Coast trains from London Euston are currently running. 

Adding to the chaos, two signalling faults near Manchester have led to delays of up to 30 minutes affecting multiple train operators, including Avanti, Northern, and TransPennine Express. Although some platforms remain open with a reduced service, the overall atmosphere at Piccadilly is unusually quiet, with barriers closed and few passengers around.

Rail replacement buses are in place, and National Rail suggests planning ahead for travel during this period. The upgrade work, costing £7.9m, aims to ensure safer and more reliable journeys in the future. Keep an eye out for live updates as the situation progresses!
