A man was hospitalised with stab wounds after an incident in Heaton Norris, Stockport, at around 12.30am on December 20. Thankfully, his injuries aren't thought to be life-threatening or life-changing. Greater Manchester Police are still piecing together how he got hurt, and a 37-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of assault and is being questioned. Forensics were spotted on Athol Street, and officers conducted door-to-door inquiries. Authorities believe the incident is isolated.
