A new pub, 'The Station House,' will open in Cheadle Hulme on Tuesday, 21 October at 9am, taking over the former Platform 5 site. After a Â£1.3m revamp, it boasts a classy 1930s vibe, with ornate decor, a brass and marble bar, plush leather booths, and a 100-seat outdoor terrace for those lovely days. Managed by Almond Family Pubs and Joseph Holt, the new venue aims to deliver quality food and drink in a lavish setting. Doug Almond, founder of Almond Family Pubs, expressed excitement about the grand design and the warm, welcoming atmosphere guests can expect. Richard Kershaw, CEO of Joseph Holt, highlighted that this partnership marks an exciting evolution for the pub. Bookings for The Station House are now open on the Almond Family Pubs website.
