Greater Manchester faced disruptions today due to heavy snowfall and plummeting temperatures, dropping to nearly -6C. Schools, including Golborne St Thomas' CE Junior and Infant School, closed due to heating issues, while drivers dealt with road closures and rail delays. The A57 Snake Pass was shut, and up to five flights from Manchester Airport were cancelled, including routes to Amsterdam. The Met Office issued a weather warning for snow and ice, advising people to allow extra time for their journeys. Despite the wintery conditions, Manchester Airport continued operating but advised passengers to check with their airlines for updates.
