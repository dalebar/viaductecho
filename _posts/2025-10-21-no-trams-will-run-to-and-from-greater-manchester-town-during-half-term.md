No trams will be running between north Manchester and Bury for six days, starting this weekend, due to essential work on the tram line. From Saturday, October 25 to Thursday, October 30, services will be suspended between Crumpsall and Bury. Replacement buses will be available to help passengers get to their destinations, continuing to Victoria for seamless travel. This closure is to facilitate beam replacement at the Whitefield Metrolink tunnel and construction on a nearby substation at Heaton Park, which is part of upgrading the entire light rail system. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) has also been working on other enhancements, like the redevelopment of Bury Interchange and upgrades to lines and tracks. Ian Davies from TfGM emphasised the importance of these upgrades for the growing demand on the Bee Network. He advised passengers to plan ahead using the Bee Network app or website while apologising for any inconvenience.
