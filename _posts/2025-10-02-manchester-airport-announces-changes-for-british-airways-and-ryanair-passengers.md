Manchester Airport's Â£1.3 billion revamp of Terminal 2 is nearing completion, with some exciting changes for British Airways and Ryanair passengers. From October 7, British Airways will move operations to Terminal 2 alongside Aer Lingus, Luxair, and Finnair. Passengers can look forward to new restaurants and shops, like Joe and The Juice and a Lego store, as they will benefit from the upgraded terminal experience. 

On October 21, Ryanair passengers will switch to the Terminal 1 Departures A entrance for check-in and security before heading to Terminal 3's lounge, which will still have all its shops and eateries open. 

As Terminal 1 will close after the revamp, it will soon become part of the Terminal 3 experience. Meanwhile, Terminal 3 itself is undergoing a multi-million-pound transformation, featuring 40% more seating, new security, and a massive sports bar called Sporting Chance with airfield views. Exciting times ahead for all travellers at Manchester!
