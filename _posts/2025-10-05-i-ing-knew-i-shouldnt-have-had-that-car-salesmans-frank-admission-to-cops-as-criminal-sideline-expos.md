Vincent Parkes, a car salesman from Northwich, has been jailed for 30 months after police discovered £2,000 worth of cocaine and heroin hidden in his underwear during a strip search. Parkes was already under investigation for being a main drug dealer in the area when officers stopped him in his Audi SQ5. They found not just the drugs but also cannabis, digital scales, cash, two phones, and prescription drugs. Despite trying to dispose of the drugs before his arrest, he admitted to their presence during questioning, claiming the cash was his wages and that the scales were for personal use. He pleaded guilty to various charges related to drug possession and distribution. Following his sentencing at Chester Crown Court, Police Constable Chris Box highlighted the teamwork of the officers involved and stressed the commitment to tackling drug-related crime in the community.
