This week saw some serious sentences handed down by the courts. Kieran Naylor, a violent rapist, was jailed after brutally attacking a woman who sadly died without seeing justice. Other offenders included a fraudster, Adam Moore-Lynch, who scammed over £1 million from customers through a Ponzi scheme, and a drug dealer, Philip Brown, caught using his drugs line phone to call police about his bail. There was also Benjamin Walsh, who led cops on a chaotic 16-minute chase before crashing into their vehicle. However, not all stories are about the worst; a determined dad, Vincent Gavin, tracked down the robber of his van, helping police secure a conviction. Meanwhile, in Chester, arsonist Christopher Payne got over two years for torching a building. A drug dealer named Sean Farrell, previously on the run in Spain, has finally been arrested. Lastly, Rhys Hicks was jailed for a fearsome naked rampage that left onlookers distressed. Quite the lineup of cases, innit?
