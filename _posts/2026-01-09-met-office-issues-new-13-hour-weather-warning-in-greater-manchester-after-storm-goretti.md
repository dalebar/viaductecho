Forecasters have set a new weather warning for parts of Greater Manchester following Storm Goretti. While the worst hit areas have avoided severe conditions, some eastern parts saw overnight snowfall and are now under a yellow warning for snow and ice this weekend. This warning kicks in at 2am on Sunday, January 11, lasting for 13 hours. The Met Office anticipates travel disruptions and icy surfaces, with snow expected mainly on higher ground. Northern England could see 2cm to 5cm of snow, and up to 30cm in the hills, especially in Scotland. Conditions are expected to vary due to elevation and precipitation. Storm Goretti's effects linger across the UK, with ongoing warnings, including an amber snow warning for the Midlands and Wales, and a yellow warning for eastern Greater Manchester. Stay safe and keep an eye on the weather!
