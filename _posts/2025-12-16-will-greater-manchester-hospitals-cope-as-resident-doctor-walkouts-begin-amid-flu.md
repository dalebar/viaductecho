Greater Manchester's hospitals brace for a five-day strike as resident doctors walk out starting tomorrow at 7am. This comes amidst a surge in flu cases, with regional health leaders encouraging vaccinations. Despite potential chaos, some senior NHS officials believe A&E performance might actually improve, as more experienced consultants fill in. Dr Michael Gregory, Regional Medical Director for NHS England, has reminded the public to use NHS 111 for non-urgent needs while continuing to attend emergency services as necessary. However, routine appointments and elective surgeries are likely to be disrupted.

The strike, the 14th since March 2023, occurs despite a new government offer, with a significant majority of BMA members voting to continue industrial action. This follows frustrations over pay, as the BMA argues that resident doctors' salaries, although risen nearly 30% in three years, still lag behind inflation. Meanwhile, the Health Secretary has called the strikes "self-indulgent" during a particularly challenging flu season. Both the BMA and NHS leaders emphasise the commitment to patient safety throughout the strike.
