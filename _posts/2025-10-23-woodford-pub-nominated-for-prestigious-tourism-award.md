The Davenport Arms in Woodford, also known as the Thief's Neck, is vying for the 'Pub of the Year' award at the Cheshire Tourism Awards 2026. Managed by Robinsons Brewery, the pub is a popular spot for food, drinks, and special events like weddings and birthdays. Edward Bromley from Robinsons expressed excitement about the recognition and support from the local community. The awards celebrate Cheshire's thriving tourism sector, which contributes Â£3.9 billion to the economy and supports 38,000 jobs, with over 56 million visitors each year. Jamie Christon, chair of Marketing Cheshire, noted the remarkable quality of submissions this year, making the judges' job tough. The winners will be revealed at a ceremony on March 5, 2026, at Walton Hall and Gardens.
