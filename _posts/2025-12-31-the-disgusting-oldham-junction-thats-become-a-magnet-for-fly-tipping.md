Residents in Oldham are frustrated with a public bin at the junction of Napier Street West and Coppice Street, which has turned into a hotspot for fly-tipping. Locals describe the area as a 'disgusting' eyesore, with rubbish piled up between the bin and a clothes donation box. One resident, Addy Shan, argues that the bin’s presence encourages people to dump their waste improperly. This problem has persisted for over four months, despite council clean-ups. Others agree, suggesting that fly-tippers misuse the location knowing the council will ultimately clear it. While fly-tipping is illegal and subject to hefty fines, Council Deputy Leader Elain Taylor acknowledged the residents' concerns and mentioned ongoing efforts to combat the issue. She highlighted the relaunched "Don’t Trash Oldham" campaign aimed at cleaning up the borough and restoring community pride. Though there’s no confirmation yet about removing the bin, the council is committed to working with locals to tackle this growing problem.
