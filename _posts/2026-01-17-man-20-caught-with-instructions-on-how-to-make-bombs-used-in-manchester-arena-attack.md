Adam Mahmood, a 20-year-old from Birmingham, has been sentenced to four years in prison for possessing a video detailing how to make explosives similar to those used in the Manchester Arena bombings. He was described as "obsessed with weapons," with police finding a 15-minute instructional video, ball bearings, and various medieval weapons in his home. Mahmood, who had over 27,000 followers on social media, was arrested in April 2023 after his extremist content drew police attention. The court highlighted his significant interest in prohibited terrorist organisations and the potential danger posed by the material he possessed. Despite claiming he just skimmed through the video, experts deemed it an accessible guide for creating explosives. His defence argued that he was a vulnerable young man needing guidance, rather than a mastermind behind terror plots. Judge Simon Drew KC reinforced the risk Mahmood posed, extending his licence period beyond the prison term. Counter Terrorism Policing expressed concern over the easy accessibility of such dangerous content on social media platforms like TikTok.
