Shah Bahram, a prospective Oldham Council candidate, is ramping up his home security after his car was set ablaze in a 'targeted arson attack.' The incident occurred while he was home, reportedly ill with flu, and his wife alerted him to the fire outside. Two masked individuals were seen fleeing the scene after dousing the vehicle with petrol and igniting it. Bahram has previously experienced similar attacks, including one at his mother's home the same night. He suspects the attacks are linked to his political ambitions with the Oldham Group, a prominent opposition faction. Despite feeling fearful for his family, including his newborn, he remains determined to run for election, encouraged by community support. Greater Manchester Police are investigating the incidents, describing them as targeted but reassuring the public that there’s no wider threat. They’ve urged anyone with information to come forward.
