The inquest into the death of Salford 'Mr Big' Paul Massey, who was shot in 2015, has faced yet another delay, frustrating his family. They welcomed a review of sensitive police intelligence, hoping it might finally address concerns surrounding his murder. Paul Massey was killed amid a violent gang war involving the A-Team and the Anti A-Team, and his family has fought for a comprehensive hearing for over a decade. Senior coroner Timothy Brennand highlighted the importance of reviewing police intelligence regarding a 'Threat to Life' warning prior to Massey's death. The inquest was initially set to begin on March 23, but complications in appointing a specially-vetted barrister led to the postponement. Massey's daughter Kelly expressed her frustration but remained determined to seek justice for her father, stating that continued efforts are necessary. She believes the inquest could provide the answers they’ve long sought. The coroner acknowledged the family's substantial concerns and the need for a thorough examination of the evidence to ensure proper judicial process. Another pre-inquest review is scheduled to take place on what would have been the original hearing dates.
