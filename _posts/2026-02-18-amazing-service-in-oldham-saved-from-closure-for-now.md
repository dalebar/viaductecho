The planned closure of a beloved day care centre for adults with learning disabilities in Chadderton Hall Park is currently on hold due to public backlash. MioCare, the council-owned provider, suggested cutting the service as part of efforts to mend a £20 million budget shortfall. Following a significant outcry, including support from families and local figures like MP Jim McMahon, the council decided to pause the closure plans. Care worker Amanda Shelley, whose brother Mark attends the centre, expressed relief and plans to campaign for necessary building repairs, as maintaining the centre costs £150,000 annually. Councillor Barbara Brownridge acknowledged the community's concerns and committed to exploring alternative savings while ensuring support for users of the service. However, there's no set timeline for a final decision on the centre's future, as more information is being gathered to assess the proposals.
