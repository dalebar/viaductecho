The Dragons have brought in Will Austin, a former Wales Under-20s player, on a short-term deal to help with their hooker crisis ahead of the match against Leinster. Austin, who has a background with Colwyn Bay and captained Swansea University's BUCS Super Rugby side, previously played as a substitute for the Ospreys against Leinster in February. The Dragons' lineup for the match features captain O'Brien and includes players like C Evans, R Williams, and Young, among others.
