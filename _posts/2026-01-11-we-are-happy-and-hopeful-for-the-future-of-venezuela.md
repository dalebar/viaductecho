Over a week ago, news broke that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken by US forces, bringing a glimmer of hope to millions of expatriates. Adolfo Marquez, a former barrister who fled due to threats linked to his legal case against Maduro, expressed his relief. He moved his father to keep him safe after facing food shortages. Adolfo's friends back home reported increased police scrutiny over public support for the US operation, but he now dreams of returning with his daughters. Helena Diez from the Andes, now in Salford, highlighted the efforts of the Venezuelan diaspora to aid their loved ones but stressed the need for international support. Roger Munoz, in Castlefield since 2015, recounted the personal loss of his father due to lack of medical care. All three share a cautious optimism about the future of Venezuela.
