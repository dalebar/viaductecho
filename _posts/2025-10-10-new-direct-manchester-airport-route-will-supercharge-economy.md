Manchester Airport is kicking off direct flights to Delhi, India, aiming to boost economic ties between the two nations. This follows a new trade deal between the UK and India that’s getting praise from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who's currently visiting India. Starting in November, there will be nine weekly direct flights operated by IndiGo, India’s largest airline, making Manchester the only airport outside London with services to both Mumbai and Delhi. 

The airport’s Managing Director praised this as a significant move for regional businesses and the local economy, expected to generate tens of millions in economic value. Leaders, including Jo Ahmed from the Manchester India Partnership and the Indian Consul General, highlighted the importance of these routes for trade and cultural ties. Manchester City Council's leader, Bev Craig, added that these flights would greatly enhance Manchester’s already strong connections with India. In short, this new route is set to create more opportunities and drive growth across the North.
