Oldham Athletic's owner, Frank Rothwell, has big plans for the town, envisioning a massive 20-metre statue inspired by the Angel of the North, dubbed the "Oldham embryo," to celebrate the world’s first IVF baby born there. He discussed these ideas with the Prince of Wales while receiving an OBE for his fundraising efforts for Alzheimer’s research. Rothwell aims to make Oldham a better place and has proposed a royal garden party in Alexandra Park to mark the NHS’s 80th anniversary and Louise Joy Brown’s birthday. The sculpture will be designed with input from local schoolchildren and will sit alongside the M60 motorway, aiming to raise Oldham's profile and attract businesses to the area. Rothwell, known for rowing solo across the Atlantic, believes the statue will grab attention and spark curiosity about Oldham. His goal is to put the town on the map with a striking landmark that invites questions and recognition.
