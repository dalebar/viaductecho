Big changes are on the way for Stockport train station, with a major redevelopment project starting soon. This busy hub, connecting Manchester and London, will see over £4 million in government funding aimed at improving access and the overall user experience. Local MP Navendu Mishra and Edgeley councillors have emphasised the need for investment to enhance the station's condition.

Plans include better pedestrian connections on the Edgeley side, a new ramp from Thompson Street, and upgrades to the platform and services. The redevelopment is a collaboration between Stockport council, Transport for Greater Manchester, Network Rail, and Avanti, with hopes it will lead to job creation and further investment in the area.

Stockport council leader Mark Roberts emphasised the project's significance, aiming to transform Stockport into one of the UK’s best-connected towns. This station revamp comes alongside a broader £1 billion regeneration scheme in the town centre, which includes new homes and business spaces.
