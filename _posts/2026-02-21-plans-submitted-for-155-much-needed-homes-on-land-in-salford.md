Plans have been submitted for up to 155 much-needed homes at Hazelhurst Farm in Worsley, Salford, by Story Homes, alongside an overall plan with Taylor Wimpey for 330 homes. The local community has raised concerns about traffic and infrastructure, with residents noting existing road issues and overstretched services. Half of the proposed homes will be affordable, aimed at families, and there are plans for a new primary school and improved roads, with Story Homes potentially contributing £7.2m to local facilities. Adam Galleymore from Story Homes mentioned their goal is to create a sustainable, well-connected community with plenty of green space. Previous proposals for more homes at the same site faced significant pushback, highlighting ongoing tensions over development in the area.
