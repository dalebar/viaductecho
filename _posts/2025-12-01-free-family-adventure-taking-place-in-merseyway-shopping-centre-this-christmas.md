Oh no, the gingerbread men have gone missing! But don’t worry, Merseyway shopping centre is hosting free trails for kids on the weekends of 6-7, 13-14, and 20-21 December. Starting at 11am, little ones can help Mrs Claus find the gingerbread men by following a trail map, with elves guiding them along the way. The hunt wraps up at the Gingerbread House, where families can meet Father Christmas and grab a treat from Mrs Claus’ shop.

Plus, Merseyway's getting festive with extended opening hours from 18-23 December, running from 9am to 7pm. There are also festive huts in the outdoor area selling delicious goodies and gifts. 

Getting there is easy—just hop on the bus to Mersey Square or walk from the Interchange under the A6. Enjoy the festive fun!
