Greater Manchesterâ€™s hospitals are now on lockdown due to a major incident following a stabbing at a synagogue on Middleton Road this morning (October 2). A car reportedly drove into the public, resulting in one death and another person in critical condition. Armed police shot the suspect, who has also died. The lockdown involves Salford Royal, Fairfield General, Rochdale Infirmary, and Royal Oldham hospitals, as local authorities declare a major incident. Security measures have ramped up, restricting movement in and out of hospital sites as a response to the emergency. The police are investigating the possibility of terrorism linked to this incident, which occurred during Yom Kippur, a significant day in the Jewish calendar. Mayor Andy Burnham confirmed police responded swiftly to the scene.
