Stockport drivers are facing a hefty load of parking fines, with over 23,000 penalties issued from June 2024 to June 2025, bringing in Â£801,290 for the council. Princes Street topped the list with 483 fines, followed by Grenville Road with 339 and Lancaster Street with 310. Meanwhile, Stockport NHS Foundation Trust is rolling out new measures to tackle parking issues at Stepping Hill Hospital, including reintroducing parking enforcement officers. They aim to ease congestion with new barriered car parks for staff, promote alternative parking solutions, and improve public transport options. Gareth Hughes, the director, emphasised the need for safety and a better experience for everyone visiting the hospital, considering the site sees a staggering 5,900 staff and numerous patients daily.
