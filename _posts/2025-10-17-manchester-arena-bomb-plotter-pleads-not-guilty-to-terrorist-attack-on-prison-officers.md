Hashem Abedi, linked to the Manchester Arena bombing, has denied attacking prison officers with hot oil and makeshift weapons at HMP Frankland on April 12. Appearing via video link from Belmarsh prison, the 28-year-old pled not guilty to multiple charges, including attempted murder and assault. During the alleged incident, Abedi reportedly shouted 'Allahu akbar' and used cooking equipment to launch the attacks. Prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward KC indicated the case's terrorist connections and highlighted Abedi's extremist views, stemming from his past conviction related to the Manchester bombing. The trial is set for January 18, 2027, and Abedi was remanded in custody without legal representation, indicating he doesn't wish to attend the hearings. He is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the 2017 attack that killed 22 people.
