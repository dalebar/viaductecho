Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester Mayor, is hosting a 'Mayor's Question Time' on Thursday, 18 September at Edgeley Park, starting at 7.30pm. It's free to attend, and the public can submit questions when registering to join. An independent local journalist will shortlist the questions to cover a diverse range of topics. Attendees can also ask additional questions during the event. It's suggested to register ahead of time, but walk-ins are welcome if there's space. These events happen every three months at various locations across Greater Manchester. The Mayor's office encourages everyone to share their concerns. For more info and registration, check their official website.
