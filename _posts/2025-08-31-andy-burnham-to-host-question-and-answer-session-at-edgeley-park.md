Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham will be hosting a question and answer
event at Edgeley Park.

'Mayor's Question Time' will take place on Thursday 18 September from 7.30pm,
and will be free to attend.

During the event, the mayor will answer questions submitted by members of the
public.

Audience members can submit a question when they register to attend - these
questions will then be shortlisted by an independent local journalist and put to
the mayor on the day.

The organisers say this is to ensure that "a broad range of topics are covered
on the night".

There will also be an opportunity to ask other questions during the evening.

Those taking part are asked to submit only one question, and to keep it concise
and on-topic.

It's recommended that visitors register to attend in advance - however, if there
is room, people can walk in on the day.

Mayor's Question Time events are held every three months at different locations
across Greater Manchester.

"This is your opportunity to have a voice on the concerns that matter to you",
the Mayor's office says.
