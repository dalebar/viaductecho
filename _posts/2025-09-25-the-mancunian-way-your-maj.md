Andy Burnham's keeping a low profile ahead of the Labour Party Conference, limiting appearances to avoid ruffling feathers. He recently gave interviews expressing political ambitions and sharing bold ideas, including higher taxes for southern homes and a top rate on income tax, which some see as a challenge to Keir Starmer. While Burnham remains committed to his role as Mayor of Greater Manchester, recent public support suggests he could have the backing to pursue a leadership position. His popularity surged during his clash with Boris Johnson over Covid restrictions, making him somewhat of a local hero. However, questions linger about whether he can successfully sell his vision nationally, especially with pressing local issues like homelessness and transport still needing attention. On the transport front, his plans for a railway between Manchester and Liverpool have faced delays, which he finds disappointing. Other local news includes potential job losses at TalkTalk's wholesale arm and some updates on upcoming events, like the reopening of the Power Hall at the Science and Industry Museum.
