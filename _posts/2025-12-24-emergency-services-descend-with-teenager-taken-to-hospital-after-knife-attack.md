A teenager was taken to hospital after an attack in south Manchester on Tuesday evening. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) received reports of the incident on Manchester Road, Chorlton, just before 5.30pm. A 17-year-old boy suffered facial injuries requiring two stitches, reportedly from a small knife, but his injuries are not life-threatening or life-changing. The attack might have occurred at a different spot, and GMP is currently investigating the details. No arrests have been made, and the scene has since been cleared.
