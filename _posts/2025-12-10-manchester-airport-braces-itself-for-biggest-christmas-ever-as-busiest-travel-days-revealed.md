Manchester Airport is gearing up for its busiest Christmas yet, expecting over 1.5 million passengers between December 19 and January 4. With peak travel days predicted on December 19 and 28, over 100,000 flyers are anticipated each of those weekends. Surprisingly, even Christmas Day will see 85 departures and around 35,000 passengers, primarily heading to Dubai. The holiday rush follows a record-breaking November with 2.2 million travellers, and 96% waited less than 10 minutes at security. Most passengers will travel through the massive new £1.3bn Terminal 2, which has nearly all airlines onboard except Ryanair. Managing Director Chris Woodroofe shared his excitement about the festive atmosphere that fills the airport, while also highlighting the importance of checking in early and packing smartly. He wished all passengers a joyous Christmas and noted improvements continuing in Terminal 3. It’s sure to be a lively and vibrant season at Manchester Airport!
