Seven men have been sentenced in Rochdale for the grooming and rape of two girls, who are now adults. The men, including Mohammed Zahid, who received a 35-year sentence, were found guilty after a five-month trial where both victims bravely testified. Prosecutors described the girls as being treated like 'sex slaves', having faced severe exploitation during their troubled upbringings. Zahid, a market stall holder, raped both girls and facilitated further abuse. The group primarily included market stall holders and taxi drivers from the area. 
During the trial, the judge highlighted the vulnerability of the girls, noting that they had been failed by authorities meant to protect them. He condemned the appalling treatment they endured and affirmed the need for public confidence in protecting vulnerable children and punishing offenders. While Zahid and the others faced justice, one accused, Bashir, is still at large, having skipped out before the trial. It's a grim reminder of the need to safeguard the young and vulnerable in society.
