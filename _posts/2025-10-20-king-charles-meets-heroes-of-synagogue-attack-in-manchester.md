King Charles recently visited Manchester to meet those affected by the Heaton Park synagogue attack on Yom Kippur. He was warmly welcomed by Rabbi Daniel Walker and crowds outside the Crumpsall synagogue. The monarch met emergency service workers and victims, including Bernard, a security guard, and Yoni Finlay, who was accidentally shot while aiding the barricade. Charles shared heartfelt moments with those injured and strengthened community support with his visit. He presented a bottle of whiskey to the synagogue, which in turn gifted him a framed print in memory of the late Queen. Afterward, he visited Greater Manchester Police headquarters, where he spoke with first responders and heard about their efforts. Key figures, including the Chief Constable and community leaders, joined him as they discussed inter-faith dialogue and community healing. The visit was marked by an uplifting atmosphere, emphasising unity and shared humanity, with many expressing gratitude for the monarch's presence during such a challenging time.
