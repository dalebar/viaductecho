This week (January 19-22), several motorways and major A-roads in Greater Manchester will be closing for overnight maintenance. National Highways has announced that the M56, M60, M62, M67, and A627M will be affected, alongside the A5103 and A666. Most closures start between 9pm and 11pm and end by 5am or 6am, so plan your journeys accordingly, especially if you're an early bird or a night owl. A detailed list of closures includes multiple entry and exit slip road closures on the M60, and junction closures on the A-roads too. Keep an eye on local traffic updates and plan your routes ahead to avoid any hassle!
