Manchester City Council has launched a ‘key amnesty’ for those illegally renting out social housing. Until February 27, tenants can return their keys without facing penalties, part of a campaign against tenancy fraud that’s affecting housing availability. Over 21,600 residents are waiting for social homes, with some waiting nearly six years. There’s a worrisome trend, especially among young people aged 18-25, some of whom face homelessness due to unaffordable private rentals.

The council estimates that 3-6% of social tenancies could be fraudulent, equating to about 4,200 lost homes for those in need. This includes tenants subletting or living elsewhere while renting. Coun Gavin White emphasised that fraud harms families and costs the Council significantly, money that could support local services.

After the amnesty period, the Council plans to intensify enforcement, investigating more fraud cases and pursuing legal action against offenders. They’re working closely with housing providers to address the situation. Tenants interested in the amnesty or suspects of being victims can find more info on the council’s website.
