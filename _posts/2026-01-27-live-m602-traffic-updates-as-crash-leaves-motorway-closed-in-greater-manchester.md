There’s been a right kerfuffle on the M602 out of Manchester, causing long queues during rush hour. A multiple vehicle crash at junction 2, near Gilda Brook Road in Trafford Park, led to the westbound carriageway being closed while emergency services responded. Fortunately, the injuries reported were only minor. 

Traffic was diverted, but now the good news is that the road has reopened, although you might still face delays of around 20 minutes as things get back to normal. Just keep an eye on updates if you're heading that way!
