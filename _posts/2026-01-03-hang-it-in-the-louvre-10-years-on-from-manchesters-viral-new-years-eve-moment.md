Ten years ago, a photo by Manchester journalist Joel Goodman outside Printworks captured the wild spirit of New Year's Eve 2016, featuring a chaotic scene with police and onlookers. Initially just part of a gallery, it went viral after BBC's Roland Hughes shared it on Twitter, reaching fans globally, including sci-fi writer William Gibson and star George Takei. The image is often hailed as a ‘modern-day Renaissance masterpiece,’ encapsulating the energy of Manchester nightlife. Over time, it sparked discussions and recreations, notably around recent Oasis events. Goodman reflects on its unexpected popularity and how it’s celebrated the city’s character, even amid life changes since its inception. Both he and Hughes express doubts about replicating such virality today, noting shifts in public perception regarding authenticity. Yet, they agree the photo remains a true representation of Manchester’s charm and chaos, admired for Goodman’s skilled framing and lighting.
