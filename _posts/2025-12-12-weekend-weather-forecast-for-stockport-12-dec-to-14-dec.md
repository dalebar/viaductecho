This weekend in Stockport looks a bit mixed, weather-wise. Friday kicks off with some rain, clearing later in the day. Expect highs of 11°C, lows of 6°C, and a pretty high 100% chance of rain in the morning, so take an umbrella, yeah? 

Saturday brings more clouds, with temps from 9°C to 5°C. There’s an 85% humidity and a moderate chance of rain at 32%, plus winds picking up to 21 mph, so a light jacket should do the trick. 

Come Sunday, it stays cloudy but the temp stabilises, sitting between 9°C and 10°C. The chance of rain drops to 39%, but winds rise to 24 mph, making it a day for staying indoors, really.

Commuters should be cautious on Friday morning with the wet roads, and just a reminder—be careful on Sunday with those gusty winds. If you fancy being outside, Saturday's your best bet, but have some backup indoor plans ready for Sunday!
