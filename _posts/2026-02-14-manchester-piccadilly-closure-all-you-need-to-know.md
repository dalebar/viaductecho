Manchester Piccadilly station is undergoing a significant £7.9m upgrade, leading to some train services being halted for nine days. From 14th to 22nd February and again on 1st March until noon and 22nd March until noon, platforms 1 to 12 will be closed. This affects services to London, the Midlands, and the east. However, platforms 13 and 14 will remain open with limited routes to Liverpool, Blackpool, and Chester (Sundays only). The station's facilities, including the ticket office and retail outlets, will remain operational.

During this period, detailed alternative travel options and rail replacement buses are available on Northern's website. There'll be ten extra buses running on the 192 route and trams will operate as usual. Transport for Greater Manchester is allowing rail tickets to be used on select bus and Metrolink services. Passengers are advised to travel light, allow extra time, and brace for busy conditions as the disruption unfolds, especially for events at the Etihad Campus.
