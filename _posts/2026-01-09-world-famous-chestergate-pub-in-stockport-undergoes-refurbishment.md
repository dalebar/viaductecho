The Chestergate pub in Stockport is getting a makeover! Closed since 5 January, it's set to reopen on 16 January after a big refurb. A spokesperson reassured patrons that it's still the beloved Chestergate everyone knows, just getting a classy update with a new colour scheme and a painted ceiling. The pub is well-known for its viral karaoke nights and was a favourite haunt of the late Molly, the "Dancing Queen," who had a dedicated fan base before her passing in September 2025. Keep an eye on their Facebook page for updates!
