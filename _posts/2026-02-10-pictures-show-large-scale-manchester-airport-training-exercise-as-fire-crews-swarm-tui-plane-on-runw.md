A significant training exercise took place at Manchester Airport, simulating a plane crash scenario involving multiple casualties. The exercise, named Operation Icarus, featured a TUI jet positioned on the runway with volunteer actors in high-vis vests "evacuating" from the aircraft. Key emergency services, including Greater Manchester Police, Fire Service, and North West Ambulance, participated, surrounded by fire appliances and responders. While the exercise temporarily operated on a single runway, it didn’t disrupt regular flights. It aimed to create realistic conditions to prepare for potential major incidents, reinforcing passenger safety as the top priority. The airport’s Operations Director, Rad Taylor, emphasised the importance of readiness for serious events, stating this comprehensive drill was designed to mirror a real emergency response. The exercise highlighted the collaborative efforts of emergency services in a practical setting. Another session is scheduled for Thursday, although it may not be visible to the public.
