Three men were stabbed in Chadderton, Oldham, on the same night, with attacks occurring in less than two hours. Thankfully, their injuries weren't life-threatening and two arrests have already been made. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have implemented a Section 60 order, granting them additional stop-and-search powers through to Saturday evening. The first incident involved a 21-year-old man who was stabbed in a retail park car park just before 7:30 PM. Earlier, a 26-year-old was attacked in Butler Green shortly before 6 PM, followed by a third stabbing on Featherstall Road North at 7:30 PM.
