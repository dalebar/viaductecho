Plans for Manchester Metropolitan University’s new All Saints Library have been scaled back, now set for nine storeys instead of the initially approved 13. This change follows rising construction costs that made the original proposal unviable. The library is intended to feature the first public poetry library in the North West, alongside gallery and event spaces. The new design will have a striking ‘zig-zag’ look, aiming to create a vibrant hub for learning and collaboration on campus, but the anticipated opening has shifted to September 2030. MMU is committed to refining their plans through community engagement to ensure the library meets students’ evolving needs.
