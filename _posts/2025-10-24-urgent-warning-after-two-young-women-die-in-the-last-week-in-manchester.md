An urgent warning has been issued after two young women tragically died in Manchester, believed to be linked to MDMA powder. This alert was announced by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and shared by Mandrake. The specific causes of the deaths remain unknown, and the women’s identities haven’t been disclosed yet. Tests on MDMA samples found a wide range of purities, from 4% to 77%, making it hard to determine a safe dose. The warning prominently states that "MDMA kills," with 78 fatalities linked to the drug last year, many occurring without the use of other substances. To ensure safety, the panel advises against using MDMA altogether, but if one chooses to use it, they should look after their mates and check local support services for advice.
