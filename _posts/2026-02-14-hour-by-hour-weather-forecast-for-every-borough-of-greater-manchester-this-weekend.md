Greater Manchester is in for a mixed weekend of weather, with sunny spells on Saturday turning to snow overnight and a grey Sunday. There's a yellow warning for snow and ice across Greater Manchester and much of northern England and Scotland, as an Arctic air mass brings colder conditions. Expect snow from 1am on Sunday, though it’s unlikely to settle in most areas. Some travel disruptions are anticipated due to snow, particularly in higher regions. Accumulations of 1-3cm may occur at lower levels and 3-7cm at higher elevations. Ice is another hazard, especially in parts of Scotland and north-east England. The Met Office predicts milder air will follow the snow by sunrise, transitioning into rain. The detailed hourly forecast suggests a chilly Saturday morning with temperatures around -2°C, rising to 5°C in the afternoon, before the snow starts late Saturday night. Keep your coat handy for a stonkingly cold yet bright start, but be ready for that wet and wintry mix by Sunday!
