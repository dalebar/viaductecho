Rochdale is all set to welcome its first real ice rink in 20 years this Christmas at the Town Hall Square, launching on November 21 as part of Santa's Village. The rink is open to skaters aged four and up, with hireable aids for little ones under 120cm. Families can also book visits to Santa’s Grotto nearby for a cosy festive experience. The Ignite Fire Festival will run alongside, featuring spectacular fiery displays and a magical illuminated trail from November 21 to 23, culminating in a Christmas lights switch-on on the final night. Tickets for the ice rink are £9.50 for kids and £13.50 for adults, with sessions lasting 45 minutes. The rink operates Friday to Sunday until mid-December, then daily from December 19 to January 4, excluding Christmas and New Year's Day. It's a fantastic opportunity for families to enjoy some festive fun in Rochdale this year!
