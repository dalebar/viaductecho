Stretford town centre is buzzing with new businesses set to open soon as part of its regeneration efforts. Four exciting additions include national brands like Holland and Barrett, opening on January 20, and Specsavers on February 14, along with local independent Ebonies, which will specialise in beauty supplies. There's also a new community health hub from Harry’s Pharmacy arriving at the end of February, offering various essential services. They’re joining existing spots like Fountain Records and Costa Coffee, with the much-anticipated 'Northern Light' cinema opening in March. The refurbished multi-storey car park will welcome visitors from January 19. Local leaders are thrilled about the new retail options, hoping they’ll enhance the shopping and leisure experience in the area. With strong support from the council and Bruntwood, Stretford’s business landscape is looking vibrant and inviting!
