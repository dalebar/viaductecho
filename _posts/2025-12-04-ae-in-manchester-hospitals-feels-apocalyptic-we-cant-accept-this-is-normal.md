A&E in Manchester is currently overwhelmed, with reports of waits nearing 50 hours. Patients are stuck in a hot and chaotic environment, where the focus is less on symptoms and more on the misery of waiting. The mix of severe cases and those unable to access a GP only adds to the tension. After triage, many feel lost in a fluorescent limbo with little communication, creating a distressing atmosphere. Despite the annual winter crisis being downplayed as a seasonal issue, this ongoing chaos is more about systemic failures than the weather. The dedicated hospital staff are clearly stretched thin, often seen in tears apologising for delays. It’s a striking failure that Manchester deserves better than 50-hour waits and unsafe conditions. Time for proper action to tackle this long-standing problem.
