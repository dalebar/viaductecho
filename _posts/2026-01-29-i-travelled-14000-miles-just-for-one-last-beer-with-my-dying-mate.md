Bob Walker made a heartwarming journey from Jakarta to Arbroath, Scotland, to see his old mate, Peter Gould, who’s battling terminal cancer. Despite being over 7,000 miles away, Bob jumped on a plane just to share one last pint together on January 16. Their friendship spans 40 years, having first met while working as aircraft engineers in Papua New Guinea before reuniting at Manchester Airport in 1996. Bob fondly recalled the good times they shared, reminiscing over their favourite South Pacific Lager, which he managed to source for their reunion. Peter's daughter, Amanda, was touched by Bob's gesture, noting it’s a rare thing to see such dedication. Bob expressed how important Peter has been in his life, especially during challenging times in Manchester. Their bond truly showcases the power of friendship over distances and hardships.
