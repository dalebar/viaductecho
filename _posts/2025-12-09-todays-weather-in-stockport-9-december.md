Tuesday's weather in Stockport is looking quite grey and drizzly. Expect mild temperatures between 10°C and 14°C, but with a high humidity of 81% and a 100% chance of rain, you'll definitely want to grab your brolly. The day kicks off with some clouds and a bit of sun, but it won't be long before the rain sets in. 

Winds will be strong, hitting up to 30 mph, which might make it feel a bit chillier than it is. If you're commuting, be careful of wet roads and reduced visibility; it's a good call to allow for extra travel time and keep a safe distance from other cars. 

If you're planning anything outdoors, it might be smart to consider indoors activities instead, or at least have a solid plan for staying dry. Think snug evenings with a book or a cuppa while the rain falls outside. Stay safe and keep those weather updates handy!
