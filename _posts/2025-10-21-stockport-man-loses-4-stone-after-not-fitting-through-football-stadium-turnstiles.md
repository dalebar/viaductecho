Mark Brockbank, a 52-year-old dad from Stockport, has completely turned his life around, shedding nearly four stone in nine months using the Simple app. He felt the need to make changes after worrying about fitting into a plane seat for a friend's wedding. Instead of strict diets, Mark embraced the app's AI coaching, making small lifestyle tweaks that boosted his health without feeling restrictive. 

Now, he enjoys better mobility, plays cricket, goes swimming, and can even navigate football turnstiles with ease. He appreciates Simple for its user-friendly design, supportive features like NutriScanner, and the friendly AI coach, Avo. With a current goal to lose a total of eight or nine stone, he feels accomplished with his progress and believes this transformation has positively impacted his family life as well. The app's success is highlighted by over 17 million downloads and praises from users for its motivational tools. Mark's journey proves that small changes can lead to significant life improvements!
