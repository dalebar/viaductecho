Keri Muldoon's story from a decade ago highlights the chaos of the 2015 Boxing Day floods in Greater Manchester. Her home was inundated, leaving her and her kids with nothing but memories, as they navigated the aftermath for months. The floods impacted thousands, with severe damage and emergency responses stretched thin. Storm Desmond and Storm Eva combined to wreak havoc, flooding 2,250 homes and businesses, and costing the region £11.5m in infrastructure damage.

Experts emphasise that climate change has triggered more intense rainfall, making flooding a more common occurrence.

It's a challenging situation, but the community spirit and adaptability shine through in their response.
