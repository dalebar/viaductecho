A chaotic scene unfolded at a car meet in the Manchester Airport tunnels on Sunday evening, December 14, prompting a heavy police response. Around 100 onlookers, including children, gathered as a convoy of roughly 40 cars zipped through the tunnels at high speed. Eyewitnesses described the atmosphere as 'mayhem', with cars racing and revving their engines for about 10 minutes. The police arrived, blocking off the road and deploying stingers to halt some vehicles. One car was seized, and three warnings were given to vehicle owners. A police spokesperson confirmed the incident and their response, which left the area at a standstill for around 30 minutes.
