Marple's NHS clinic is set to temporarily move to a unit in the Brabyns Brow Upper Middlers car park from the new year until Autumn 2026. After that, it’ll shift to the new Marple Community Hub, which is currently under construction. The hub will feature a five-lane swimming pool, a library with a café, a 60-station fitness suite, and communal spaces, along with the relocated clinic. Construction is being handled by Willmott Dixon, who are also creating apprenticeship opportunities for locals. The project is partly funded by a government Levelling Up grant.
