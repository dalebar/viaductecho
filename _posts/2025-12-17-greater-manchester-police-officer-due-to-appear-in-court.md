A Greater Manchester Police officer, PC Dyllan Powell, aged 30, is in court today facing charges of misconduct in public office after an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). He allegedly gave false information to a custody sergeant, which resulted in a member of the public being wrongfully charged on 17 February 2024. The IOPC noted that the investigation, prompted by a referral from the police, wrapped up in April 2025 and led to a file being sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, which authorised the charge in October. PC Powell will appear at Leeds Crown Court on 17 December. Further details haven’t been disclosed yet.
