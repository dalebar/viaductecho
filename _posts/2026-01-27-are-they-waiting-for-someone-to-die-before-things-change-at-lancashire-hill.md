A recent fire at the Bentleys apartment building in Lancashire Hill has raised serious safety concerns among residents, already anxious from two incidents this month. Fire crews from Greater Manchester, including an aerial appliance from Bolton, tackled the blaze, which reportedly started due to a faulty laptop charger. Green Party Councillor James Frizzell highlighted ongoing fire safety issues in the area, such as missing fire doors and poor ventilation, prompting a change in evacuation protocols. Residents voiced their fears of a potential catastrophe, citing past incidents and their diminishing trust in Stockport Homes, the social housing landlord. Local authorities, including councillors from both parties, have called out the mismanagement of fire safety and a lack of investment in the most deprived estate in Greater Manchester. Despite assurances from Stockport Homes regarding repairs and safety protocols, the community feels let down, with many residents expressing frustration over living conditions and safety risks. The local council has initiated an investigation into these matters, emphasizing the importance of accountability and improvements moving forward.
