Tameside's latest planning meeting gave the thumbs up to several housing projects, resulting in nearly 70 new homes. Two apartment blocks will rise in Ashton, one with 12 flats on Wellington Street and another with 33 flats on Stamford Street Central. Meanwhile, a housing estate with 25 homes in Mossley has had its plans slightly downsized to ensure financial viability. 

A controversial house of multiple occupation (HMO) in Ashton was rejected due to inadequate living conditions and concerns about oversaturation in the area. Councillors were particularly worried about parking issues, especially with nearby schools.

Additionally, the planning panel approved a new energy storage facility in Dukinfield, aimed at enhancing grid flexibility by storing electricity when demand is low. They also granted changes to operating hours for a self-storage site in Denton that was previously damaged by fire. Lastly, a former retail space in Ashton will be transformed into flats, preserving its street-facing charm. Overall, the panel's decisions reflect a balance between community needs and development.
