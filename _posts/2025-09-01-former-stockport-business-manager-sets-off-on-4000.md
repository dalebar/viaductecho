Jo Worrall, a retired school business manager from Stockport, is gearing up for an incredible adventure, sailing 40,000 miles around the world as part of the 2025 Clipper Race. This annual event welcomes participants with little sailing experience, offering them training to prepare for the challenge. Jo, now part of the Yacht Club Punta del Este team, explained she wanted a fresh start after her divorce and decided to sell her house to embark on this journey. The race, starting from Portsmouth, will take around 11 months and will expose Jo and her crewmates to extreme weather conditions across six oceans, all while living closely together on a yacht. With stops including places like Cape Town, Fremantle, and Seattle, Jo expressed her excitement about doing something just for herself after years of family obligations. The Clipper Race aims to make sailing accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds, contributing to a diverse group of participants from around the world.
