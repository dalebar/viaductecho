Jo Worrall, a retired school business manager from Stockport, is gearing up for an incredible adventure: sailing 40,000 miles around the world in the upcoming 2025 Clipper Race. This annual event welcomes participants with limited sailing experience, offering them training before they embark on a challenging journey across six oceans. Departing from Portsmouth on 31 August 2025, Jo is part of the Yacht Club Punta del Este team, led by professional sailors David Sautret and Lorraine O’Hanlon. 

Having embraced this journey following her divorce and a desire for self-discovery, Jo, who has some sailing background, is excited about the trip. The race itinerary includes stops in various global locations, from Spain to South Africa, the Philippines, and even Washington, DC, before returning to Portsmouth next summer. The Clipper Race aims to break down barriers to sailing, inviting participants from diverse backgrounds to experience this extraordinary test of human spirit. Jo’s story highlights the adventurous spirit and determination that fuel this unique event.
