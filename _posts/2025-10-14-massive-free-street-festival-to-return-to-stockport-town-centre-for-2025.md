Stockport town centre is set to host its third 'Spectacular Sunday' event on 16 November. Running from 11am to 5pm, this free street party will feature performances by festive bands, giant puppets, and various street entertainers across multiple locations like Market Place and Merseyway. Last year’s event attracted over 50 groups and marked the busiest day for footfall since 2019. A spokesperson from Stockport Council promised a full day of free entertainment to kick off the Christmas season, urging everyone to join in on the fun. Director Stuart Braodbelt expressed excitement about last year’s turnout, despite the rain, calling it a magical day filled with amazing acts for all ages. Don't miss this festive celebration!
