Police shut down Vernon Road in Bredbury, Stockport, after reports of a significant 'puddle of blood' on the pavement, with two vans at the scene near The Queens pub. Witnesses noted the blood while the pub's front doors were closed due to the situation, though the back doors remained open. Police have been on the scene since 4pm. The incident doesn't appear to involve the pub directly. Greater Manchester Police have been contacted for further details.
