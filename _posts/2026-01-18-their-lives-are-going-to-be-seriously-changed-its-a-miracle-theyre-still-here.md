A tragic car crash in Bolton on January 11th left four dead and several injured, including a 54-year-old taxi driver and three teenagers in another vehicle. The taxi's passengers have survived but face life-altering injuries, which has deeply affected their loved ones, who are now hesitant to drive. Lucie Wilson, a friend of the injured, highlighted their struggle and the community's support, setting up a fundraiser to help with costs as they anticipate long recoveries. Georgina and Tom Daniels, a newlywed couple, are among the injured, now separated due to their medical needs and coping with shock while too recovering in hospital. The investigation into the crash is ongoing amidst claims of reckless driving, with a speed-related video emerging as part of the evidence. Community donations for the Daniels and the others have quickly reached nearly £30,000, with plans for continued support as they navigate this painful chapter in their lives.
