An elderly man was taken to hospital after escaping a house fire in Wigan. The fire brigade was alerted to the blaze on Coniston Avenue in Ashton-in-Makerfield around 3pm on January 7. Three fire engines from Wigan, Hindley, and Leigh arrived to tackle the flames engulfing both floors of a semi-detached house. The man managed to self-rescue before firefighters arrived and was flown to hospital by air ambulance. Firefighters are still on scene, working to control any remaining hotspots and ensure the safety of the building and nearby properties. A cordon remains in place while they finish their checks.
