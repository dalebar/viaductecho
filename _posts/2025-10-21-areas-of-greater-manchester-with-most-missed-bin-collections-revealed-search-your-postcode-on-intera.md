Last year, councils in Greater Manchester faced over 115,000 missed bin collections, with Manchester City Council recording the highest number at 22,736. Trafford had the worst missed collection rate per capita, despite having a smaller population than Manchester and Salford. The overall UK figure for missed collections exceeded 10,000 each working day, attributed to factors like strikes and weather. While some councils praised their bin collectors for handling millions of successful collections, critics, including the TaxPayers' Alliance, expressed frustration over the missed services. Barnsley stood out with the most missed collections nationally, tallying 146,000. Local councils like Tameside and Bury highlighted their commitment to improving services and acknowledged challenges like blocked roads and severe weather. Some councils are working on better technology to track missed collections, while others are introducing measures to help residents with bin schedules. Overall, there's a mixed picture of satisfaction and frustration regarding waste collection services across the region.
