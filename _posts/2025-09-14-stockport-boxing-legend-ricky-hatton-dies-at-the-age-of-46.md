Tragic news as Stockport boxing legend Ricky Hatton has been found dead at his home in Tameside, aged 46. Police responded to a call early this morning and stated there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his passing. Hatton, who held multiple world titles in the welterweight and light welterweight categories, was also dedicated to mental health advocacy post-retirement, famously opening a new mental health wing at Crumpsall Hospital just this March. Though his identity hasn't been officially confirmed yet, the loss of such a local hero is deeply felt.
