Mobile phone footage has surfaced showing a violent altercation among students at Stockport College. The conflict erupted when two boys clashed, leading to fists and kicks flying inside and outside the college, while others joined in the chaos. Security staff struggled to intervene, and one staff member tended to an injured student on the ground. Greater Manchester Police received reports shortly before noon, confirming they found no weapons involved despite initial claims of a stabbing. Nine teenagers, aged 16 to 18, have been arrested on suspicion of affray. One concerned parent, whose 15-year-old son witnessed the brawl, described the situation as "scary," noting how quickly it escalated. Carmen Gonzalez-Eslava, the college principal, reassured that the incident was managed effectively and that normal classes continued. Despite the unsettling event, no serious injuries were reported, and police are coordinating efforts to support students and staff at the college.
