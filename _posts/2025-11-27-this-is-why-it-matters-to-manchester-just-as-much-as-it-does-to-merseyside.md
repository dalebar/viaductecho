The Hillsborough Law is important for Manchester, as emphasized by Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, linking it to the aftermath of the 2017 Manchester Arena attack. Lammy highlighted how bereaved families had to "drag the truth" from the system, much like those affected by Hillsborough. An amendment to this law will extend the "duty of candour," compelling public bodies, like the police, to provide all relevant info, acknowledge mistakes, and correct them. This comes after the Kerslake Report, which revealed issues with Greater Manchester Police’s handling of information post-Arena bombing. Mayor Andy Burnham is advocating for equal funding for bereaved families facing state legal resources and continuing to push for the Hillsborough Law's strength. Lammy also noted parallels between the experiences of families in both tragedies, stressing the need for honest inquiries. The amendment aims to ensure that local authorities must also fulfil their obligations transparently. The law, at the committee stage in Parliament, seeks to honour the memories of both the 97 from Hillsborough and the 22 from the Arena bombing, ensuring families don’t have to fight for the truth ever again.
