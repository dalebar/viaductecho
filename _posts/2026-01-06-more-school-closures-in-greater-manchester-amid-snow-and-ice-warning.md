Two more schools in Greater Manchester have closed today due to heating issues amid a Met Office snow warning and plummeting temperatures. Corpus Christi RC Primary in Chadderton and Oasis Academy in Oldham both cited heating problems for their closure. Hollingworth Academy in Rochdale also shut down due to a burst pipe affecting heating. They expect to reopen tomorrow. Additionally, St Thomas' CE Junior and Infant School in Golborne, which closed yesterday for the same reason, has now resumed normal operations. Several schools across Lancashire and Cheshire are similarly closed. The Met Office continues to warn of scattered wintry showers and icy patches, potentially causing travel disruptions this morning, with small accumulations of snow expected in some high areas.
