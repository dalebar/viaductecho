Transport bosses in Greater Manchester are moving forward with a feasibility study for an underground network for Metrolink trams and trains, backed by a £375,000 commitment for initial studies. The idea is part of the Greater Manchester Rapid Transit Strategy, launched in July 2024, aimed at enhancing public transport through tunnelled options. The proposal includes various routes, like a tunnel aligning with the busy Bury and Altrincham lines and another near the Castlefield Corridor to Piccadilly, potentially emulating successful systems in Paris and London. There's also a proposed north-south tunnel serving Manchester Airport. The initial studies will explore demand and possible routes, with plans to meet capacity demands as the city's transport needs grow. Local councillors expressed support, noting the necessity for greater capacity in city centre transport to fuel future growth. While construction funding isn't yet available, the feasibility study indicates significant progress on Mayor Andy Burnham's vision to develop underground transport by 2050.
