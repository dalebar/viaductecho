Mark Pinder, a beloved figure from Blackley, was remembered during a heartfelt funeral attended by hundreds. Despite facing homelessness, Mark dedicated his life to helping others, especially the elderly, by cleaning streets and assisting with their daily needs. He passed away at 54, leaving a profound impact on his community. His funeral featured blue themes, in honour of his Manchester City fandom, and a tribute song. Friends and family, including close mate Kady, shared stories of his kindness and the many lives he touched. Following his death, his sister Stephanie spoke of the overwhelming love for Mark, highlighting his desire to remain in Blackley, where he felt at home. Locals are now advocating to rename a nearby woodland "Pinder's Woods" in his honour. A memorial has sprung up in the area, showcasing flowers and balloons. In Mark's memory, his family is also raising funds to support local charities and a soup kitchen, aiming to help families in need during Christmas. His legacy of kindness and community spirit will undoubtedly live on.
