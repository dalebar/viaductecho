Following the tragic deaths at a Crumpsall synagogue, responses in the Facebook comments varied widely. While many reflected Manchester's spirit of empathy and solidarity, some comments veered into conspiracy theories, suggesting Jews were somehow complicit in their own suffering. This victim-blaming narrative is rooted in long-standing antisemitic myths and discounts the real pain felt by the Jewish community. Comments linking the tragedy to the situation in Gaza or expressing hatred towards Muslims only serve to perpetuate bigotry and collective guilt, which is dangerous and unjust. These views, while appearing in public forums, are not representative of Manchester. The true heart of the city shines through those who stand up against hate and spread kindness. It's crucial to amplify these voices, ensuring that empathy prevails over prejudice, especially in tough times.
