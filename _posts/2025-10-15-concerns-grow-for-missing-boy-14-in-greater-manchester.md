An urgent appeal has been made for help in finding 14-year-old Jack, who has gone missing from Trafford. He was last spotted at 8pm on Tuesday (October 14) on Highfield Road in Stretford. Jack is described as white, 5ft 9ins tall, slim, with short brown hair. At the time he disappeared, he wore a North Face beanie, a sage green puffer coat, royal blue tracksuit bottoms, and black-and-orange Nike trainers. Greater Manchester Police are increasingly concerned for his safety and have shared his photo on social media. They are asking anyone with information about Jack's whereabouts to contact them by calling 101 and quoting log number 3364 of October 14, 2025.
