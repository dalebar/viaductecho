From October 1, all NHS GP surgeries in England must offer online consultations from 8am to 6.30pm, enabling patients to request appointments and ask questions digitally. The government hopes this will ease phone lines for urgent requests. However, some GPs express concerns about resources being strained, risking a decline in appointment time. Many local practices in Greater Manchester have varied online access; some closed requests once reaching capacity, while others only offered limited hours. Notably, Dr Valeed Ghafoor suggests that many practices still lack online services nationally, complicating the shift to a new system. The fear is that opening up online requests may overwhelm GPs, detracting from those with genuine urgent needs. Yet, some believe that online tools could help catch serious issues early, if managed well. NHS Greater Manchester supports this initiative and emphasises the importance of keeping non-digital options available for those who need them, reporting a healthy uptake of their app among residents.
