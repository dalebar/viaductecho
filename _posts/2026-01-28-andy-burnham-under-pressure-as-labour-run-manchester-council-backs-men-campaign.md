Andy Burnham's facing pressure from Manchester’s Labour council to back a campaign by the Manchester Evening News for free school travel for homeless kids in temporary accommodation over 30 minutes from their original school. Councillors have united in calling for Burnham to support this initiative, urging collaboration for a practical solution. The Evening News has pushed for free bus passes for affected children since last August, arguing no family should have to choose between transport costs and school stability. This added support comes as eight Greater Manchester MPs and various charities also advocate for change. The campaign highlights the significant stress families endure when displaced, with a focus on improving stability for these children. Local leaders are committed to addressing homelessness and enhancing support systems, hoping the mayor will include these provisions in his upcoming budget. The community is rallying behind the campaign, showcasing a collective effort to tackle these challenges head-on.
