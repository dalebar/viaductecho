Two police officers and a custody staff member were assaulted at Manchester Airport on New Year's Day while processing a man suspected of security breaches. They sustained various injuries, including a fracture and bite marks, and were taken to hospital but have since been discharged. A man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of assault and violating security protocols, and he remains in custody for questioning. Superintendent Helen Caldbeck condemned the assault, emphasising that emergency workers should be safe while serving the public, especially during the festive season. She reassured that the case will be pursued vigorously to deter such behaviour.
