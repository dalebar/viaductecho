UK ambassadors are promoting Greater Manchester globally to enhance trade links. The High Commissioner to Singapore visited recently, following a July trip by the UK Ambassador to Spain, as part of a government initiative to connect regions in the UK with international markets. The visit coincides with Greater Manchester's own trade missions to Singapore and Japan, led by Mayor Andy Burnham. 

During his tour, the High Commissioner, Nikesh Mehta, noted existing connections, such as a Singaporean company running local buses, and expressed hopes for stronger ties. He visited the Victoria North development and met with the University of Manchester for discussions on innovation. He highlighted Singapore's increasing investments in Manchester, including a significant investment in transport, and noted that Singapore is now the city-region's third fastest-growing services export market. Following the visit, Mayor Burnham emphasised Manchester's ambition and its importance as a trading partner, indicating a focus on growth, job creation, and innovation driven by international collaborations.
