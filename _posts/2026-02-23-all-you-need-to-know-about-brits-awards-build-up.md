The Brit Awards are making their Manchester debut this Saturday at Co-op Live, featuring performances from stars like Harry Styles. Leading up to the ceremony, Manchester is hosting its first Brits Fringe event called "Manchester Seen and Heard," which aims to elevate local talent and grassroots creativity. 

This includes the three-part "First Steps" series for young creatives aged 16-25, offering masterclasses and workshops in songwriting, audience building, and selling music. Events take place at venues like Band on the Wall and the Royal Northern College of Music, wrapping up with a music showcase featuring emerging acts on Friday.

Additionally, there are charity gigs from big names like Robbie Williams and Olivia Dean supporting War Child, alongside an art trail showcasing British music artwork across the city. A pop-up exhibition celebrating music design history is also on display at Manchester Piccadilly station until March 1. Advance tickets for the free exhibition can be booked online.
