Councillor Mark Roberts from Stockport Council believes the area would have received government aid for last year's New Year floods if it were located in the South. At a recent Cabinet meeting, he highlighted the struggle for support following severe flooding that led to mass evacuations and significant property damage. Despite the floods breaking local records, the government did not activate its Flood Recovery Framework, which typically provides grants for affected households and businesses. Roberts expressed frustration that the government’s focus appears skewed towards the South, leaving Northern areas like Stockport to fend for themselves. 

A recent 69-page Flood Investigation Report detailed the flooding causes and responses, noting that extreme rainfall overwhelmed drainage systems. The report recommends shifting towards natural flood defences and urges residents to bolster their own flood defences. With climate change increasing the likelihood of future flooding, Roberts insists that government support is crucial for effectively tackling these challenges.
