Duncan Craig, founder of the charity We Are Survivors, has been supporting male victims of rape and sexual abuse in Manchester, where Reynhard Sinaga targeted vulnerable young men. Sinaga, a PhD student, is serving a 40-year sentence for raping over 200 men after drugging them. Despite receiving significant media attention upon his conviction in January 2020, many, including law enforcement officials, remain unaware of his case, which surprises Duncan. He believes societal attitudes towards male victims, particularly young heterosexual men, contribute to this obscurity. Sinaga's methods included posing as a helper to lure victims to his apartment, where he would incapacitate them and film the assaults. The case highlights a troubling reluctance to discuss male rape, intertwined with issues of misogyny and homophobia. Duncan argues that the stigma surrounding male victims persists, emphasising the need for ongoing dialogue to break down barriers and raise awareness, especially as the number of male victims is often downplayed in discussions about sexual violence.
