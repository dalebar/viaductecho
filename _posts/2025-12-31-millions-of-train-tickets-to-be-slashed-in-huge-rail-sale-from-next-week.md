The Great British Rail Sale is back next week, from January 6 to January 12, 2026, with millions of train tickets discounted by over 50%. Passengers can travel on thousands of routes between January 13 and March 25, 2026. This year, more than three million tickets are available, making it perfect for winter weekends or half-term trips. Key fare reductions include journeys from Manchester Piccadilly to Manchester Airport slashed from £2.90 to £1.20, and Bolton to Manchester Piccadilly down from £2.50 to just £1. Alongside this, the government is freezing regulated rail fares until March 2027, meaning commuter savings of over £300 a year on pricier routes. This sale, now in its fourth year, is designed to ease the cost of living and improve public railway access. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander highlighted the importance of cheaper travel for everyone, whether visiting friends or planning a getaway.
