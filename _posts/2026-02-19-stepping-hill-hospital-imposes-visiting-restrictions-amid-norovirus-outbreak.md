Stepping Hill Hospital is tightening its visiting rules due to a spike in norovirus cases. Normally, they allow open visiting, but now only a few exceptions will apply, such as for patients nearing the end of life or those with learning disabilities or dementia. These restrictions are in place immediately and will be reviewed on 20 February. A spokesperson highlighted the importance of visiting for patients but stated that protecting vulnerable individuals and managing service pressures necessitated these changes. Additional cleaning measures are being implemented in the affected areas, and staff are focused on quickly identifying patients with symptoms. For more updates, check out the Stockport NHS website.
