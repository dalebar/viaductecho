Storm Amy is swinging by the UK today, bringing with it some heavy rain and winds up to 100 mph. The Met Office has warned of "disruptive wet and windy weather," likely causing travel chaos and flooding throughout the weekend. Weather warnings are issued across the UK, with parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland facing the worst of it under amber warnings for "damaging winds." Yellow warnings cover Greater Manchester and the rest of the country, starting from 3pm today. We can expect heavy rain of about 4 to 8mm per hour in Manchester and the north west, with warnings in effect through Friday night and into the weekend, clearing by Saturday night. Met Office chief forecaster Neil Armstrong highlighted that significant disruption is possible, especially in Scotland with gusts of 100 mph in some areas. Rainfall totals could exceed 30-50mm in western Scotland, heightening the flooding risk. Stay safe and keep an eye on updates!
