Bury council has announced road closures affecting Market Street and Church Lane due to ongoing building works. Church Lane will face partial closures from January 19th to March 27th, restricting access at its junction with Bury New Road, leaving one northbound lane closed. This is to facilitate landscaping after Metrolink tunnel repairs. Meanwhile, Market Street is already seeing restricted access as part of the £5.7m Bee Active Travel Scheme aimed at enhancing safety for pedestrians and cyclists. The scheme, funded by the UK Government and the Mayor’s Challenge Fund, comes just after bridge repairs in 2025. Bury Council acknowledges the frustration caused by these closures but assures that the improvements are essential for road safety, traffic reduction, and better access to local services. They intend to provide ongoing updates and notify the public about future closures, with a promise that twelve projects will wrap up by winter 2026.
