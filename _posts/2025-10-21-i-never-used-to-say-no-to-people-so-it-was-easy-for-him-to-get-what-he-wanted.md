In a Manchester court, a woman, referred to as 'Girl C', testified about her experiences as a schoolgirl with an alleged grooming gang in Rochdale, claiming she was drunk during encounters with Tahir Rashid, nicknamed 'Taz', who she said raped her multiple times at his home. The court heard recordings from her 2016 police interviews, where she described her friendships with other alleged victims and connections to older men she met at a snooker hall when she was around 13. She mentioned that she didn't often refuse advances from these men, including 'Wolfman' and another called 'Sucky'. The prosecution argues that these vulnerable young girls were exploited and shared among the men, who face multiple serious charges, all of which they deny. Rashid alone faces 12 counts of rape, demonstrating the troubling nature of the case.
