Thursday in Stockport is shaping up to be a damp and grey one. Expect overcast skies and steady rain, with temperatures peaking at around 14°C and dropping to about 9°C. It’ll feel quite chilly due to high humidity levels of 89% and blustery winds reaching 23mph. Definitely a day to have your umbrella and raincoat handy!

The rain won’t let up, so plan your day accordingly—perhaps stay inside if you can. If you’re commuting, be prepared for delays from wet roads and possible reduced visibility; checking public transport schedules in advance might save you some hassle. Remember to dress warmly if you do head out, and keep an eye on weather updates for any changes. Stay snug and dry!
