Manchester Piccadilly station was evacuated this morning (December 17) due to a report of a suspicious bag. British Transport Police arrived around 10am, setting up a cordon as a safety precaution. With police and search dogs on the scene, passengers were moved away while the situation was assessed. Fortunately, the bag turned out to be non-suspicious, and the incident was soon stood down. The station has since reopened, but disruption to train services is expected until about 11.15am, with delays and cancellations likely. Social media users shared their experiences, describing the chaos and safety measures in place. If you're travelling today, it might be a good idea to check for updates.
