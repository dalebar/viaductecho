The piece questions Sir Jim Ratcliffe's understanding of immigration, given his privileged lifestyle as a billionaire living abroad. His recent comments about immigrants “colonising” Britain have sparked outrage, especially in Manchester, a city enriched by immigrant communities throughout its history. Critics feel his non-apology only highlights his disconnect from the struggles of everyday Mancunians, further exacerbated by inaccuracies in his claims about the UK’s population. Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, seems out of touch with the club's diverse heritage and the global nature of modern football. There's a call to recognise that Manchester has thrived on inclusion and belonging, not exclusion or invasion. His comments are seen as hypocritical, suggesting he doesn't fully grasp the weight of his words and the realities faced by many. The article stresses the importance of discussing immigration, but highlights the responsibility that comes with wealth and public platform. It alludes to a more profound need for empathy and awareness, which Ratcliffe seems to be lacking.
