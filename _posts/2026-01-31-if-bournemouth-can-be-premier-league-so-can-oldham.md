Oldham’s got its sights set on becoming a sporting hotspot again, aiming for a return to the Premier League after years of decline. Oldham Athletic, founding members of the Premier League, dropped to non-league in 2022, but excitement is brewing after Frank Rothwell’s takeover. He's revitalised crowds and even erected an embryo sculpture to highlight Oldham's role in IVF treatment.

Recently back in the Football League after a dramatic Wembley win, plans for ‘SportsTown’ around Boundary Park are in the works, which includes a £70m centre for sports, education, and wellness, along with 2,000 new homes. This initiative, inspired by Leigh Sports Village, aims to develop local talent and attract other sports teams.

Local leaders, including Mayor Andy Burnham, are optimistic about Oldham competing with bigger clubs, especially given its larger population compared to Bournemouth. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority has also pushed for development in surrounding areas to enhance local growth and connectivity, making it a promising time for Oldham.
