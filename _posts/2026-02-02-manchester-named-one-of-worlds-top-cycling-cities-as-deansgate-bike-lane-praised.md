Manchester's making waves as a top cycling city, snagging 34th on the 2025 ‘Copenhagenize List’, just behind London at 33rd. The city's big push for biking comes after being named the European capital of cycling in 2024, with loads of cash thrown at new infrastructure, training, and events. The revamped Deansgate, turning it into a one-way for cars with a two-way cycle lane, won ‘best completed scheme’ from Walk Ride GM, despite some grumbles from taxi drivers and local businesses about traffic bumps. The council’s keen on showing that having the right setup boosts cycling—evident from an 85% increase in Chorlton after similar changes. Tracey Rawlins, the transport councillor, believes these changes help people cycle more, lead healthier lives, and tackle climate change, marking a fresh chapter for Manchester’s transport scene.
