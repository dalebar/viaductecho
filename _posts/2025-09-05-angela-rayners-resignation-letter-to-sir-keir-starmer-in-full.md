Angela Rayner has stepped down as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a second home. In her resignation letter, she expressed regret for not seeking specialist tax advice, taking full responsibility for the error. Despite an ethics watchdog stating she acted with integrity, Rayner faced growing pressure to resign after revealing she paid Â£40,000 less in stamp duty by incorrectly classifying her property. 

In her letter, Rayner reflected on her journey from a teenage mum on a council estate to high government office, highlighting her commitment to improving lives in working-class communities. She emphasized her pride in recent legislation aimed at enhancing workers' rights and protecting renters. Rayner thanked her colleagues and expressed a desire to continue serving the public and her party in the future, underscoring her dedication to making a difference for those from similar backgrounds.
