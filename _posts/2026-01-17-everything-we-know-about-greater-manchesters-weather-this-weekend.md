Saturday will kick off mostly cloudy with a sprinkle of showers, but by the afternoon, expect it to brighten up a bit with temperatures around 8C to 9C. Just a heads up, the easterly winds will make it feel more like 5C, so wrap up warm! The evening should see mostly dry conditions with some clearer spells, although clouds will roll in overnight, dropping to about 5C, maybe even 3C, but frost isn’t likely. 

Sunday starts off with some rain on the horizon, and it’ll be cloudy, with fog on higher ground. Prepare for heavy rain and drizzle as it progresses, especially in the Peak District and Greater Manchester around 9am, with a chance of hail in Bolton and Rochdale later. The temperature will cool to around 7C, feeling chilliest with lighter winds. As we roll into Monday, expect more rain and showers, though there'll be some brighter spots too. It should stay frost-free, but breezy weather will make it feel a touch cooler.
