Transport bosses and Network Rail are updating progress on the recently completed £20m Greek Street bridge over the West Coast Main Line in Stockport. The new structure, which replaces a 1958 bridge that had reached its limit, features advanced materials and was put in place during a 21-day rail closure in August. While the railway reopened last month, more work is in store, including two more days of closures on October 4 and 5 for further construction under the bridge and road reinstatement. William Brandon from Network Rail expressed pride in the project team and gratitude for community patience. Passengers are advised to plan their journeys ahead of those closure dates, with rail replacement buses available. The ongoing work aims to install parts of a new roundabout, with utility service diversions also planned as work continues towards spring 2026 completion. The local area remains accessible, with the railway set to remain open until Christmas Day and Boxing Day after the October closures.
