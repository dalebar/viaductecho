Salford's big regeneration project in Pendleton is in full swing, with 485 new homes being built in the Phoenix Quarter by Lovell Together. The development will offer a mix of one to four-bedroom homes, with 30 per cent reserved as affordable housing. It also includes over 140 properties for people aged 55 and above. Clarence Park is set for a revamp too, featuring a multi-use games area, skatepark, and play areas. These energy-efficient homes will be fully electric, boasting air source heat pumps and solar panels. Residents are expected to move in by the year's end. Salford Mayor Paul Dennett expressed enthusiasm for the project as a vital part of community renewal, while Lovell's managing director highlighted the potential for over 2,000 new and refurbished homes in the area. Local employment opportunities and apprenticeships are part of the plan, making it a positive step for the community.
