Angela Rayner, MP for Stockport, has stepped down as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after admitting she underpaid stamp duty on her second home in Hove. The 45-year-old, whoâ€™s also resigning from her role as deputy leader of the Labour Party, acknowledged that she should have sought expert tax advice, despite initially relying on legal guidance. An investigation by ethics advisor Sir Laurie Magnus revealed that she failed to meet the correct stamp duty rate, which is especially significant given her government responsibilities. Rayner expressed deep regret in her resignation letter, taking full responsibility for her oversight. She stressed that it was never her intention to evade any financial obligations. Rayner, who made history as the first woman MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, acknowledged the importance of maintaining high standards in public service.
