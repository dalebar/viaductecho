Angela Rayner has stepped down as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after admitting she underpaid stamp duty on her Â£800,000 second home in Hove. The 45-year-old, who also plans to resign as deputy leader of the Labour Party, acknowledged that she should have sought proper tax advice given her governmental role. An independent ethics investigation found she failed to pay the correct stamp duty, which raised concerns about her adherence to expected standards of conduct. Despite expressing regret and taking full responsibility for the oversight, Rayner emphasised that it was never her intention to underpay. She made history as the first woman MP for Ashton-under-Lyne after her election in 2015.
