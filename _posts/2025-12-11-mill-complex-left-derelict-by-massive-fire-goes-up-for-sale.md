Pioneer Mill in Radcliffe is up for sale following a major fire on September 27, which left part of the building in ruins and a firefighter injured. The 304,920 sq ft site is being marketed by Manchester-based WT Gunson but has no listed purchase price, inviting offers instead. The mill is currently vacant and in a derelict state after some parts were demolished for safety reasons post-fire. While it has a history as a commercial warehouse, redevelopment may be possible pending planning permission. Notably, the site is within a flood zone. 

Nearby, a £3.2 million project to restore the Milltown Street bridge is nearing completion, improving access to Radcliffe town centre. Additionally, a new development of 400 homes is underway at the former East Lancs Paper Mill site, signalling ongoing investment in the area. Following the fire, GMFRS is conducting an investigation to learn from the incident, reaffirming the hazards faced by firefighters in their critical roles.
