Bus services in Greater Manchester are set for major disruption from September 19 to 22, as over 2,000 Unite union members, including drivers from Stagecoach, Metroline Manchester, and First Bus Rochdale, will strike. They have rejected a pay offer of 3.5%, which they feel fails to address years of low pay amid a cost of living crisis. First Bus Rochdale workers also turned down a 6% offer. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, highlighted the firms' profitability while workers face inadequate wages. This co-ordinated strike is expected to lead to significant travel chaos, affecting major events like Manchester United's game and concerts by Peter Kay and Tom Grennan. Unite regional officer Colin Hayden expressed that the strike is a last resort for drivers, urging employers to return to negotiations with a better offer.
