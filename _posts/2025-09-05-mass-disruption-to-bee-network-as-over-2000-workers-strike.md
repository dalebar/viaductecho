Bus services in Greater Manchester are set for major disruptions this September due to a coordinated strike involving over 2,000 Unite members, including drivers from Stagecoach, Metroline Manchester, and First Bus Rochdale. The strike, scheduled from 19th to 22nd September, follows the rejection of a pay offer of 3.5% by drivers, who feel it fails to address ongoing low wages amid the cost of living crisis. The strike will likely cause chaos, affecting services during key events like Manchester United’s match against Chelsea, comedian Peter Kay’s show, and Tom Grennan’s concert. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, expressed frustration at profitable companies denying fair wages and stressed the members’ determination to strike for better pay. Regional officer Colin Hayden acknowledged the disappointment for local residents but emphasized that the decision to walk out reflects their need to be heard. Unite remains hopeful for renewed negotiations with improved offers from the bus companies.
