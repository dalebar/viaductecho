The festive lights trail "Alice in the Hidden Garden" at Bents in Greater Manchester has been cancelled for Tuesday night due to Storm Bram, which has caused severe weather and an amber flood alert in the region. Bents issued an apology to customers, ensuring those affected will be contacted the next day. The light trail, promising a mile-long adventure filled with dazzling lights and life-sized animations, is set to run from now until January 3, excluding a few key dates. Recent heavy rain and strong winds have prompted the Environment Agency to issue alerts for rising water levels, particularly in areas around the middle River Mersey, as well as parts of Stockport and Sale, warning of potential flooding. Residents are advised to be cautious near low-lying paths and bridges.
