Stockroom, Stockport's new library and events space, is shortlisted for the Greater Manchester Building of the Year awards. Opened in May 2025, it's one of seven standout buildings recognised for enhancing the local economy and community. Competing projects include Ancoats Mobility Hub and Oldham Old Library, with the winner set to be announced on 5 March at Manchester Hall. Diane Elebert-Morgan from the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce praised the shortlist, highlighting the region's impressive new building quality. Stockroom features an open plan with areas for socialising and study, plus a café, events space, children’s area, and both fiction and non-fiction sections spread across multiple floors. It revitalises previously disused retail units, contributing to a vibrant atmosphere in Merseyway.
