Manchester council might support the Manchester Evening News' campaign urging Mayor Andy Burnham to provide free bus passes for homeless children living in temporary accommodation more than a 30-minute walk from school. Since August, the M.E.N. has highlighted how these kids struggle to get to class due to long distances, while current government rules leave many ineligible for free travel. There are nearly 1,905 families in temporary accommodation in Manchester, with 8,000 children affected overall in Greater Manchester. 

Coun Astrid Johnson, leader of Manchester Greens, has submitted a motion to officially back the proposal, stressing the need for support amid ongoing challenges facing these families. She pointed out that ensuring free travel would help keep children in school and provide much-needed stability. The motion requires Labour’s support to pass, but opposition councillors are expected to back it. Previously, Burnham expressed sympathy for the cause, indicating potential discussions about linking support packages, with budget talks coming up in January. The council meeting to discuss this is set for 10am on January 28.
