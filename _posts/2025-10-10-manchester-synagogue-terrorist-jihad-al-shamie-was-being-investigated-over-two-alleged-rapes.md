Jihad Al-Shamie, the Manchester synagogue attacker, was under investigation for two alleged rapes at the time of his crime, according to the Manchester Evening News. Reports were made to the police in late 2024 and mid-2025. Al-Shamie, 35, had a history of minor criminal offences and had been on bail when he attacked worshippers at the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue on October 2, 2025, killing two men and injuring several others while pledging allegiance to the Islamic State during a 999 call. He was shot dead by police, with one victim, Adrian Daulby, accidentally killed in the crossfire. The Independent Office of Police Complaints (IOPC) is reviewing Greater Manchester Police's handling of Al-Shamie's previous allegations, with initial findings showing no misconduct by officers who intervened during the attack. Police Chief Sir Stephen Watson expressed gratitude for public support and commitment to safeguarding all communities in Greater Manchester. Al-Shamie, a Syrian-born UK citizen since 2006, may have been influenced by extremist ideology.
