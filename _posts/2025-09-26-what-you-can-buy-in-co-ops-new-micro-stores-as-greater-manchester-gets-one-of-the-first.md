Co-op is excited to introduce its new 'on the go' micro store concept in the bustling Stamford Quarter of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, making it one of the first in the north west. These mini stores will cater to the increasing demand for quick, high-quality meals, featuring a revamped deli selection and exclusive products. They’ll be open from 7am to 7pm for everything from breakfast to dinner, with an option for online orders after hours, including speedy delivery for popular items like Co-op’s Irresistible Pizzas through partners like Just Eat, Deliveroo, and Uber Eats. 

The store promises a fresh take on food-to-go, combining tasty options like hot lunches, breakfast pots, and deli-inspired fare—ideal for those on the move. It's a step toward revitalising the area and enhancing convenience for the community, with Co-op aiming to bring quality and value right to local shoppers' fingertips.
