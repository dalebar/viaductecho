Albert Bridge House, a historic 18-storey tower in Manchester, is set to be demolished to make way for two new skyscrapers reaching 37 and 49 storeys. Despite the excitement around the project, which includes luxurious amenities like saunas and ice baths, it will not feature any affordable housing. Local councillors expressed disappointment, particularly Liberal Democrat Coun Richard Kilpatrick, who emphasised the need for affordable properties alongside such developments. While developer Oval argues the project will boost the economy and connect the city with the river, the lack of affordable housing has left many feeling frustrated. In other planning news, a proposal for a student accommodation block on Upper Brook Street was rejected due to concerns over disamenity, while other residential projects in the area were approved.
