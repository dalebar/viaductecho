The CEO of Manchester Airport has confirmed that free drop-offs and pick-ups won't return, citing the charging policy as essential for managing traffic. A new barrierless parking system was introduced to address complaints about drivers unintentionally entering pricier pay brackets while waiting. Now, no payments are made on-site, but drivers must pay online within 24 hours to avoid fines. Fees are £5 for five minutes, £6.40 for ten, and £25 for up to 30 minutes. 

The airport's approach aligns with traffic management strategies seen at other UK airports, which helps prevent congestion and environmental impact. While acknowledging that some may find charges frustrating, Chris Woodroofe stressed that these measures ultimately improve service and safety. He highlighted a free drop-off option at JetParks1 with shuttle buses running frequently to the terminals, making it easier than people might think. Plus, the £5 drop-off fee is reportedly the cheapest among major UK airports, making it a reasonable option for those who need to drop off passengers.
