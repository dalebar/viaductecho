Susan Haworth, a former Labour councillor, has switched parties to join Reform UK, becoming Bolton's first Reform councillor. Representing the Farnworth North ward, she’s been in local politics for 12 years and has a background in public sector management and healthcare. After leaving the Labour group in August, she sat as an Independent but is now officially with Reform UK. Haworth highlighted concerns from residents about high immigration, stretched local services, and safety issues in Bolton, expressing her belief that only Reform can address these problems. A spokesperson for Reform UK welcomed Haworth, noting her as a valuable addition as they prepare for the next general election. Labour currently holds a minority administration in Bolton Council.
