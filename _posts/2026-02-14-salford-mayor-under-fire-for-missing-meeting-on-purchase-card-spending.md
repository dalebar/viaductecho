Salford’s mayor, Paul Dennett, faced backlash for skipping a council meeting about purchase cards amid scrutiny over his spending. These cards, used by senior councillors, cover expenses like travel, accommodation, and meals. Councillor Adam Kealey, chairing the audit committee, was frustrated that he wasn’t notified of Dennett’s absence until hours before the meeting, despite expectations for his attendance.

The discussion revealed concerns about transparency and how funds are allocated, with past spending exceeding £50,000 since 2016. Notable expenses included a £600 meal described as a business meeting and costs for hotels during GMCA-related trips. While some councillors questioned the appropriateness of such high expenses, Salford’s city solicitor maintained they were legitimate. 

The council acknowledged the need for clearer policies regarding purchase card usage and agreed to review councillor allowances linked to these cards. Despite criticism, a spokesperson claimed the mayor is committed to transparency, stating the committee was informed he wouldn't attend beforehand, but only the committee clerk was told.
