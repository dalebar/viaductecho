Janet Davies, a 65-year-old from Macclesfield, has been sentenced for stealing nearly £20,000 from her elderly mother. Between 2017 and 2021, she fraudulently claimed attendance allowance payments meant for her disabled mother without her knowledge, pocketing a total of £19,577.45. Davies received a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after admitting to retaining wrongful credit. Cheshire Police highlighted the breach of trust, emphasising that Davies exploited her mother's vulnerability for personal gain.
