Janet Davies, 65, has been sentenced for fraudulently stealing nearly £20,000 from her elderly mother. Between 2017 and 2021, Davies applied for attendance allowance, a benefit for elderly disabled individuals, without her mother's knowledge, and pocketed the payments amounting to £19,577.45. The court in Chester gave her a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after she admitted to retaining a wrongful credit. Det Sgt Laura Fox from Cheshire Police highlighted how Davies exploited her position of trust instead of supporting her vulnerable mother.
