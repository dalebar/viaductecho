Janet Davies, a 65-year-old from Macclesfield, has been sentenced for stealing nearly £20,000 from her elderly mother. Between 2017 and 2021, she fraudulently set up attendance allowance payments for her mother, who was unaware, and pocketed a total of £19,577.45 from the Department for Work and Pensions. At Chester Crown Court, she received a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after admitting to retaining a wrongful credit. Detectives highlighted how Davies abused her position of trust, exploiting her vulnerable mother instead of managing her finances responsibly.
