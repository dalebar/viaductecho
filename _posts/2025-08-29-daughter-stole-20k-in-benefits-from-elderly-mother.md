Janet Davies, a 65-year-old from Macclesfield, has been sentenced for stealing nearly £20,000 from her elderly mother. Between 2017 and 2021, she fraudulently set up attendance allowance payments—funds meant to support elderly disabled individuals—without her mother's knowledge, pocketing a total of £19,577.45. After admitting to her wrongdoing, Davies received a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Chester Crown Court. Cheshire Police's Det Sgt Laura Fox highlighted how Davies exploited her position of trust instead of helping her vulnerable mother.
