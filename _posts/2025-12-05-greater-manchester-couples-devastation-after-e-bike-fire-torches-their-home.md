A family from Wigan, Christine and Neil Clayton, experienced a near disaster when an e-bike battery exploded while charging overnight, leading to significant damage to their home. They heard strange noises and discovered smoke in their kitchen before calling the fire brigade. Thankfully, they managed to escape safely, but Christine's warning is clear: never charge e-bike batteries unattended, especially overnight. 

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) has launched a campaign stressing the importance of safe practices regarding e-bikes and their lithium-ion batteries. With an alarming rise in incidents linked to these batteries, GMFRS advises shoppers to buy only from trusted retailers and ensure products have proper safety markings. Additionally, batteries should never be charged in corridors or left unattended. The hope is that by following these safety tips, families can prevent devastating fires and stay safe this Christmas.
