Chloe Whelan, 36, launched a racist tirade at police officers who were helping her after a man assaulted her. While police restrained her assailant in Manchester city centre, Whelan physically attacked an officer and used appallingly abusive language, including racial slurs. During her transport to the station, she continued the verbal onslaught, spouting disrespectful and threatening remarks. Prosecutor Helen Longworth noted Whelan's intoxication and a history of racially aggravated disorder. Whelan's legal representative claimed she felt embarrassed and ashamed, revealing a reliance on alcohol stemming from personal issues but said she has since abstained and engaged in Islamic studies. The judge condemned her behaviour as “vile,” emphasizing that being drunk wasn't an excuse. Whelan received an 18-month community order, rehabilitation requirements, and a £240 fine.
