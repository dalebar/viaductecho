A children's home in Oldham, owned by Lighthouse Collaborative Care, has been rated as ‘requires improvement’ by Ofsted following two close calls where incorrect medication was nearly given to a child. Despite these incidents, praise was given for the positive relationships between staff and the one child currently living there, with the teen reportedly feeling more settled than ever. Ofsted highlighted the need for better medication practices and adherence to plans regarding the child's mobile phone use. One staff member has been suspended amid ongoing investigations. The director, Karen Holden, acknowledged the difficulties stemming from recent staff vacancies and leadership changes, stressing that securing an experienced registered manager is crucial for improvement. She emphasized the home’s commitment to the child’s wellbeing and the nurturing environment created by the staff. Overall, while there are areas that need addressing, the focus remains on providing safe and loving care for the children.
