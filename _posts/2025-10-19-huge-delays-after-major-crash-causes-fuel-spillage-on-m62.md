There are significant delays on the M62 this afternoon due to a major multi-vehicle crash near Greater Manchester, specifically close to junction 22 for Denshaw. Initially, all traffic was held, causing a considerable fuel spillage. Although National Highways has started to reopen some lanes, drivers are still facing delays of at least 45 minutes and around 3 miles of congestion. Traffic has been released into the third lane, but lanes 1 and 2 remain closed off. For continuous updates, you can follow the live blog.
