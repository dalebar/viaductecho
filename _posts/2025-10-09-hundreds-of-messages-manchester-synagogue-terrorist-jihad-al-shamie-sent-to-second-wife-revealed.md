Jihad Al-Shamie, the Manchester synagogue terrorist, had a complex and troubling relationship with a woman he married online. Despite confessing he was already married with a child, he repeatedly begged her for a second chance, expressing love and desperation in their many exchanged messages since 2021. He justified his situation by explaining that, in Islam, a man can have multiple wives, though he admitted lying about his existing family out of fear of her reaction. The woman accused him of manipulating her, alleging a controlling nature while struggling with his repeated accusations of infidelity. Their exchanges included apologies, pleas for forgiveness, and discussions about wanting a family together, but the relationship turned toxic over time. Al-Shamie, who was granted British citizenship in 2006 and was on police bail for rape, tragically carried out a violent attack at a synagogue, resulting in two deaths and several injuries. He last contacted the woman in April, but she ignored him, having already requested a divorce that he refused to grant.
