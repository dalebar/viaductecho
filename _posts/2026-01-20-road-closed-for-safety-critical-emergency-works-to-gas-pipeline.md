Grimshaw Lane in Chadderton will be closed for the rest of the month due to emergency gas pipe repairs. Cadent Gas Ltd is replacing a 50-metre section of an old gas pipeline, originally installed in 1910, after discovering its poor condition during routine maintenance. A road closure is effective at the junction with Foxdenton Lane and Broadgate, while a temporary bypass is being set up to ensure homes continue receiving gas during the work. Cadent’s engineers have emphasised the importance of this replacement to avoid ongoing disruptions. They appreciate the community's patience, noting that while access to local businesses is being maintained, motorists should expect minor delays. Residents are also advised to report any gas smells to the national emergency line, as it might not be related to the ongoing works.
