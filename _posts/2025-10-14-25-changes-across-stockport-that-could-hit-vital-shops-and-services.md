Stockport's Lib Dem-led council is set to introduce new charges at 25 free car parks before Christmas, starting from 50p to Â£2.40 for ten hours. This decision, part of the February 2024 budget, has raised concerns from opposition councillors about its impact on local communities. Labour councillor Dean Fitzpatrick highlighted issues such as potential decreased footfall in local shops and increased congestion as workers might park elsewhere to avoid fees. He mentioned that local businesses like the chemist might struggle. Coun Christine Carrigan expressed frustration over the council's management of the fee introduction, citing lack of transparency and omitted reports. However, Lib Dem councillor Grace Baynham stated that the fees are meant to standardise parking across the borough and aid council finances. She emphasised that the charges are nominal and won't negatively affect residential parking. Some businesses may even see a positive turnover in parking. The council insists that no procedural errors occurred in the decision-making process. A list of affected car parks is expected to be released soon.
