Mitchell received a three-year sentence. David O'Brien, a convicted rapist, was handed a fourth life sentence after attempting to stab a prison officer. He has a history of violent attacks in prison. Mark Nuttall was sentenced to 21 years for attempting to murder a woman with a meat cleaver, while John Ahern, a paedophile, was jailed for 19 years for abusing two boys decades ago. In drug-related cases, Ray Ostrowski received 20 months for bringing cannabis into the UK, while Casimiro De Lemos-Francisco was sentenced to over six years for smuggling cocaine in a mobility scooter.
