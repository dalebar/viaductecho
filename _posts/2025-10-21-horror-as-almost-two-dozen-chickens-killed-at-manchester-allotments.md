At Sharston Community Allotments in Manchester, a tragic incident occurred where 22 chickens were found dead, leading to a police investigation. Owner Eleen Cowgill discovered the grim scene after locking them up safely the night before. It appears someone used a key to access the locked coop, with no signs of a predator attack, suggesting a deliberate act. Eleen, who rescues chickens from factory farms for a better life, expressed her heartbreak over the loss, especially as her children enjoyed caring for them. Eleven birds remain, and the community plans to enhance security by installing cameras. The police have been informed and are looking into the case, while the allotments remain a beloved spot for locals, especially families.
