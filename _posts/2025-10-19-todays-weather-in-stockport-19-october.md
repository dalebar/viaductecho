Stockport's weather today is set for a mixed bag, with grey clouds and rain throughout the day. Temperatures will hover between 11°C and 14°C, with high humidity at 82% and gusty winds reaching 25 mph. Expect drizzle in the morning, followed by brief sunny spells, but keep an umbrella handy as showers are a certainty. 

For commuters, bear in mind that the wet weather could lead to delays, so factor in extra travel time and consider alternative routes to avoid congestion. Waterproof clothing is a must, along with securing loose items outdoors due to the brisk winds. If you're planning on being outside, layering up will help adapt to the changing temps. Overall, it's a day best spent prepared, whether you're dashing out or staying in. Stay dry!
