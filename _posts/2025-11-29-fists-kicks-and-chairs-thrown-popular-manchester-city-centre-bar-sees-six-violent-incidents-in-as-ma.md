Manahatta, a popular bar in Manchester’s city centre, has managed to keep its alcohol licence despite six violent incidents in just six months. Greater Manchester Police recommended its licence be revoked after a series of brawls, including one that left a woman with a serious head injury. At a council hearing, the bar’s representatives expressed regret, attributing the issues to insufficient door staff. They highlighted the bar’s long-standing good record before this troubling period and noted improvements made, like increasing security personnel and switching to plastic glasses. Councillors acknowledged past failures but decided to impose stricter conditions rather than revoke the licence, believing these measures would help prevent future incidents. They urged the bar to ensure safety to avoid further trouble, with a warning that future lapses could lead to more serious consequences.
