Ian Brown has paid tribute to his late bandmate Mani, describing him as "a beautiful human being" and calling for a 50ft solid gold statue in his honour. At Mani's funeral, which drew numerous rock icons, the idea sparked a community crowdfunder to create a large mural celebrating Mani’s life and raising funds for the Maggie's Centre, a charity close to him and his late wife, Imelda. 

The mural will be made in Failsworth, where Mani grew up, with support from his brother Greg and the GRIT Studios team. Renowned artist Pic.One.Art will bring the design to life, following a surge of love from fans across Greater Manchester. John Macaulay of GRIT Studios emphasised Mani's warm, generous spirit and the impact he had on the community. The project aims not just to honour Mani’s music but also to celebrate his kindness, while providing support for the Maggie’s Centre. The ‘Mural for Mani’ crowdfunder is now live, and donations of any size are encouraged.
