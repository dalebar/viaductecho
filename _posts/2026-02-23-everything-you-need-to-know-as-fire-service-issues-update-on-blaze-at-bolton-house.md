A fire in a terraced house on Hilden Street, Bolton, was likely caused by an electrical fault, according to the fire service. It started around 10.45am on Sunday, prompting a response from firefighters, police, and paramedics. One person suffered smoke inhalation and minor burns and was taken to hospital. Crews worked for about three hours to control the flames, which originated in the living room. The property was left with blackened walls, a missing front window, and significant internal damage. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service confirmed the fire's electrical cause in a recent update.
