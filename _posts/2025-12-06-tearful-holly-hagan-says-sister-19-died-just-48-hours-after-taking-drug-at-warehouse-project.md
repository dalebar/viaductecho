Holly Hagan, a former Geordie Shore star, has shared the heartbreaking story of her 19-year-old sister, Darci Rose Gibson, who died after taking crystal MDMA at the Warehouse Project in Manchester. Darci suffered two cardiac arrests hours after mixing the drug into her drink and sadly passed away two days later in hospital. Holly, who detailed the traumatic experience to the Daily Mail, expressed her regrets about not checking on her sister’s drug use before the night out. She emphasised that Darci had been sensible and had only experimented with drugs at events in the past. Following this tragedy, Holly aims to raise awareness around the risks of recreational drug use, stressing that even minor misjudgements can have devastating consequences. She also expressed the importance of empathy towards those who make similar choices, pointing out that many in the club that night likely faced the same risks. Holly is now determined to share her sister’s story to help protect others, stating that drug-related tragedies can happen to anyone. Holly's experience has made her wary of drugs entirely, even painkillers, as she reflects on the unforeseen dangers.
