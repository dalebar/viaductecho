The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the police response to a tragic attack on a synagogue in north Manchester on October 2. The incident involved a vehicle being driven at members of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, followed by the driver, Jihad al-Shamie, attacking worshippers with a knife before being shot by armed police. Sadly, two people lost their lives, and four others were injured, with some injuries reportedly due to police gunfire as officers intervened to protect the community. Reports suggest that the deceased may have suffered gunshot wounds inadvertently during the struggle to stop the attacker. The IOPC aims to clarify the events surrounding the incident and ensure an independent oversight of the investigation. Their director expressed condolences to the victims and their families and confirmed that they are gathering evidence and overseeing the post-mortems while allowing the police to continue their essential work. Further updates will be shared as the investigation progresses.
