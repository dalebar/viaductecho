Bricktastic, the UK's largest Lego event, is making a comeback in Manchester on 22 and 23 February after last year's sell-out success. Taking place at Manchester Central, the convention will showcase over 250 displays, ranging from cars and robots to amazing structures. Tickets are required for entry, and the venue will be fully accessible, providing a limited number of self-propelled wheelchairs. Don't forget to catch the latest from BBC Radio Manchester and follow them on social media for updates!
