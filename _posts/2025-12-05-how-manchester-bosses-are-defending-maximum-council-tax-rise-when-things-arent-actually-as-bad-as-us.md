Manchester council is set to raise council tax by the maximum allowed, 4.99%, despite receiving a £94m boost from the government. This increase is seen as necessary by Councilor Rabnawaz Akbar to maintain essential income. The council's revenue budget relies heavily on council tax, which constitutes 28% of its funding. While officials acknowledge the added government funding will help address pressures in social care and support community initiatives, they argue that failing to raise taxes now would mean permanent loss of future income. Under the new plan, a typical Band D property’s yearly bill will rise from £2,183.03 to £2,291.96, but many residents in lower-banded homes will see smaller increases. The council is also committed to alleviating the cost-of-living crisis with £60m in support programs.
