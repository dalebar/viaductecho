Lines through Hazel Grove are back open after being closed this afternoon when a person was reported on the wrong side of a bridge. Emergency services, including police, paramedics, and fire crews, responded promptly, arriving shortly after 12.30pm. The individual was safely brought down just after 2pm, and thankfully, there were no injuries. However, Network Rail has warned that rail disruptions may continue until 5pm. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service noted that two fire engines were deployed from Stockport and Offerton stations and that firefighters collaborated with the police to resolve the situation, remaining on-site for about an hour and a half.
