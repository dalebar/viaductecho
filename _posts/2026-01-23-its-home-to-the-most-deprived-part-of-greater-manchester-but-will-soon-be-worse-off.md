Stockport and Trafford councils have missed out on important government funding again this year, despite Stockport housing the most deprived area in Greater Manchester. Both councils were not allocated any of the Recovery Grant, which aims to support areas with dire financial needs. Last year, they missed out as well, with £600m distributed to councils nationwide. Councillor Jilly Julian from Stockport expressed that the council has been ‘left behind’ and is now facing a funding shortfall of £63m by 2029, worsened by an additional £12m lack in the latest budget. MP Lisa Smart highlighted that Stockport narrowly missed the grant by just 0.01%. Trafford Council's leader, Coun Tom Ross, echoed the disappointment, stating they are one of three metropolitan boroughs not qualifying for support, prompting Trafford to seek a £20m loan from the government. The Ministry of Housing acknowledged concerns but stated that both councils will see a funding increase this year while emphasising plans to improve how councils are funded in the future.
