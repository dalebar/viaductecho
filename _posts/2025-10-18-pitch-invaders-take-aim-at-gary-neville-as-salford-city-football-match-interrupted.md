During a Salford City match on October 18, pitch invaders waving England flags interrupted the game to protest against Gary Neville. The individuals, linked to the far-right group Britain First, wore hoodies stating 'Gary Neville is a traitor' after his recent comments about a British flag he removed from one of his developments, claiming it was being used negatively. Neville, a former England player and current Salford City owner, defended his actions, expressing love for his country but arguing against the frame of nationalism that the flag seemed to represent lately. The protest occurred as the match against Oldham Athletic was on, with the men storming the pitch and briefly halting the game. Some fans cheered them on, while others mocked Neville. The situation was quickly resolved as stewards removed the invaders, allowing the match to continue.
