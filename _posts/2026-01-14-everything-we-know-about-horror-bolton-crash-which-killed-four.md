A tragic head-on collision on Wigan Road, Bolton, early Sunday morning (January 12) resulted in the deaths of four people: 18-year-olds Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar and Farhan Patel, 19-year-old Mohammed Danyaal, and 54-year-old Masrob Ali. Five others were injured, including a 29-year-old woman in the taxi who faces potentially life-threatening injuries. Greater Manchester Police are investigating, having gathered CCTV footage of the crash, which shows the red Seat Leon and Citroën taxi colliding at high speeds—reportedly around 120-122mph. Detective Inspector Andrew Page indicated they are still determining the circumstances of the incident. Humayra, Masrob Ali's daughter, praised her father and the taxi driver, calling him "the gentlest soul." Witnesses and anyone with relevant dashcam footage have been urged to contact the police.
