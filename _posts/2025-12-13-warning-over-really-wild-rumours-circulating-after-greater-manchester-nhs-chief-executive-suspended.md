Mark Fisher, the chief exec of Greater Manchester’s health service, has been suspended amid an internal investigation, as confirmed by Sir Richard Leese, chair of NHS Greater Manchester. Leese addressed a public meeting, urging people to avoid speculation, emphasising the importance of respecting those involved. Fisher's suspension comes as a precaution while the investigation unfolds, with deputy chief exec Colin Scales stepping in temporarily. Fisher has had a notable career, including senior roles in the government and the civil service, and is set to retire in March after 42 years. NHS Greater Manchester stated that no assumptions should be made about the situation and added that confidentiality prevents further comments at this time.
