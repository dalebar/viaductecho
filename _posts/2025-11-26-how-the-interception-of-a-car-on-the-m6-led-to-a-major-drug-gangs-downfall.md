Three men have been jailed for their roles in a cannabis trafficking network across Greater Manchester and Lancashire. Hafiz Razaq, Deepak Singh, and Jordan Riddick were linked to a gang based in Bolton, with Razaq identified as the main operator. Over the course of an investigation from May 2023 to July 2024, police seized about 30kg of cannabis, three handguns, and ammunition. Razaq was seen loading bin bags filled with cannabis into his car and coordinating deliveries with Singh, who was found with firearms at his home. Riddick received cannabis through this network. Razaq received a total of nine years in prison, Singh was sentenced to six years and four months, and Riddick was given three years and nine months. The hearings took place at Preston Crown Court.
