Samantha Wall, a 55-year-old from Cheadle Hulme, has been sentenced to 28 months in prison for stalking, harassment, and malicious communications after a four-year campaign of abusive behaviour towards two victims. She made false accusations via social media, claiming one victim was a psychopath and had harassed her for years, even alleging he had tried to harm her cat and was serving a prison sentenceâ€”none of which were true. Her harassment began in 2019 after a brief encounter at an event, escalating with constant online abuse. Wall pleaded guilty to five charges at Manchester Crown Court and has been given a restraining order. The case, highlighted by PC Wayne Hasselby from Greater Manchester Police, underlines the serious psychological impact of online stalking. Victims are encouraged to report any harassment they face, showcasing the commitment to tackling such crimes.
