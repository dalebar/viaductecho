A mosque in Stockport, the Islamic Centre, has embraced a message of unity amidst the appearance of St George's flags around Higher Hillgate, part of a national campaign called 'operation raise the colours'. Caretaker Ghulam Abbas, who's lived in the UK for over 50 years, expressed his pride in displaying the flag as a symbol of community togetherness. He noted that while division exists, the flag represents a pathway to unity. The wave of patriotism has also seen flags popping up across Greater Manchester, with many locals viewing them positively. Ejiro Chukwadi, a recent immigrant from Nigeria, echoed this sentiment, appreciating the beauty of national pride. The flags remain largely unhindered unless they pose safety risks, showcasing community spirit in the area.
