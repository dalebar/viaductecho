Salford's deputy mayor, Jack Youd, is embroiled in controversy after allegations of a cover-up surrounding his personal relationship with a council employee. Despite being married to an elected councillor, Youd admitted to the relationship and expressed regret over the situation. Calls for an independent review have arisen after an anonymous misconduct complaint was emailed, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the integrity of council decision-making. Alarmingly, the complaint was reportedly deleted shortly after it arrived, prompting accusations of a cover-up to protect Youd and the council's reputation. Mayor Paul Dennett defended the handling of the matter, asserting no evidence of misconduct had been found, while critics argue it undermines transparency and accountability. This scandal could have significant implications for Salford's political future, as Youd was seen as a potential successor to Dennett, whose ambitions to move to Greater Manchester mayor may now be affected. Members from opposing parties are demanding accountability and thorough investigations into the council's processes regarding the mishandling of the complaint.
