Greater Manchester's in for a milder week after a chilly spell with temps dipping below freezing last week. Today, we're looking at a high of 5°C, which warms up to about 7°C by Thursday and possibly reaching 9°C over the weekend. Most of today should stay dry, but expect some rain after 7pm. For the rest of the week, it seems quite dry with just a few light showers here and there. The Met Office mentioned a frosty morning, followed by a bright start but a cloudier afternoon with less sunshine. Thursday may kick off with fog, but looks to bring more sun before it turns cloudier again. The weekend’s shaping up to be a bit dreary with mist and fog hanging about, but periods of brightness could pop through. So, while it’s warming up, don't tuck that brolly away just yet!
