The Gorton and Denton by-election is heating up, just ten days away and already full of drama. Reform UK reported Labour to the police for a dodgy video targeting their candidate, while Labour poked fun at the Greens for spelling errors on their campaign posters. Meanwhile, Angela Rayner took a jab at Reform, saying they can’t even find the constituency on a map. The tension escalated when Reform’s Matt Goodwin challenged Green Party’s Hannah Spencer to a debate, claiming the election is now a ‘two-horse race’. Spencer hit back, noting they had already debated recently and that she’d rather spend her time connecting with constituents instead of playing debate games. With 11 candidates in the running, including Labour's Angeliki Stogia and Conservative Charlotte Anne Cadden, the polls open on February 26. It’s promising to be a lively contest for everyone involved!
