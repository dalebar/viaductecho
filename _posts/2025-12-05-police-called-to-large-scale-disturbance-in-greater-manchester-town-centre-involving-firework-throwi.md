Police in Oldham dealt with a significant disturbance involving about 100 youths on Union Street, where fighting and fireworks were reported. This prompted Greater Manchester Police to establish a dispersal order and a weekend patrol plan to prevent further trouble. Inspector Kat Murray expressed concern for residents and highlighted the importance of addressing anti-social behaviour (ASB). Officers will be actively engaging with the community and encouraging reports of ASB. This initiative ties into a broader Home Office campaign, Operation North Star, which focuses on tackling key crime types like domestic abuse and drug offences. GMP is currently running a winter crime crackdown to ensure public safety.
