Rachel O'Hare, a well-known interior designer from Manchester, tragically fell to her death last summer. Before her passing, she wrote a devastating note to her family, expressing struggles with her ex-partner Owen Pacey, who she claimed had taken everything from her during a difficult legal dispute over finances. Rachel’s mother testified that the ongoing legal battles were overwhelming for her daughter. Rachel’s poignant message reflected her feelings of self-loathing and hopelessness, stating she felt “like a washed-up nearly 50-year-old.” Despite being a loving mother and active in charity work, particularly helping vulnerable women, she felt embarrassed and alone. The inquest confirmed that Rachel had a history of mental health issues and had sought help just weeks before her death. Police ruled her death a suicide, with no suspicious circumstances involved. The coroner acknowledged the emotional pain Rachel was enduring and highlighted her legacy of support for others in need.
