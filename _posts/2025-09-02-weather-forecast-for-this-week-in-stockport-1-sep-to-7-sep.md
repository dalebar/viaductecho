Stockport's weather this week is shaping up to be mostly cloudy, with some rain on and off. It kicks off with Monday seeing temperatures between 14°C and 19°C, with a hefty chance of rain and brisk winds. Tuesday is a bit milder, touching 20°C, but rain chances still linger at 61%. Midweek—Wednesday—will have a similar vibe, with high humidity and possible rain. 

Things lighten up by Friday, with less cloud and a fair shot at a dry day, before Saturday brings the warmest temp at 22°C, but it's still overcast. Sunday continues the cloudy trend, with cooler temps around 15°C to 18°C and more drizzle expected. 

Compared to last week, it’s definitely a shift to cooler, wetter weather, especially early on. If you're heading out, best pack an umbrella for Monday and Wednesday, but Friday looks good for commuting. As for the weekend, Saturday’s your best bet for outdoor fun before Sunday’s chill sets in.
