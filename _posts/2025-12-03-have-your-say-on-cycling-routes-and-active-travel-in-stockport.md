Stockport Council is gathering local opinions on new cycling and walking routes in the Town Centre West area until 7 December. Residents can weigh in on a proposed network linking Stockport Interchange, the railway station, Edgeley, and Stockport College. The consultation focuses on several key plans, including the Edgeley Active Travel Corridor, which aims to connect the Trans-Pennine Trail, separate walking and cycling paths, and Toucan crossings. Other projects include improving access through Hollywood Park, enhancing the Adswood and Stockholm Road junction, and better connecting to Alexandra Park. The council is keen to hear your thoughts on these ambitious proposals to create a cohesive walking and cycling network. Interested locals can respond to the survey linked in the notice. Cheers for getting involved!
