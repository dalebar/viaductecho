Lucy Powell, Labourâ€™s new deputy leader from Manchester, has urged her party to distance itself from Nigel Farage's politics in her victory speech after winning by 54% to 46% against Bridget Phillipson. Having represented Manchester Central since 2012, Powell previously served as Commons leader until her dismissal last month, allowing her to critique the Government more freely. In her speech, she emphasised that Labour shouldn't try to out-Reform Reform but should focus on creating a broad progressive consensus. She strongly rejected Farage's immigration rhetoric, arguing that the root issue lies in the economic benefits being skewed towards a few. With turnout at just 16.6%, Powell wants Labour to offer real hope and clarity about its values amidst recent governmental chaos. She insists on the need for bold changes to meet the public's demands.
