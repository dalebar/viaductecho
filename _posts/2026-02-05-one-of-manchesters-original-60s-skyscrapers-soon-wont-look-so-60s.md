Manchester One, a historic 21-storey skyscraper from the 1960s, is set for a £17 million makeover that includes a four-storey extension. Originally known as St Andrew’s House when it opened in 1962, it's now home to various businesses like Gaydio and the Polish consulate. Bruntwood SciTech aims to rejuvenate the building while keeping it integral to Manchester's skyline. Matthew Morten from Bruntwood SciTech emphasised the focus on sustainability, wellness, and creating an inviting workplace to attract talent. The plans feature a new green-clad reception area with a cafe for the public, alongside a full facade revitalisation and expanded floor plans, adding an extra 30,000 sq ft of space. The planning application was submitted recently, with construction anticipated to start this summer, aiming for completion by early 2028.
