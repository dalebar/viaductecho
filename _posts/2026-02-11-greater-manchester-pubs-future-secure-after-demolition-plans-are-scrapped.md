The Pegs Langtern pub in Ashton has narrowly escaped demolition after community pushback and increased local support prompted McCabe Ltd to scrap their plans for redevelopment into housing. After briefly closing last November, the pub reopened in December under new management, following a significant renovation by Stacked Burgers & Desserts. Once in a sorry state, the pub now boasts modern facilities, a revamped bar area, and hosts various events like quiz nights and sports on TV. The owner, Wes Hague, and manager Corey Whittaker, both passionate about the pub’s potential, are keen to make it a community hub. They've received glowing feedback for their burger offerings and are encouraging locals to come by and support the revitalised Pegs.
