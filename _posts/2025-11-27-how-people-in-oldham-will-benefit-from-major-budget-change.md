Around 10,000 kids in Oldham are set to gain from the lifting of the two-child benefit cap, a move hailed by the council to tackle serious child poverty. It’s estimated that half of the borough’s 30,000 children live in deprivation, with areas like Coldhurst having two-thirds of kids from struggling families. The cap, which restricted parents from claiming benefits for more than two children, has been linked to rising child poverty levels, prompting calls for change from MPs and charities. Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced this policy shift, which is expected to lift over 6,000 children in Oldham West, Chadderton, and Royton, and around 4,900 in Oldham East and Saddleworth out of poverty. Council leader Arooj Shah emphasised the positive impact on families facing a tough cost of living crisis, while MP Debbie Abrahams highlighted the need for a broader strategy to tackle child poverty comprehensively. The call for a more inclusive approach indicates that while this change is welcome, more action is needed to fully support families and prevent further poverty.
