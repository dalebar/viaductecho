A car fire blocked a major road in south Manchester this morning around 8:25 am, specifically on the A5103 near Princess Road and the M60 slip. Thankfully, no injuries were reported as no one was inside the vehicle when it ignited. Firefighters from Wythenshawe quickly attended to the blaze, with thick black smoke seen from the car engulfed in flames. The incident has caused heavy traffic, with one lane closed, but updates indicate that traffic is now easing. Emergency crews, including Greater Manchester Police, remained on the scene to manage the situation.
