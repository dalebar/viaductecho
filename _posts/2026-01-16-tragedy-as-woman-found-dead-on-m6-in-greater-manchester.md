The M6 is shut down after a woman was found dead on the motorway near Wigan this morning, January 16, at around 7:42am. Greater Manchester Police reported no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death, and formal identification is pending. The road closures are active between junctions 23 (East Lancs Road) and 26 (M58 Orrell Interchange), with Downall Green Road also closed due to the incident. Expect significant delays, with 45 minutes of congestion reported northbound and 20 minutes southbound. A diversion is in place, and it's unclear when the road will reopen, likely remaining closed throughout the day. GMP urges drivers to reconsider travel plans while investigations take place. For anyone needing support, Samaritans are available 24/7 at 116 123.
