Masrob Ali emigrated from Bangladesh to the UK at 12 and devoted himself to creating a good life for his family. He built a home in Blackburn near his mosque and was a DIY enthusiast, handling home renovations himself. At 25, he returned to Bangladesh, married Husna, and they started a family, eventually welcoming four children. Tragically, on January 11, Masrob was killed in a car crash while driving his taxi in Bolton, colliding with another vehicle. Both drivers died, and his two passengers suffered serious injuries. The family received the heartbreaking news just hours later, leaving his wife and children in shock and disbelief. As they await funeral arrangements, currently delayed by an ongoing police investigation, the family is touched by the support from their wider Muslim community. Humayra, his eldest daughter, reflects on her father’s kindness and hard work, struggling to comprehend their loss. The outpouring of love highlights Masrob's role as a gentle and dedicated family man.
