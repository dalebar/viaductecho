Virgin Media services have faced a major outage across Manchester and various parts of the UK, with thousands of customers reporting issues on DownDetector on the evening of December 11. The trouble began around 9pm, affecting WiFi and TV services, as indicated in emails sent to some users. Areas like Oldham, Ancoats, Crumpsall, Blackley, and Salford experienced significant disruptions. One frustrated customer in Salford had to drive a couple of miles to connect to 5G for urgent messages. By 11pm, over 10,000 reports had been logged, particularly from major cities like Manchester, London, and Birmingham. As of now, Virgin Media has yet to release a statement about the ongoing issue.
