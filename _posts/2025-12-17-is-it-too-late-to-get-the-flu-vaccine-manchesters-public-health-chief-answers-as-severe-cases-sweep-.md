Flu cases are on the rise across the UK, with serious admissions increasing in Greater Manchester, doubling since early December. Health experts warn that this year's H3N2 strain is spreading swiftly, particularly among children aged five to 14, leading to more severe illnesses and hospitalisations. Dr Cordelle Ofori, Manchester's Director of Public Health, emphasised the importance of getting vaccinated, noting it's not too late to do so. The vaccine starts working immediately and becomes most effective after two weeks, which is crucial as Christmas approaches. 

While the uptake of the vaccine is encouraging among vulnerable groups, everyone eligible—especially those over 65 or with long-term conditions—should get vaccinated. Good hygiene practices are also vital to curb the spread, including handwashing and proper respiratory etiquette. Numerous vaccination clinics are available across Greater Manchester, including walk-in options. People can book through their GP or local pharmacies for free vaccines, while those not eligible can opt for private vaccinations at pharmacies.
