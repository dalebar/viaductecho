Jack Chadwick, while walking home in Manchester, stumbled upon an injured pigeon he named Belinda. He took her home, concerned for her wellbeing, and after some frantic calls, discovered Manchester Pigeon Rehab, a volunteer network dedicated to caring for injured pigeons. Chadwick expressed pride in this community effort, noting the urgency and dedication seen in Manchester, which he believes is unique. The group offers various services, including foot care for pigeons and transport to rehab centres. Their work has gained popularity, boosting their online presence significantly. Emily Hanley, one of the rehabbers caring for Belinda, highlighted the friendships formed within the group. Chadwick later reflected on his experience in the Guardian, appreciating the new perspective on his city that Belinda had shown him.
