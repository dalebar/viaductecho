A massive illegal rubbish dump in Wigan, containing about 25,000 tons of waste, has been revealed to partially sit on land owned by the King. Located on Bolton House Road in Bickershaw, the site has become a growing concern for local residents, as it has been filled with lorries dumping everything from household rubbish to harmful chemicals since January 2025. The Duchy of Lancaster, which owns around 30% of the site, claims it’s not responsible for the cleanup due to an ancient feudal legal framework, placing the burden on Wigan Council. Local residents express frustrations over the lack of intervention from authorities, exacerbated by a fire declared a major incident at the site. While the Duchy says it’s open to discussions, the council is wary, knowing the cleanup costs may exceed the land's value. The Environment Agency is limited in its response without the Duchy’s involvement and has begun a criminal investigation into the situation. Residents are understandably upset over the health hazards posed by the rubbish dump and the lack of action until now.
