The Prime Minister's office has denied telling Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham not to run for the Gorton and Denton by-election after Labour blocked his bid for the seat. Burnham expressed his intent to contest the vacant position one day, only for the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC) to stop him the next, citing concerns about resource allocation for upcoming elections. ITV's political editor suggested Burnham was aware of the likely rejection before applying, interpreting his move as an attempt to challenge Labour leader Keir Starmer. Burnham refuted this claim, insisting he received no indication of a block and asserting the NEC's independence. Following the controversy, Number 10 reiterated their lack of involvement in Burnham’s application process. Burnham expressed disappointment over the NEC's decision but plans to focus on his current mayoral role. Meanwhile, Labour is considering several councillors as candidates for the by-election, while Matt Goodwin has been announced as the candidate for Reform UK.
