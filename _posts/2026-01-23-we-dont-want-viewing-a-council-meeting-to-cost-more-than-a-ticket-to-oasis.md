Bury councillors have turned down a proposal to livestream more town hall meetings, suggesting some would be pricier than an Oasis ticket. Radcliffe First, an independent group, pushed for more transparency through live video of planning and scrutiny sessions, stating it could help rebuild trust in local governance. Currently, only full council and cabinet meetings are streamed, while many Greater Manchester councils offer more extensive coverage. Councillor Carol Birchmore expressed frustration at negative perceptions of councillors, highlighting the need for better understanding of their work. A public attendee pointed out that accessibility is an issue for those with disabilities or caring responsibilities. After a cost analysis showed low viewership for many meetings, Council leader Eammon O’Brien defended limiting streams, stating only the most viewed should remain live. The vote against extended livestreaming was not unanimous, as O’Brien mentioned a new protocol where meetings could be requested for broadcast based on public interest, aiming for a reasonable balance between cost and community engagement.
