Two blokes have been sentenced after attacking Mohmand Ahmadyar-Khan, a concierge in Cheadle Hulme, fracturing his skull. The incident unfolded when he confronted three men rummaging through bins for balloons and asked them to leave. Things turned nasty, and one threatened him while another, Joshua Maddocks, hurled a gas canister at him. After the assault, Mr Ahmadyar-Khan was left bloodied and dazed, later requiring hospital treatment and surgeries that prevented him from returning to work. 

Maddocks, 20, was sentenced to two years for inflicting serious bodily harm, while Kole Barratt, 21, received a 12-month suspended sentence for similar charges and other offences, plus 180 hours of community service. The third attacker is still at large.
