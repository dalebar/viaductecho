Stockport’s town centre is thriving thanks to a £1bn regeneration, attracting shoppers from across Greater Manchester. Anticipated Metrolink services and new housing developments will further boost this growth. However, there are concerns about the council’s plan to increase parking fees to address a £20m budget gap. Current parking costs of £1.10 for an hour may rise to £1.50, causing anxiety among local businesses and shoppers who fear it could deter visitors. Business owners, like Steve Barry of Love Bling Accessories, stress that this move threatens the town's revitalisation efforts. While some support the increase as necessary for council funds, many residents feel it’s unfair, especially given recent enhancements in the area. Stockport Council faces tough financial challenges, including cuts and limited government aid, prompting these controversial proposals. A vote on the budget, including parking fees, is set for February 26.
