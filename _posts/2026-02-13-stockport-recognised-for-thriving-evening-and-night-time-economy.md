Councillor Micheala Meikle and Rhys Owen from Stockport BID both celebrated this achievement, attributing it to the collaborative efforts of local businesses and stakeholders in creating a lively and safe environment. Inspector Jason Holmwood from Greater Manchester Police highlighted the effective partnership between the police, council, and businesses in maintaining these high standards. Overall, this accolade reflects Stockport's commitment to enhancing its night-time experience and ensuring it remains welcoming for visitors.
