A derelict building in Stockport Underbanks is set for regeneration after being acquired by Emperor Property Holdings. Opposite Robinson's Brewery, the building has faced years of neglect, but Emperor is determined to restore it, describing the project as one of their toughest yet. Crews are now on-site, although the final vision for the building remains under wraps. Emperor sees potential where others see challenges and views this investment as a chance to revive a forgotten structure while contributing to Stockport's growth. They're eager to tackle the risks that come with such a challenging project.
