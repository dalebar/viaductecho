Andy Burnham had a moment of surprise when shown an £18,000 bronze sculpture of his head live on radio. The bust, created by Morecambe sculptor Anthony D Padgett, will be unveiled at the Manchester Art Fair this weekend. It took Padgett 40 hours to craft and was inspired by Burnham's 2022 speech on Universal Basic Income. Burnham commented on the likeness, noting he appeared "intense and serious" like during an interview on BBC Breakfast. Padgett aims to elevate the profile of political figures from the North, highlighting a regional imbalance in representation in art. The sculpture reflects Burnham's advocacy for Manchester and the North, which Padgett believes deserves recognition alongside London. The Manchester Art Fair, happening from November 21 to 23, will also showcase works from other local artists.
