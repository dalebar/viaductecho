Jordan Winstanley, a 30-year-old drug dealer from Bury, was sentenced to eight years in prison after boasting he’d never be caught by police. He faced four counts of conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis. Alongside him, 47-year-old Carl Allan received two years and three months for one count of conspiracy. The pair were sentenced at Manchester Crown Square Court on September 23. Their operation involved using street couriers to distribute drugs in Bury. The investigation began in August 2022, with mobile phone data linking Winstanley to a drugs line. Despite being arrested and previously bailed for a trial in 2025, he was caught again in March 2024 with a new drugs line and remanded in custody. Both men pleaded guilty in February 2025. Detective Constable Prince of GMP’s Bury Challenger group emphasised that this case highlights their persistent efforts against drug-related crime in Greater Manchester and urged the community to report any suspicious activity.
