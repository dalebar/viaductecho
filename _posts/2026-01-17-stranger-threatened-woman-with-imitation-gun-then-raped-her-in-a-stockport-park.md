A 28-year-old man, Usama Al-Sari, was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to multiple serious charges, including rape and sexual assault, which occurred in Heaton Mersey Park, Stockport. On September 9 last year, he approached a woman at gunpoint, demanding her phone before forcing her into a sexual act. The victim, who remains anonymous, suffered severe psychological impacts from the attack, including flashbacks and social isolation. Al-Sari, who claimed to have had "urges" to harm women and sought help for his intrusive thoughts, was deemed a high risk to females. The court revealed troubling details about Al-Sari’s troubled past and his attempts to manage his urges through inappropriate means. He was sentenced as a dangerous offender with an extended licence and received a lifelong restraining order; he’s also required to stay on the Sex Offender's Register for life. The judge highlighted that his prior attempts to cope had only exacerbated his issues.
