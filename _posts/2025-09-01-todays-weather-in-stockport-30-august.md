Saturday in Stockport is shaping up to be a wet one, with a mix of clouds and rain throughout the day. Temperatures will hover between 18°C and 12°C, and with high humidity at 82%, it might feel a bit muggy. Rain is all but guaranteed, with a 100% chance of precipitation, so don’t forget your waterproofs! Expect brisk winds from the south-west, reaching speeds of up to 27 mph, which will make it feel cooler.

If you’re commuting, be sure to give yourself extra time as roads may be slippery, and visibility could be poor. Check those windscreen wipers are working well too! In terms of what to wear, layers are key, and waterproof shoes and an umbrella are a must. Given the likelihood of rain, planning indoor activities might be a good shout to make the most of your day, despite the dreary weather. Stay dry and take care out there!
