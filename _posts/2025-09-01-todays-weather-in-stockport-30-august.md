Saturday’s weather in Stockport is set to be a bit of a mixed bag. Expect a blend of clouds and rain throughout the day, with temperatures ranging from 18°C at the peak to 12°C later on. The humidity will be quite high at 82%, making it feel a touch warmer. With a whopping 100% chance of rain, it’s definitely a day for your waterproofs!  

Winds could whip up to 27 mph from the south-west, adding a chill to the dampness. So, while the thermometer might say it’s mild, don't get caught out – it’ll feel cooler outside, especially with the rain.  

For those commuting, it’s best to allow extra time as roads may be slick and visibility reduced. Make sure your windscreen wipers are in tip-top shape too! 

If you’re heading out, dress in layers and have your umbrella and waterproof shoes at the ready. Maybe stick to indoor plans since rain is likely to stick around, ensuring your day can still be enjoyable despite the gloomy forecast!
