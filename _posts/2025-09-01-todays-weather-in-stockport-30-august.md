Stockport's weather on Saturday is looking pretty mixed, with clouds and rain dominating the day. Expect temperatures between 12°C and 18°C, but with high humidity at 82%, it might feel muggy. There's a 100% chance of rain, so better grab your waterproofs – you're definitely going to need them! A brisk wind from the south-west at up to 27 mph will make it feel cooler, especially when combined with the rain. 

If you're heading out, be cautious on the roads; expect delays due to wet conditions and reduced visibility. Make sure your windscreen wipers are working well and stick to lower speed limits to stay safe. To stay comfy throughout the day, layer up and keep those waterproof shoes handy. It might be best to plan some indoor activities since rain is pretty much a given. Stay dry and make the most of the day despite the dreary forecast!
