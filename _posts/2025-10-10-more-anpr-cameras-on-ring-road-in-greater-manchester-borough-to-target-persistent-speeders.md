Bolton's council is rolling out new roadside cameras to tackle persistent speeding after a previous trial saw an 80% drop in offences. Six cameras will be installed along the A58 ring road, extending the successful Vision Zero project which aims to eliminate road deaths and serious injuries by 2040 across Greater Manchester. The cameras, provided by Tektrans, will monitor vehicle speeds and gather number plate data for a year. Theyâ€™ll help identify repeat offenders, with police engaging directly to discuss safe driving habits. If speeding continues, vehicle registrations will be flagged for more scrutiny. Referring to the project's success, Councillor Hamid Khurram emphasised the council's commitment to road safety and urged drivers to stick to speed limits for everyone's safety.
