Blue badge holders have special guidance for picking up and dropping off at Manchester Airport. For drop-offs, they can enter the drop-off zone free of charge, but must show their Blue Badge to traffic marshals. There's also a help point in JetParks 1 for those needing assistance or dropping off without a Blue Badge. 

The pick-up process differs by terminal:  
- **Terminal 1:** Use the short stay car park.  
- **Terminal 2:** Go to the express pick-up zone, with a 15-minute limit. For longer stays, use the short stay area on levels one to three.  
- **Terminal 3:** Pick-ups happen in designated bays in the multi-storey car park, and charges apply.  

Parking charges for T2 and T3 vary:  
- Up to 15 mins: £6.40  
- Up to 30 mins: £8.30  
- Up to 45 mins: £9.80  
- Up to 1 hour: £12.80  
- Up to 2 hours: £21.20  
- Up to 4 hours: £31.80  
- Up to 24 hours: £61.40
