Bolton Council is proposing a new licensing scheme for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), with a fee of £1,200 per property, as part of efforts to control and improve shared housing in the area. This initiative follows an ‘Article 4 direction’ enforced last June, requiring planning permission for all HMO conversions. The aim is to enhance safety, property standards, and management, while protecting tenants and boosting local neighbourhoods. 

The proposed scheme would extend licensing to smaller HMOs (three or four occupants), which currently fall outside national regulations, addressing concerns around poor management and safety. The consultation invites feedback from various stakeholders until April 19, seeking input on the scheme's implementation and fee structure. Councillor Sean Fielding emphasised the council's commitment to tackling the growth of poorly managed HMOs, highlighting the ongoing housing market challenges in Bolton. Residents, landlords, and businesses can share their views through an online survey or by attending consultation events.
