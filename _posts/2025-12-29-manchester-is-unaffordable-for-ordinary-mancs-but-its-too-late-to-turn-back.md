Sean McGlynn and locals reflect on Manchester's skyline transformation and socio-economic changes. While economic growth of 3.1% over the past decade stands out, many residents feel disconnected from the boom, with increased homelessness and child poverty despite luxury developments. Elaine Douglas from Moss Side acknowledges positive changes but hasn't felt direct benefits, and Yvette Sulley voices frustration over rising costs. Mayor Andy Burnham’s £1bn Good Growth Fund aims to address disparities, focusing on underdeveloped areas.

Critics like Charlie Winstanley argue that the shift towards a service economy and gentrification benefitted newcomers over long-standing residents. He highlights the failure to build enough affordable housing, which fuels the ongoing housing crisis. Despite some social progress, including reduced educational inequity, stark issues like growing poverty prevail. Winstanley suggests that Manchester’s growth model has significantly failed its existing population, with little sign of reversing the emerging affordability crisis as city leaders seemingly stick to this flawed approach.
