Christmas can be tough for some, but the spirit of generosity shines through, especially in Stockport with The Giving Tree scheme. Started by Victoria Nichol in 2018, this initiative aims to ensure every child has a present to unwrap on Christmas Day. Tags indicating a child's age, gender, and their Christmas wish are placed on trees around Stockport. Community members can grab a tag, buy the requested gift, and drop it off at a collection point. Last year, the scheme saw over 7,000 gifts donated, plus winter essentials for those in need. This year's run continues until Sunday 14 December at the white Christmas tree in the Merseyway Centre. Join in and make someone’s Christmas a bit brighter!
