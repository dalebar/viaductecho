The Manchester Evening News has identified the two innocent worshippers affected in the Crumpsall synagogue incident. Adrian Daulby, 53, tragically died, while Yoni Finlay sustained a non-life-threatening injury. Both were behind the synagogue door, trying to prevent attacker Jihad Al-Shamie from entering when they were caught in police cross-fire. Daulbyâ€™s death follows the attack that also claimed Melvin Cravitz, 66, outside the synagogue. Finlay, a father of three, reportedly suffered a stomach injury possibly from a stray bullet or debris. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed both men were shot by police as they acted to protect the community. The assailant, Al-Shamie, was neutralised on site and was found to be unarmed. GMP Chief Constable Stephen Watson stated the gunshots resulted from officers' efforts to stop the attack, calling it a tragic incident. He extended condolences to the families and community affected, while specialist officers are providing support to those impacted. Further arrests have been made in connection with the attack.
