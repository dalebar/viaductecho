A 31-year-old man was arrested in Wythenshawe on January 13, following a series of burglaries across Greater Manchester, including areas like Stockport, Trafford, and south Manchester. The burglaries, linked to a stolen black moped from Didsbury, occurred over the past three weeks. Officers connected him to 16 offences, ranging from burglary to vehicle theft, and he was also wanted for absconding from prison. PC Hannah Woodall highlighted the police's proactive efforts to tackle these crimes, noting a 21% reduction in burglaries across Greater Manchester over the past year. The suspect remains in custody for questioning.
