Plans are in motion for a new 'garden neighbourhood' in Stockport, targeting green belt land south of Chester Road in Woodford. Spearheaded by JAG Woodford Ltd and Russell Homes, the proposal includes up to 395 homes, with around half marked as affordable. The vision also features 15 self-build plots, 72 extra care apartments, a care home, a shop or café, a medical centre, a nature park, and a day nursery.

While the land is within the Greater Manchester green belt, the developers argue it should be reclassified as 'grey belt' due to its low-performance characteristics. They claim the impact on the green belt would be minimal. The proposal aims to create a diverse housing offering, including homes for young people, families, and the elderly, supported by new access roads and potential bus services. Harrow Estates is also expanding the nearby Woodford Garden Village, which has already seen over 600 homes built since 2015. Planning applications can be viewed on the Public Notices Portal.
