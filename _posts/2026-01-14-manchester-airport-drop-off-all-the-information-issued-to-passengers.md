If you're heading to or from Manchester Airport, it's key to know the drop-off info for each terminal since it varies. From November 19, 2025, all flights from Terminal 1 will shift to Terminals 2 and 3 due to a £1.3bn airport upgrade. Here's the lowdown on drop-off charges: 

- **Terminal 1, 2, and 3**: 
  - 5 minutes: £5.00 
  - 10 minutes: £6.40 
  - Up to 30 minutes: £25.00 
  - Maximum stay is 30 minutes. 
  - A £100 penalty applies for pick-ups in drop-off zones. 

For longer visits, consider the 'turn up and park' options. 

**Directions**:
- **Terminal 1**: From M56 Junction 5, follow signs; look for the Hilton and Clayton Hotels, then take the left ramp to the drop-off car park. (Postcode: M90 3EX)
  
- **Terminal 2**: Same exit from M56; follow signs to upper forecourt next to check-in. (Postcode: M90 5PH)
