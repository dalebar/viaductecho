Bristol Airport has bumped up its drop-off fee to £8.50, making it one of England's priciest. Public transport isn’t always a feasible option, especially for airports beyond London. While Bristol has various parking choices and public transport links, London Gatwick is set to take the crown as the priciest on Tuesday with a £3 hike. London City Airport is also introducing its first drop-off charge, but blue badge holders will be exempt. Meanwhile, Newcastle Airport got rid of its free drop-off last December.
