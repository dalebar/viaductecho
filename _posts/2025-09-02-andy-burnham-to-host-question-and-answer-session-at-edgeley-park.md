Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is hosting 'Mayor's Question Time' at Edgeley Park on Thursday, 18 September, at 7.30pm. It's free to attend and a chance for you to ask the mayor questions. If you're going, you can submit one question when you register, which will be chosen by an independent journalist to ensure a good mix of topics. There’ll also be time for additional questions from the audience. It's best to register in advance, but you can show up on the day if there’s space. These events happen every three months in different spots around Greater Manchester, so it's a great way to voice what matters to you. For more details and registration, check the event link.
