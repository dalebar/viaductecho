A black and white cat was sadly found abandoned in a rucksack in a river in Greater Manchester, just before Christmas. Discovered in Reddish Vale Park, the cat was severely hypothermic and later passed away on December 23. The RSPCA is seeking information to identify the individual who dumped the cat, calling it a cruel act at a time meant for family gatherings. This incident is part of a concerning trend, with animal abandonment rates hitting a six-year high, with over 24,000 cases reported to the RSPCA this year. Christmas saw a spike in animal welfare calls, with 241 on Christmas Day alone. Francesca Iraci from the RSPCA encourages anyone struggling with pet care during these tough economic times to reach out for help rather than abandoning their pets. The RSPCA has resources available, including a cost of living hub and over 200 Pet Food Bank Partnerships. They urge anyone with information about the dumped cat to contact them at 0300 123 8018, citing incident number 01702394.
