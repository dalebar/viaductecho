Saturday in Stockport is looking a bit gloomy, with plenty of rain and brisk winds expected. Temperatures will hit a high of 10°C, dropping to around 5°C, so definitely dress for the chill. The day kicks off with some clouds and slight sunshine, but it won’t take long for the skies to turn overcast, with a guaranteed 100% chance of rain. Expect everything from light drizzles to heavier showers, so carrying an umbrella is a must.

Winds will be quite lively at up to 22 mph, giving that extra chill in the air. If you're commuting, allow for some extra travel time as roads may be slippery and public transport could face delays. On the bright side, Saturday’s rain creates a perfect excuse to enjoy some indoor fun—think local museums, cafés, or catching up on home projects. If you do head out, make sure to wear your waterproofs and sturdy shoes to stay warm and dry.
