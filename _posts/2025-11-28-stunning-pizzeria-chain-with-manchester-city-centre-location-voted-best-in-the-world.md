L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele in Manchester has been crowned the best artisanal pizza chain in the world, topping the 50 Top World Artisan Pizza Chains list. Founded in Naples about 150 years ago, it now boasts over 70 locations globally, including a fab spot on King Street in Manchester. The ranking was revealed at the European Pizza Show in London and presented by Spanish journalist Verónica Zumalacárregui. Other Manchester pizzerias making the list include Pizza Pilgrims, established by the Ellio brothers, and the Paris-based Big Mamma group, which opened Circolo Popolare this summer. Rudy's also made an appearance, coming in at 23rd. Following Da Michele, Big Mamma took second place, with Grosso Napoletano and Bráz rounding out the top slots. The award curators expressed pride in the growing artisanal pizza movement, blending quality craftsmanship with solid business practices. His Excellency Inigo Lambertini, Italy's Ambassador to the UK, noted that pizza embodies cultural heritage and community spirit, making it a perfect fit for London, a global crossroads of cuisine.
