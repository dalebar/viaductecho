The M61 motorway is closed in both directions tonight due to a police incident near Bolton, affecting traffic between Junction 2 and Junction 4. The closure was first reported around 8.30pm, and diversions are in place. National Highways Traffic Officers are on the scene assisting with traffic management. 

For northbound drivers, guidance is to exit the M61 at Junction 2 and follow a specific diversion route via local roads back to the motorway. Southbound traffic is advised to follow a separate diversion route. 

Traffic updates indicate that the motorway remains shut, with slow traffic reported. It's suggested to plan your journey accordingly and leave extra time if you're travelling in that area. Further updates will be provided as the situation evolves.
