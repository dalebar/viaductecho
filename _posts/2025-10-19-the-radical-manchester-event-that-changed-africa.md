In October 1945, a significant Pan-African Congress took place just outside Manchester, bringing together global delegates to discuss unity against racial injustice and colonialism. This was the first congress after a hiatus due to the world wars, marking a pivotal moment in African politics that still has an impact today. Key figures like Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah, who later emerged as leaders of their countries, collaborated on strategies for independence. The congress raised crucial demands for ending colonial rule and promoting racial equity for Africans globally. Experts highlight that this event was unique, as it attracted a broader spectrum of activists rather than just the elite. Following this congress, future gatherings continued the movementâ€™s momentum into the late 1970s. Celebrating its 80th anniversary, Manchester will host events to honour this rich history, reinforcing the city as a crucial hub for global liberation movements.
