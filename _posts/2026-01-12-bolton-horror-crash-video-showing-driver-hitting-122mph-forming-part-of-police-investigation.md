A police investigation is underway concerning a fatal head-on crash in Bolton on January 11, involving high-speed reckless driving. Video footage shows a driver reaching speeds over 120mph while weaving through traffic shortly before the collision. Tragically, three teenagers in the Seat Leon and the taxi driver, 54-year-old Masrob Ali, lost their lives in the crash on Wigan Road. The passengers in the Citroen taxi suffered various injuries, with one woman in critical condition. The deceased have been identified as Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, Farhan Patel, and Mohammed Danyaal, all aged 18 to 19. Mr Ali's family expressed their grief, calling him a kind and safe driver.
