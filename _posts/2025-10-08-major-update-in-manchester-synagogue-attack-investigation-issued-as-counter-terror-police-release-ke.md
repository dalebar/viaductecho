A recent attack in Crumpsall, Manchester, saw Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, armed with two knives, deliberately drive his car into pedestrians outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue. After striking, he attempted to forcibly enter the building. Al-Shamie made a 999 call during the attack, claiming responsibility and pledging allegiance to Islamic State. He was shot dead by armed police, who responded to the incident. Tragically, two victims, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, lost their lives, while several others were injured, including a security guard and a CST worker. Six individuals were arrested in connection with the attack, but many were subsequently released without charges. Authorities confirmed that Al-Shamie was not previously known to Counter Terrorism Police or the PREVENT programme despite concerning behaviour noted before the attack. Investigations are ongoing, and Assistant Chief Constable Robert Potts emphasised the complexity of the case, while also expressing gratitude for community support as they piece together this shocking event.
