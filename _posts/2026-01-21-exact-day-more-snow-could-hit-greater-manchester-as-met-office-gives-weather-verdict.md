Greater Manchester and other parts of the UK are expecting a drop in temperatures next week, with the Met Office warning of potential snow showers starting Tuesday, January 27. Following a milder spell, temperatures will begin to fall from Sunday, starting at a pleasant 10°C but dropping to about 5°C. The forecast from January 25 to February 3 indicates a mix of rain and snow, especially across hills in Scotland and northern England, as weather systems from the Atlantic clash with high pressure over the UK. Earlier this month, Storm Goretti caused significant disruption with strong winds and heavy weather, leading to school closures and unfortunate incidents, like a fatal accident in Cornwall. So, brace yourselves for some wintry conditions on the horizon!
