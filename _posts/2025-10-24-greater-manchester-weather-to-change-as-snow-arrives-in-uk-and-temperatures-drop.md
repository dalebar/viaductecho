As the clocks turn back, Greater Manchester’s weather is heading into winter mode, with temperatures dipping to around 3C this weekend. While parts of the UK might see snowflakes, we’re set for a chillier vibe without the white stuff. Expect showers on Friday, especially in Wigan and Bolton, but things should clear up later, bringing some sunshine with highs around 11C. Saturday looks nice with a sunny morning and afternoon, though it will feel colder, especially in places like Oldham and Ramsbottom. The mercury could even drop to -1C overnight. Sunday starts bright but clouds will roll in, with light rain expected later that turns heavier by evening. Highs again reach around 11C, but it’ll stay milder overnight with temperatures around 7C to 8C.
