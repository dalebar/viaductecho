Defence minister Luke Pollard visited the KNDS facility in Stockport this month, highlighting the area's role in national defence and advanced manufacturing. Accompanied by local MP Navendu Mishra, Pollard toured the Heaton Chapel site, meeting staff and apprentices. He praised the facility for providing skilled jobs and contributing to national security, stating, "Defence investment supports both our national security and well-paid jobs across the UK." Mishra echoed this sentiment, commending KNDS for continuing Stockport's industrial legacy with top-notch manufacturing. This visit follows a previous one by John Healey MP in February 2022.
