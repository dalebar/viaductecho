Christopher Ridgway from Stockport has been fined over £1,500 for illegally dumping rubbish he was paid to remove. Advertising as “Stockport Waste Removal” on social media, he operated without the proper waste carrier’s licence and disposed of commercial waste at local recycling centres instead of responsibly handling it. Residents reportedly paid him hundreds of pounds, believing he would dispose of their waste properly. His downfall was linked to an investigation that uncovered his branding at a fly-tipping site. The magistrates considered a jail sentence but opted for financial penalties, taking into account his role as a full-time carer. Cllr Dan Oliver stressed that illegal waste disposal won’t be tolerated and advised residents to check for valid waste carrier licences and receipts before hiring anyone to remove waste. The successful prosecution was a result of collaboration between Stockport Council and SUEZ recycling and recovery UK, which provided evidence of Ridgway's unlawful activities. His total penalty includes a £480 fine, a victim surcharge, and cleanup costs, amounting to £1,504.70.
