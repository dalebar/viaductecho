It's been over a year since plans for the Star Lakeside Academy in Littleborough were put on hold, originally proposed back in 2019. While a similar school in Bowlee opened in 2021, Littleborough's project has faced delays due to cost and access issues. The Department for Education is expected to provide an update in Spring 2025 but has been silent so far. The review by the DfE led to Rochdale Council being told the project was ‘unpaused’ in November 2023, yet confusion remains after the general election. The demand for secondary school places in Littleborough is on the rise, with 584 Year 6 pupils this May but only 510 available places, leading to families seeking schooling outside the area. Current projections suggest a shortage of secondary places in both the Pennines and Rochdale by 2027. MP Paul Waugh has reached out to the Minister for School Standards, highlighting that the situation has become "unmanageable," leaving children to face lengthy commutes and separation from family. The need for action on the new school is urgent.
