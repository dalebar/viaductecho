Andy Burnham passionately defended his bid to become the Gorton and Denton MP during an 11-minute interview on BBC Radio Manchester. His attempt was quickly blocked by Labour's ruling body, leaving him to refocus on his role as mayor. He expressed that his family has been affected by the political turmoil and emphasised the importance of consolidating what he has built in Greater Manchester. Burnham discredited claims that his candidacy was a move to challenge Keir Starmer's leadership and clarified that he sought assurance from key party members before entering the race, aiming to contribute positively to the government. He engaged in a fair discussion with the Prime Minister but felt misrepresented by media briefings regarding his bid. Burnham vowed to give his full attention to his mayoral duties moving forward, while acknowledging the personal impact the situation has had on his family, highlighting the importance of family discussions in decision-making.
