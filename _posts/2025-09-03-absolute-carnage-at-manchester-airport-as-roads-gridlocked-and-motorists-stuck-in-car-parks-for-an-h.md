Manchester Airport saw 'absolute carnage' on September 3, with motorists stuck for up to an hour in gridlocked traffic. Photos on social media depicted long queues, particularly around Terminal 1 and Terminal 3, coinciding with a busy holiday period as families seek affordable trips post-school holidays. Incidents of chaos were noted as drivers complained about honking horns and delays exacerbated by a barrier fault at the short stay express pick-up area. The airport responded by deploying traffic marshals, clearing congestion within an hour, and acknowledged the issues while apologising for the inconvenience. New charging changes for drop-offs have also raised concerns among drivers. Overall, the day was marked by significant traffic disruptions that frustrated both passengers and motorists.
