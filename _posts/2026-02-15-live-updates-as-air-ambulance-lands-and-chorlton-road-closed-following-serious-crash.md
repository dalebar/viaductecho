Barlow Moor Road in Chorlton has been closed off by police following a collision on February 14. Emergency services, including an air ambulance, responded to the scene, though the air ambulance has since departed. Witnesses report that traffic is being turned around as the road remains shut in both directions from Maitland Avenue to Derwent Avenue. Police have established a small cordon and are directing vehicles, ensuring a “relaxed” atmosphere despite the incident. The damaged vehicle and bike are still at the site as authorities work on clearing the area. Updates will be provided as more information comes in.
