Salford's own billionaires, Fred and Peter Done, have made a splash by topping the UK's tax league with a staggering £400.1 million contribution to HMRC, as revealed in The Sunday Times Tax List 2026. This year, the list highlighted 100 wealthy individuals and families, collectively paying £5.758 billion in taxes—up from last year's £4.985 billion. New entries include Harry Styles, Erling Haaland, and Mohamed Salah, while other familiar names like JK Rowling and Ed Sheeran also made the cut. The list reflects a diverse mix of taxpayers, from football stars to successful entrepreneurs. Robert Watts, who compiles the list, noted the significant increase in tax contributions, largely due to higher corporation tax rates. Interestingly, some taxpayers have moved abroad, potentially avoiding UK taxes. Meanwhile, Fred Done has raised concerns about potential tax hikes on gambling, warning that it could threaten 7,500 jobs across their Betfred shops.
