A serious incident occurred outside a synagogue in north Manchester on October 2, where an attacker drove a car into the building and stabbed people. Armed police shot the suspect, who is believed to have died, after spotting ‘suspicious items’ strapped to him. Tragically, two people were killed and three others are in a serious condition. The incident is being regarded as a potential terror attack, leading to a major incident declaration and the implementation of PLATO, the UK's response protocol for terrorist attacks.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is hosting an emergency meeting and has assured that additional police will be deployed to synagogues across the country for safety. Police have commended the public's quick actions that prevented the suspect from entering the synagogue, and they are currently in contact with local places of worship to provide reassurance. They're also asking anyone with images or footage of the incident to share them directly with police rather than posting online. The community is in shock, especially given the attack coincided with a significant day for the Jewish community.
