Oldham Athletic player Kane Drummond has been in hot water for not complying with his court-ordered appointments after a violent incident on a night out. The 25-year-old was handed a suspended 20-month sentence for attacking Shayan Lawrence outside a Liverpool takeaway in December 2022. Despite his second chance to turn things around, Drummond has missed all his required unpaid work sessions and supervision appointments. His defence argued that being a professional footballer and having a baby on the way contributed to his noncompliance, but the judge made it clear that his football commitments won't excuse his flouting the court order. Drummond has been given until April 15 to prove he can meet the requirements, or he risks facing prison time. Following the court’s ruling, he left the building quite quickly, hiding under his jacket.
