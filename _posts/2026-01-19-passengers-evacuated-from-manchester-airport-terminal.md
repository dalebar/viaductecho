This morning at Manchester Airport, Terminal 1 had to be evacuated due to reports of a gas smell. Fire crews responded quickly, and after an assessment, they confirmed there was no gas present. Passengers were out for about 25 minutes, but thankfully, the situation didn’t cause any significant delays. The terminal has since reopened, so all’s well that ends well!
