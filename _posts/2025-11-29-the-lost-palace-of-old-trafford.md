White City in Old Trafford is a legendary spot with a rich history, famously known for its white gates and botanical gardens, but it once had a grand neighbour: Henshaw’s Asylum for the Blind. Completed in 1837, the impressive Tudor-style building housed an asylum for the blind and a school for the deaf. Thomas Henshaw, a wealthy hatter, funded the project but tragically drowned before his will could be executed, leading to a lengthy court battle. The building, initially a rural haven, witnessed Manchester's industrial expansion and evolved into Henshaw’s Society for the Blind. After over a century, it was demolished in 1972 due to financial issues and replaced with a modern office block that itself was demolished in 2013. Memories of the asylum linger in local lore, with former students recalling its beauty and the talents of its pupils. Today, plans are underway to transform the area into a major residential site. All that’s left of Henshaw's legacy are fond memories and historical echoes in Manchester’s ever-changing landscape.
