A tragic incident has led to the closure of Bury New Road in Prestwich after a woman was killed in a crash. The road is closed between Butterstile Lane and Scholes Lane, with a significant police presence, including a cordon and a blue forensic tent on the scene. Emergency services, including ambulances and advanced paramedics, were spotted providing aid earlier. 

The driver involved has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is currently in custody as investigations continue. Traffic in surrounding areas is disrupted due to the closure. Updates from Greater Manchester Police are pending, and the road is expected to remain shut throughout the night as serious collision officers conduct their enquiries.
