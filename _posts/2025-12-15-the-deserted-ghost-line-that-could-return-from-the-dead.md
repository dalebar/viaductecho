After 33 years without regular passenger service, Denton and Reddish South train stations might soon see tram-trains on their line. Currently, the railway is underused, with only a couple of weekly 'ghost trains' and mainly freight traffic. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) has a plan to introduce tram-trains that would connect Manchester to Stockport, along with links to Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Airport, opening up access for many residents. Local group, Friends of Reddish South Station, has been advocating for improved services for two decades and supports the tram-train project, stressing the urgency to prevent the line from being shut down. Andrew Gwynne, MP for Gorton and Denton, detailed how the service could connect to Manchester Piccadilly, enhancing overall transport for the area. While this vision is still in the concept phase, progress is being made. TfGM is preparing a business case for extending the Metrolink to Stockport, which could eventually encompass tram-trains through Denton. Mayor Andy Burnham emphasised the importance of this plan for local growth and connectivity.
