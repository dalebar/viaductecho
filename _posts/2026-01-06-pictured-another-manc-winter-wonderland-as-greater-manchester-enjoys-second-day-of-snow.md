Greater Manchester's got its winter coat on with fresh snow covering many areas, as seen from Sunday night into Monday. Today, January 6, flurries have been spotted again, adding to the winter wonderland vibe. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for ice across North West England, effective from midnight until 10 am tomorrow. 

Despite the chilly weather, locals are making the most of it! Tandle Hills Park in Royton has become a hotspot for fun in the snow, with people snowboarding, sledging, and walking their dogs. Photographers have captured plenty of joyful scenes—families enjoying the snow together, cheerful pets, and walkers taking in the snowy landscape. It’s brilliant to see everyone embracing the wintry weather!
