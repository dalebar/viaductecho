The Post Office is set to open a new permanent branch in Oldham town centre on October 9 at 1pm, following the closure of the WHSmith-operated service in May. Thanks to the efforts of locals, MPs, and the council, a temporary service has been running since June at the Spindles shopping centre. A new postmaster, who currently oversees the Bury branch, will manage the Oldham location. Operating hours will be Monday to Saturday, 8.30am to 6pm, and Sunday, 10am to 5pm, offering a solid 64 hours of service weekly. The branch will also provide extra services such as driving licence renewals, vehicle tax renewals, foreign currency, and travel insurance. Council leader Arooj Shah hailed this as a significant boost for the town centre, highlighting the ongoing regeneration efforts. Oldham MP Jim McMahon championed the locals' voices in making this happen, reaffirming the Post Office's crucial role in the community. Overall, itâ€™s fantastic news for Oldham residents.
