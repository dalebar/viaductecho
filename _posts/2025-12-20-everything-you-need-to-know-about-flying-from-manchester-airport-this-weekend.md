Yesterday was a massive day for air travel in the UK, with nearly half a million passengers flying out. With winter weather likely causing last-minute changes, it’s wise to keep an eye on flight statuses. Manchester Airport is gearing up for its busiest Christmas ever, expecting about 1.5 million passengers between December 19 and January 4, peaking over 100,000 on some days. The UK Civil Aviation Authority advises travellers to pack smartly to speed through security, especially with Christmas goodies—keep those presents unwrapped! If flights get delayed or cancelled, airlines are required to provide support like food, accommodation, and refunds, so know your rights. For updated info on delayed or cancelled flights at Manchester Airport, check for more details.
