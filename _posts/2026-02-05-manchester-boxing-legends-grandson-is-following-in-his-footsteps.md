Dale Arrowsmith, a 31-year-old professional boxer, is running the Manchester Marathon to raise funds for Roy Richardson's Academy in Stockport, a boxing gym named after his late grandad, a boxing legend. The gym, which depends on volunteers and has members aged 11 to 40, needs new equipment as costs have shot up. Dale shared that they operate purely out of love for the kids, with minimal funding from session fees and fundraising efforts. Inspired by his grandad, who ran the marathon for the gym in the 80s, Dale feels it’s fitting to honour this legacy. Roy, who passed away in 2021, had a rich boxing history, beginning in carnival booths in the 1950s, before training young fighters both in New Zealand and back in the UK. Since Roy's death, Dale has stepped up to manage the gym. You can check out his fundraiser online.
