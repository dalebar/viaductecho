A woman raised concerns on social media after spotting a family with twin toddlers eating whole grapes at Wythenshawe Park, citing the choking risk they pose. She advised that grapes should be cut into quarters to reduce this risk. While some commenters supported her warning and highlighted the dangers, others criticized her for publicly shaming the parents instead of addressing them directly. The debate sparked mixed reactions, with some arguing that children have always eaten various foods without incident, while others stressed the specific danger grapes present. The NHS also recommends cutting foods like grapes to prevent choking in young children. The incident highlights the delicate balance between raising awareness and maintaining a respectful dialogue around parenting choices.
