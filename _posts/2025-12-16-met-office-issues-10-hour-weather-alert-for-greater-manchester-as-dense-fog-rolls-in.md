The Met Office has issued a 'dense fog' warning for Greater Manchester starting at midnight, lasting until 10am Wednesday. They’ve cautioned that thick fog could disrupt travel, causing delays for buses, trains, and possibly flights. The fog will spread from the west to the east overnight, with slow clearance in some areas. This warning affects other parts of the North West and various regions across England and Wales. Additionally, rain warnings are on the way for south Wales and southern England on Thursday, following heavy downpours earlier in the week. Flood alerts have also been issued for several local rivers. On a lighter note, the Manchester Evening News is here to keep you updated on local happenings, so don’t miss out!
