A fundraiser for the victims of a tragic crash in Bolton has raised £45,000 in just three days. Set up on January 11, it aims to support four taxi passengers currently in hospital with severe injuries following the accident on Wigan Road. Among them are Tom and Georgina Daniels, who spoke tearfully about their ordeal, expressing disbelief that they survived the crash that claimed four lives. They have undergone multiple surgeries and now face a daunting recovery, navigating their changing lives hour by hour. The fundraiser, established by friends Jake Regan and Lucie Wilson, seeks to cover care costs not covered by insurance and alleviate some family pressures. As the investigation into the crash continues, the focus remains on the survivors and their path to healing. Donations can still be made to reach their £55,000 target.
