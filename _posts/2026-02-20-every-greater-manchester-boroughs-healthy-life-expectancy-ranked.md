Recent stats from the Office for National Statistics reveal that Rochdale has the lowest healthy life expectancy in Greater Manchester. Males in Rochdale can expect just 54.2 years of good health, while females fare slightly better at 58. Trafford, on the other hand, tops the list, with healthy life expectancies of 65.2 years for females and 63.8 for males. Other top boroughs include Stockport, Bury, Salford, and Manchester. Unfortunately, the figures indicate a downward trend nationally, with UK women experiencing a drop of nearly three years in healthy life expectancy over the past decade, while men have seen slightly less decline. For those born between 2022 and 2024, girls are projected to enjoy about 60.9 years of good health, down from 63.4 years, and boys around 60.7 years, down from 62.4 years. These figures are the lowest since records began in 2011-13, highlighting ongoing health concerns across the region.
