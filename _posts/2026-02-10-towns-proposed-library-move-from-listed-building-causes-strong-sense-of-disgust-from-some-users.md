Plans to move Farnworth library to a new site in Farnworth Green have sparked a lively debate in the town. A consultation revealed that 56% of locals disagree with the relocation, mainly due to a strong attachment to the historic Grade II listed Carnegie building on Market Street, which they feel is an important part of the town's heritage. The new site would offer larger space (383 sqm vs. 373 sqm), but many value the old building’s legacy as "a cornerstone of Farnworth." While some think the new spot could better serve the community by being closer to amenities, worries have been raised about safety and anti-social behaviour in the area. The consultation, which ran from August to September last year, gathered 300 responses, mostly from local residents. Many frequent users of the library highlighted it as a vital resource for reading and community activities. Concerns about the future of the current building and its potential restoration were frequently mentioned. Overall, there’s a strong sentiment for preserving Farnworth's library heritage while recognising the need for updated facilities.
