Stockport's weather today is a bit of a mixed bag! Expect partly cloudy skies with a 100% chance of rain, so best pack an umbrella. Temperatures will hover between a mild 11°C and a pleasant 20°C, but high humidity (around 83%) might make it feel muggier. There's also a brisk wind at 22 mph, which could mean a chill during the cooler moments.

Commuters should be ready for some wet roads and possible disruptions, so waterproof gear is a must. Motorists need to drive cautiously as the rain and wind might affect visibility. 

For the day ahead, keep your plans flexible—outdoor activities might be interrupted by showers, so have some indoor options lined up. And don’t forget to protect your electronics and important documents from the wet weather. Enjoy the warmth when it pops up, but stay adaptable!
