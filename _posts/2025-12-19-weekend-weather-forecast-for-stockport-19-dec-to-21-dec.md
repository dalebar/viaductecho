This weekend in Stockport is looking mostly cloudy with cool temperatures between 8 to 9 degrees Celsius. Friday's got partly cloudy skies and a brisk wind, feeling cooler with a 7% chance of rain. Saturday continues the partly cloudy trend but brings a slight increase in the chance of light showers at 36%. 

Sunday’s where it gets interesting, featuring significant cloud cover and a 65% chance of rain, so it could be worth keeping the brolly handy. Temperatures will drop to around 4 degrees overnight, with high humidity at 91%.

If you're out and about, Friday and Saturday are good for outdoor plans like park visits, while Sunday might call for indoor activities like hitting up a museum or a cosy day with friends and family. Stay safe while commuting, especially with the wind and rain potentially affecting travel. Enjoy your weekend!
