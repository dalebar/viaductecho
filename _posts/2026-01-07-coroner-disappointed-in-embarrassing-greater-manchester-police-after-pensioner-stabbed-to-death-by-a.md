The coroner expressed disappointment with Greater Manchester Police's handling of a case involving the death of pensioner Roger Leadbeater, who was killed by Emma Borowy, a woman who had repeatedly gone missing from a mental health unit. Nearly two-and-a-half years since Mr Leadbeater's death, the coroner noted that vital handover processes for vulnerable individuals still aren’t in place, risking further tragedies. The officer involved acknowledged that this delay was 'embarrassing', confirming that the handover procedures remain inconsistent and are left to individual officer judgement. Despite discussions around developing a standardised form for information sharing among police and healthcare providers, implementation has stalled, raising concerns for the coroner about the safety of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the inquest revealed troubling details about Borowy's mental health history, including previous violent incidents and her repeated absences from care. Expert input highlighted questionable decision-making in granting her leave prior to the stabbing. The coroner will reconvene the inquest in January to deliver her conclusions on the case.
