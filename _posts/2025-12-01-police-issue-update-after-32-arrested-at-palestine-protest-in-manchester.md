Police in Manchester reported that all 32 individuals arrested during a pro-Palestine protest in St Peter's Square have been bailed. The arrests occurred on November 29, primarily for holding signs supporting Palestine Action, a group recently designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK Government. Greater Manchester Police confirmed the arrests were made under the Terrorism Act 2000 as they managed the protest to minimise disruption to the community. After the event, officers were seen escorting individuals away amid chants from the crowd. The investigation is currently being conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing North West.
