Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, tragically lost their lives in a terror attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall during Yom Kippur on October 2. Both were part of the north Manchester Jewish community, who had gathered for the holy day when the incident occurred. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shami, was shot dead by police, while three others suffered serious injuries. Cravitz, a local lad who once worked in a greengrocer's on Leicester Road, is remembered by those who knew him. Greater Manchester Police have informed the families of both victims and are providing support through Family Liaison Officers during this difficult time. They've also reassured that they will respect the families' cultural preferences throughout the investigation. Meanwhile, three individuals have been arrested in connection with the attack on suspicion of planning acts of terrorism.
