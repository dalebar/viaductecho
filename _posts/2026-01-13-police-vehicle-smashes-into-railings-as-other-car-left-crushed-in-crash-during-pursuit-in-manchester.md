On Monday evening, January 12, a police car in Manchester collided with another vehicle during a pursuit on Oldham Road, near Miles Platting. The crash, which happened shortly after 6pm, left both cars heavily damaged, with one vehicle losing its front bumper. Following the incident, multiple emergency services, including paramedics and fire crews, rushed to the scene. Oldham Road was cordoned off as they attended to the situation. Thankfully, those involved only suffered minor injuries. The Greater Manchester Police confirmed they received reports of the road traffic collision around 6.05pm and that emergency responders quickly worked to secure the area. Firefighters from several local stations were on site for about 45 minutes. The road has since reopened.
