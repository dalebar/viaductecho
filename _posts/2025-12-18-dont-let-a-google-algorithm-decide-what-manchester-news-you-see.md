Growing up with the Manchester Evening News (MEN) means having a local voice that tells our city's stories with heart. For 157 years, the MEN has reported on everything from wars to celebrations, always prioritising the community. However, the way people access news has changed, with algorithms sometimes burying local reporting. A recent attack on a Manchester synagogue showed that while MEN had a full team reporting live, it got pushed down Google search results, overshadowed by generic sources. To help combat this, Google now lets readers pick their preferred news sources. By making MEN your choice, you ensure that local journalism shines through when it matters most. It’s simple: just search for a news topic on Google, select MEN, and you'll see more of their stories. You can even add multiple trusted sources if you fancy. This little change can significantly enhance your news feed while keeping you connected to what happens in Manchester. If you run into any issues, MEN's team is ready to help. Choose local, stay informed!
