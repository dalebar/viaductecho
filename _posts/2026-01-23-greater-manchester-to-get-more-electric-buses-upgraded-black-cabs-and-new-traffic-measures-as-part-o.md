Greater Manchester and Stockport are set to enhance their clean air strategy with more electric buses, upgraded black cabs, and new traffic measures aimed at cutting emissions and improving traffic flow. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) reports significant progress, with plans for a fully electric bus fleet by the end of the decade. Government funding of £5.1m has already supported 98 new vehicles, with more on the way for key routes this spring. Funding will also be used for depot electrification and new chargers. Additionally, an £8m package is available to help black cab drivers upgrade to cleaner vehicles, with £1.58m already committed in grants. Traffic interventions are in place to tackle nitrogen dioxide levels, and public support for Automatic Number Plate Registration cameras was high. While clean air zone plans were scrapped, TfGM is optimistic about meeting legal nitrogen dioxide limits without a charging zone, aiming to improve public health and air quality effectively. Cllr Eamonn O'Brien highlighted the commitment to cleaner air without added financial burdens on the community.
