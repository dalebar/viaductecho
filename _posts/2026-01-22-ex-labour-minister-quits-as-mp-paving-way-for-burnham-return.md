Former Labour minister Andrew Gwynne is stepping down as an MP, opening the door for Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to possibly run in a by-election for the Gorton and Denton seat. Gwynne, who was elected as a Labour MP, faced suspension from the party in 2025 due to offensive WhatsApp messages. Regarding the speculation, Sir Keir Starmer mentioned that it's early days and the Labour Party’s National Executive Committee will outline the usual process for by-elections. Burnham, a former cabinet minister and past Labour leadership contender, hasn't dismissed the idea of challenging Starmer in the future.
