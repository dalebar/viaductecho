Tributes are pouring in for Pierre Alexandre, the celebrated celebrity hairdresser from Manchester, who passed away at 86. Born Peter Johann Franz Wasler in Switzerland, he redefined hairdressing by creating the unisex salon concept, opening his first salon in Manchester in 1965, where he attracted a star-studded clientele. Pierre's influence reached far and wide, styling iconic figures like Rod Stewart and David Bowie and teaching thousands of aspiring hairdressers. Known for his original styles and charisma, he founded the Pierre Alexandre School of Hairdressing, shaping future generations in the industry.

His family shared that Pierre lived a vibrant life, passionate about mentoring others and spreading creativity. As he moved to Spain later in life, he continued to innovate and inspire. The family expressed gratitude for the outpouring of love and memories shared since his passing, reflecting on Pierre's legacy of helping others succeed. Rather than a formal funeral, he wanted a celebration of life, encouraging friends to gather, share stories, and enjoy music that resonated with his spirit.
