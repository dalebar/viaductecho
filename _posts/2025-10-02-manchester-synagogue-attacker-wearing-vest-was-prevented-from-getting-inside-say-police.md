A suspect was shot dead after a terror attack outside a synagogue in north Manchester. The attacker attempted to enter the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation while wearing a vest resembling an explosive device, but was blocked by security and worshippers. Tragically, two members of the Jewish community lost their lives, and four others are in hospital with serious injuries. Greater Manchester Police confirmed it as a terrorist incident, with investigations led by Counterterrorism Police. Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson highlighted the bravery of those who responded quickly, preventing further harm. He mentioned that two other individuals have been arrested in connection with the attack. The police are actively working to ensure public safety and have called for community support as they investigate. The incident has deeply affected Manchesterâ€™s communities, particularly during Yom Kippur, a sacred time for Jewish worship. Authorities are urging the public to refrain from sharing distressing content online and to report any information they may have.
