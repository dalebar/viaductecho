A Stockport mum opened up about her son’s struggles with ADHD, telling how he expressed feelings of wanting to harm himself due to a lack of support for special educational needs. At a local event, she highlighted his stress from feeling isolated and unsupported in school, noting he thrives when receiving help at home. Another couple shared a similar plight, discussing difficulties in securing a school placement for their daughter, who has complex needs. They've finally secured a spot at a dedicated SEND school after seeking local assistance. The Lib Dems have called for SEND provisions to be treated as essential services, critiquing the government for letting private firms profit while neglecting children’s needs. Local MP Tom Morrison echoed these concerns, stressing the system is "broken" and parents shouldn't have to fight so hard for basic educational support. The overall sentiment reflects a pressing need for reform in the SEND system to ensure every child gets the care and education they deserve.
