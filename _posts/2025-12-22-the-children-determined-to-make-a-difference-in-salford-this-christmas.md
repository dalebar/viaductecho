Kids from Star Salford Academy have done a fantastic job this Christmas by taking over the school kitchen to prepare 200 meals for those in need. On December 19, they whipped up bolognese and vegetarian curry, which was then frozen and sent to Little Hulton Foodbank for distribution. Pupils like Scarlett Loughrey and Ayisha Maria shared their motivation, emphasising the importance of helping those less fortunate, especially as they understand hardship themselves. Coun Teresa Pepper praised the students for their spirit and commitment, highlighting how their actions can reshape the community's outlook. Principal Laura McBride reinforced the school's focus on service and respect, acknowledging the area's challenges and the students' desire to make a positive impact. Additional school initiatives include a fundraising run for St Ann’s Hospice and organising tea for the elderly, showcasing the students’ dedication to community support.
