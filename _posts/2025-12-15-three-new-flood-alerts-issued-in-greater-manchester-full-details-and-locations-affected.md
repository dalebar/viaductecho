Three new flood alerts have hit Greater Manchester this morning, bringing the total to four in the area. The Environment Agency has issued alerts for several regions, including the Lower River Irwell near the city centre, the Middle River Mersey around Stockport, and the River Bollin around Knutsford and Wilmslow. An existing alert for the Upper River Irwell covers parts of Bolton and Bury. Heavy rain is expected to continue, prompting a yellow weather warning from the Met Office. Residents near affected areas are urged to stay prepared and have a flood plan ready. Meanwhile, Manchester Airport has seen flight delays today, partly due to heavy rainfall and a runway closure for repairs. Keep an eye on the updates if you're in those areas!
