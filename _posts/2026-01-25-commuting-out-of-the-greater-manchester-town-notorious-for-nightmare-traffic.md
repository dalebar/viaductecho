Littleborough is grappling with serious traffic issues, worsened by recent housing developments that locals have vocally opposed. The council recently approved a 309-home project on Hollingworth Road and another 199 homes off Smithy Bridge Road, igniting frustration among residents who believe more people will exacerbate already congested roads. Commuting to Manchester is challenging, often taking 20 minutes to cover just three miles due to traffic lights and roadworks. Local councillors are advocating for better transport options, with Coun Billy Sheerin stressing the need for a cultural shift away from car reliance towards cycling and public transport. There's talk of a long-awaited relief road to help manage A58 traffic, with financial backing confirmed, yet no concrete plans exist yet. Rochdale's MP is pushing for quicker resolution to roadworks, aiming to impose penalties on companies causing disruption. Despite resistance from locals over the housing plans, projections indicate over 600 new homes could pop up soon, coupled with the seasonal tourist influx leading to even more gridlock. Overall, community voices are clear: effective long-term transport solutions are crucial for Littleborough’s future.
