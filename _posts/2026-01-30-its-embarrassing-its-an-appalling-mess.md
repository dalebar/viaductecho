Residents near Medlock Road in Oldham are fuming over rampant fly-tipping that's become a real eyesore in the community. The area is littered with all sorts of junk—fridges, mattresses, and even a sheep's skull—leaving locals feeling 'disgusted and embarrassed.' Mark Brooks, a resident and cleaning business owner, expressed frustration over the dangerous mess, which he’s reluctant to approach due to potential hazards. Vicky Akin, a long-term local, echoed these concerns, highlighting the negative impact on visits from friends and family. Despite reporting the issue multiple times, residents feel ignored by the council. Local groups have proposed solutions like CCTV and making the road a 'No Through Road,' but have faced setbacks. Coun Elaine Taylor, Oldham’s Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods, acknowledged the problem and promised more clean-ups and deterrents, stating that this unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated. The community is eager for action, hoping for a return to their once lovely neighbourhood.
