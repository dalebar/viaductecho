High Peak Comps is running exciting competitions this September, giving you the chance to win big. You could snag a staggering £50,000 for just 49p per ticket, with the draw taking place on Sunday, 28 September. You can buy up to 2,000 tickets! They've also got a Leprechaun contest with a £100,000 prize pot, featuring smaller cash wins and an automatic entry into a £10,000 draw. Daily winners like Claire Wood, who recently claimed £800, make it even more enticing. 

Beyond just competitions, High Peak Comps supports local causes, donating food and prizes to shelters and food banks. Since launching in March 2020, they've given away an impressive £10 million in prizes. Check out their contests and join in the fun—who knows, you could be the next big winner!
