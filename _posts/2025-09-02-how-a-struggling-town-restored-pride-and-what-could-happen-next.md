In 2015, Stockport faced challenges with its town centre, witnessing declining footfall and hesitant businesses. However, a £1bn regeneration scheme led to significant developments, including the Redrock leisure complex, which opened in 2017, featuring a cinema and restaurants that boosted visitor numbers. The Stockport Exchange business district emerged, enhancing local employment opportunities with new offices and facilities like a Holiday Inn Express. The council's purchase of Merseyway shopping centre included plans for new office spaces and innovation hubs. Recent developments like Stockroom and the transformed Stockport Interchange further revitalised the area, paving the way for better transport links and increased community engagement. Over 1,200 new homes have already been added, with plans for 8,000 more in the next 15 years, alongside improved social infrastructure. Council leader Mark Roberts highlighted the successful transformation of Stockport into a vibrant place people want to visit and live in, while ambitious plans continue to shape its future.
