Back in 2015, Stockport's town centre was facing challenges with businesses feeling disconnected and investment dwindling. But a £1bn regeneration plan was set in motion, starting with the Redrock leisure project, which opened in 2017, featuring a cinema and eateries, helping to boost footfall. The Stockport Exchange, a new business hub, also emerged, attracting companies with excellent transport links and modern office space.

Significant developments followed, including the revitalisation of Merseyway shopping centre and the 2023 opening of the Merseyway Innovation Centre for startups. The new Stockroom turned vacant shops into cultural spaces, drawing record visitors.

Transport upgrades led to the 2024 opening of Stockport Interchange, signalling further improvements and future connections. The town has seen over 1,200 new homes built and aims for 8,000 more in the next 15 years.

Plans for a walkable neighbourhood with green spaces and new homes are underway, with ambitions for social infrastructure to support the growing population. Overall, the transformation has revitalised Stockport, restoring pride and creating a vibrant community.
