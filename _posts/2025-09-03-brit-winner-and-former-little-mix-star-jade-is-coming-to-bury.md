Jade Thirlwall, the former Little Mix star and recent Brit Award winner, is set to visit Bury on September 13 for a special album signing event at Wax and Beans, Buryâ€™s only independent record store. This event promotes her debut album, "That's Showbiz Baby!", due for release on September 12. After launching her solo career following Little Mix's hiatus in 2022, Jade's been quite busy with hit singles like "Plastic Box" and "IT Girl". The signing at midday is already fully booked, reflecting her popularity. She'll also be touring other UK cities including London and Birmingham, but this will be her only Manchester stop until her solo tour in October. Expect her back at the O2 Victoria Warehouse on October 12. Jade's excited about connecting with fans, describing her upcoming tour as "magical". Fans can catch all the latest gig news and updates through local outlets like the Manchester Evening News.
