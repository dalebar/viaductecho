Helen McHale, CEO of Stockport Homes and a major figure in social housing for four decades, is retiring after 20 years in the role. Under her leadership, Stockport Homes, established in 2005, has grown significantly and currently manages over 12,000 properties. Helen’s tenure has been marked by a commitment to improving housing services, transforming the organisation from a ‘zero-star’ to a ‘high-performing’ provider. She plans to oversee a regulatory inspection before stepping down, reflecting on her achievements and the challenges faced, including the growing demand for affordable homes. Despite facing criticism for repair delays, Stockport Homes has made strides in addressing backlogs. The council leader praised her for her impact on the community, while the chair of the board highlighted her dedication over the years. Helen views her retirement as an opportunity for new leadership to emerge while she enjoys more personal time.
