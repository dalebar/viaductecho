Greater Manchester Police (GMP) is set to roll out Live Facial Recognition (LFR) technology in Stockport following successful trials in Manchester. The plan involves using vans equipped with LFR cameras to scan crowds and match faces against a watchlist of wanted individuals and missing persons. Since its introduction in October 2025, LFR has resulted in 40 arrests, including 30 charges, with one in five arrests involving registered sex offenders. GMP has deployed these cameras 23 times at locations such as Piccadilly Gardens and Manchester Airport, even using them during the Manchester Derby football match. Inspector Jon Middleton highlighted that this proactive measure allows quicker police intervention, enhancing public safety. The watchlist includes vulnerable individuals, suspects, and those breaching court conditions. Sergeant Ryan Magee praised LFR as a vital tool for improving public protection and proactive policing.
