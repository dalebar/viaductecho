In January, while many focus on New Year resolutions, Life Leisure in Stockport emphasises how exercise impacts your well-being. Sue’s story highlights this approach perfectly. After caring for her parents until their passing, she was inspired by her father’s active lifestyle into his 90s. Seeking strength and vitality, Sue joined Life Leisure, sharing that the experience boosts her energy and mood. The classes, especially R1G and HYROX, have not only enhanced her physical strength but also her mental health, providing a supportive community that helps her unwind from daily stresses. Sue loves the vibrant atmosphere and feels stronger, especially as a beekeeper! Most members at Life Leisure are motivated by how exercise makes them feel rather than aesthetics, focusing on the joy of movement instead. So, if you're in Stockport, why not give it a go and discover your spark? Check out their offerings at www.lifeleisure.net.
