On Tuesday, Stockport's in for a cloudy day with lots of rain, temperatures will be between 12°C and 15°C. Humidity's high at 79%, and there's a 100% chance of rain, so best pack your brolly! Expect strong winds up to 37 mph, which could make it feel chillier. 

If you’re commuting, allow extra time as the weather may slow you down, especially if you're using public transport or driving, as roads could get slippery. It might be a smart idea to stick to indoor plans, and if you do head out, dress in layers with waterproof gear. Stay updated on the latest weather forecasts so you can navigate your day safely.
