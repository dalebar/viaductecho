Children's services in Wigan have been rated as 'good' by Ofsted, a big upgrade from the previous ‘requires improvement’ in 2020. After an 11-day inspection in October, the report highlighted considerable advancements since the last review, particularly in the leadership and management of these services. The council’s commitment to enhancing support for children and care leavers was noted, with they being praised for their child-centred approach. While the progress of children in care was marked as 'outstanding,' the area for those needing help and protection still needs improvement. Issues regarding the quality of initial contact services were also highlighted as needing attention. Coun Dane Anderton expressed pride in the workforce’s dedication and affirmed ongoing efforts to refine their services. Overall, Wigan's children's services are making significant strides, with a focus on continuous improvement.
