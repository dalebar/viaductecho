Antisemitism is a sign of societal issues, and over the last two years, the UK has faced significant tension. While we’ve experienced a dark narrative, the Jewish community has shown remarkable resilience following recent attacks, including a serious act of violence against British Jews. Synagogues, even under the watch of riot police, were busy during the Sukkot festival, highlighting community strength and commitment to heritage. However, the ongoing threat has forced unnecessary security measures in what should be a civilised society. Sympathy is welcome, but the community needs decisive action to combat the unchecked rise of antisemitism. There’s an urgent call for political and civil leaders to step up, engage in meaningful dialogue, and address the root issues to prevent future tragedies. Antisemitism cannot be brushed off as a reaction to foreign conflicts; it must be condemned outright. The attack on Heaton Park Synagogue is not the end; the community will mourn, rebuild, and stay firm against intimidation. Now’s the time for the silent majority to speak up and for all groups to take a stand against racism in any form.
