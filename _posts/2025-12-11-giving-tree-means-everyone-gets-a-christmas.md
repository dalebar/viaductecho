Students from a Greater Manchester school took part in a heartwarming project to ensure kids wake up to presents on Christmas morning. Working with Merseyway and Stockport Council's neighbourhood team, 18 schools were involved in identifying families struggling to afford gifts. Shopping centre manager Victoria Nichol shared that this initiative is now in its seventh year and continues to grow. Pupil Allarna highlighted the power of community, stating that everyone can meet their needs when they come together. Fellow student Youssef emphasised the importance of such projects, ensuring everyone gets to enjoy Christmas.
