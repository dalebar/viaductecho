A year after the launch of the Farnworth Green development, concerns are mounting over the number of empty commercial units. Councillor Paul Sanders highlighted that while the residential part has thrived—with all 97 homes fully let—the six vacant retail spaces have left many feeling the promised vibrant town centre hasn't materialised. Although there's interest from businesses like Cotton café and a possible move for the library, the developer, Capital & Centric, insists on a careful selection of tenants rather than rushing to fill the spaces with transient shops. Tim Heatley, co-founder of Capital & Centric, acknowledged local frustrations but stressed the importance of curating a diverse mix of businesses to attract a wider audience. While some establishments, like a coffee house and a pilates studio, have opened, many residents are still questioning the success of the overall regeneration project and why more shops—particularly desired bars and independent retailers—remain unoccupied.
