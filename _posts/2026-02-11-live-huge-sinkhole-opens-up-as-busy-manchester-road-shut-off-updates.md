A sinkhole has appeared on Briscoe Lane in Newton Heath, Manchester, leading to road closures and disruption. Contractors are on-site, and United Utilities is working to fix a burst pipe affecting local water supply. Residents are dealing with low water pressure or no water at all, with some businesses forced to close. In response, United Utilities has deployed water tankers to help keep taps running. They've acknowledged the inconvenience and promised efficient repairs. Affected residents have reported receiving buckets of water, but it's still tough for those without access. Live updates are ongoing as the situation develops.
