Four schools in Stockport have been named among the North West's finest by The Sunday Times in their 'Parent Power Guide for 2026'. Cheadle Hulme School, Cheadle Hulme High, Hazel Grove High, and Stockport Grammar School all made the list. Cheadle Hulme High was highlighted as the second-best comprehensive secondary and 10th overall in state secondary schools. Hazel Grove High ranked fourth for comprehensives. Both Cheadle Hulme School and Stockport Grammar shone in the independent category, placing ninth and tenth respectively. Other notable mentions include The Manchester Grammar School, named Independent Secondary School of the Year, and Holy Cross RC High School in Chorley, honoured as the best state 11-16 Secondary School. The guide, now in its 33rd year, is a respected ranking source for primary and secondary education in the UK, with editor Helen Davies recognising the challenges educators face while celebrating their innovative efforts to enrich student lives. The guide features a searchable database of over 2,000 schools.
