In Burnage, a local dad’s refusing to engage with Labour campaigners, reflecting the intense vibe around the Gorton and Denton by-election. It's been a fierce contest, filled with political drama, including effigies and allegations of election offences. But this tough competition has sparked local interest, drawing in folks from all walks of life who are keen to get involved. The main candidates, each with strong ties to Manchester, include Angeliki Stogia from Labour, the Greens' “Hannah the plumber,” and Reform UK's Matt Goodwin, who's stirring controversy with his views. The battle has become a referendum on Keir Starmer’s leadership, with candidates facing critical issues like poverty and immigration head-on. For many, what matters most is how the new MP will tackle poverty, particularly in a constituency grappling with unemployment and rogue landlords. This election is a reflection of the UK’s ideological divide, bringing genuine passion back into politics, as constituents prepare to make their voices heard on February 26.
