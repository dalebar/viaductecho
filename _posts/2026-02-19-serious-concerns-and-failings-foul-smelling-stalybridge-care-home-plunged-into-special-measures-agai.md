Parkhill Nursing Home in Stalybridge is in hot water again, landing itself back in special measures after a scathing report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The home, which can house up to 38 residents, has been deemed 'inadequate' multiple times and has serious issues with hygiene and care. Residents reportedly have dirty nails, teeth, and were only getting showers about once a week. Staffing levels are insufficient, causing delays in support and early wake-ups for some residents. Important repairs haven't been done, and there’s been no registered manager for years, which is a regulatory must. The CQC found continuous breaches in care standards and has stepped up regulatory action to ensure resident safety. Inspectors are now closely monitoring the home while the management promises to work with partners for improvements. It’s a worrying situation for the residents and their families, and it feels like a long road ahead for Parkhill to get its act together.
