A 42-year-old man, Scott Atkinson, has been charged after he was caught attacking cars with a shovel on Ashton Old Road in Openshaw, east Manchester, on December 1. Police arrived around 3:30pm following disturbance reports. Atkinson allegedly tried to harm an officer, prompting the use of a taser for his arrest. He faces charges including attempted grievous bodily harm, affray, and criminal damage, and is set to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on December 3. Additionally, he’s implicated in another incident in Salford on the same day, facing multiple charges such as theft, false imprisonment, and driving without a licence. Thankfully, no injuries were reported during the chaos.
