Shop owners at the Longfield Centre in Prestwich have been ordered to vacate by April 7 for a £100m regeneration project. Remaining businesses, including You & Me Cafe and a Bury hospice shop, are feeling the pinch as they scramble to find new locations. Many shops have already closed due to the building's poor condition, leaving only eight enterprises still operating. Bury Council has allocated £1m for demolition and £2.25m for preparatory works ahead of a planning application due in March. Business owners are understandably upset, with one expressing concern over moving costs and lack of clarity on future locations. Meanwhile, Prestwich Library will temporarily relocate to the Phoenix Centre until their new home is ready. The Longfield Centre's demolition is part of a broader regeneration plan aimed at transforming the area into a vibrant hub. Council representatives stress their commitment to supporting affected businesses and the community throughout this transition, despite the inevitable disruption.
