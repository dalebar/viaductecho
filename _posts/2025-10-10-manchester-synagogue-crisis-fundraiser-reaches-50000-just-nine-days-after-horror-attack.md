A crisis fundraiser launched after a terrible attack at a Manchester synagogue has raised £50,000 in just nine days. The funds will support the victims and families affected, provide resources for the Jewish community like counselling and recovery initiatives, and repair the synagogue itself. The attack on October 2 saw Syrian-born Brit Jihad Al-Shamie drive his vehicle at worshippers and use knives, resulting in the deaths of two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, while four others were injured. Al-Shamie was shot dead by police during the incident. The community has been deeply shaken, as expressed in the fundraiser's message, urging for solidarity and support to help heal and recover. Six other suspects were initially arrested in connection with the attack, but most have since been released. Jihad Al-Shamie had lived in Crumpsall and was granted British citizenship in 2006. Hopes for the community's strength and unity persist despite the tragic events.
