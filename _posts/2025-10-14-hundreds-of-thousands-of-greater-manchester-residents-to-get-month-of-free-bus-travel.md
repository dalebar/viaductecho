Next month, TfGM will roll out free bus travel for the elderly and disabled 24/7, following the success of a pilot scheme in August. Previously, free travel was only available on weekdays after 9.30am. Now, up to 400,000 eligible folks will enjoy free bus rides all day, including on night buses. This move follows a call for a permanent extension from 44 local charities, including Citizens Advice and the Trussell Trust. Mayor Andy Burnham hailed the last trial's success, noting over 100,000 early morning trips made by older and disabled passengers. The aim is to enhance accessibility and support for the community, helping individuals access work, shopping, and medical appointments. Charities emphasised the importance of free travel for social inclusion and mental health, ensuring older residents remain connected and active. The results from both pilot phases will inform decisions about making the scheme permanent.
