Parents of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Manchester are expressing frustration over the council’s support system, highlighting long waiting times and denial of assistance. Many families report waiting up to a year for independent tribunal decisions after their initial requests for help are rejected. The application process is described as complex, forcing parents to become well-versed in SEN law, which adds unnecessary anxiety and stress.

Several case studies illustrate the issues, like one mother’s struggle to secure an education and health care plan (EHCP) for her son diagnosed with autism, who was denied assessment based on his academic ability. Other parents shared experiences of their children being out of school for extended periods, facing unsafe conditions, or lacking proper educational placements altogether.

While Manchester City Council reports creating new specialist places to meet demand, parents feel overwhelmed by the inadequate support and lack of accountability. They indicate that the system often disregards professional advice, pushing many to seek tribunal rulings just to get the necessary help for their children.
