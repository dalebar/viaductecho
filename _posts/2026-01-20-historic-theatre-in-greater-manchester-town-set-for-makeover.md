Rochdale's Curtain Theatre, a 1920s gem, is set for a much-needed makeover as part of a major regeneration scheme. With a fresh façade inspired by its iconic red colour, the 180-seat venue will feature new signage and lighting while benefiting from a multi-million-pound investment in the surrounding area. This ambitious project, led by the Rochdale Development Agency, includes plans for a new station square and residential spaces at the former central retail park. The aim is to attract new audiences and enhance the look of Milkstone Road. Coun Sue Smith from Rochdale Borough Council expressed excitement over the progress, emphasising its cultural significance. Danny Groves, the theatre's business director, highlighted that the revamped exterior will convey the theatre's special nature and draw in visitors. This initiative aligns with Rochdale's designation as Greater Manchester Town of Culture, complementing other cultural enhancements in the community.
