Greater Manchester is feeling the chill from a cold weather front, with a yellow ice warning effective until 10am Wednesday. Although temperatures are set to rise a tad, Storm Goretti is on the way, bringing snow and strong winds for Thursday and Friday. Manchester Airport is running smoothly with its snow-clearing team ready if needed, though flights to Amsterdam are grounded for the sixth day due to heavy winter conditions in the Netherlands. Schiphol Airport has cancelled over 700 flights, mainly affecting European routes. If you’re flying soon, keep an eye on your flight status; recent cancellations and delays include multiple KLM and easyJet flights to Amsterdam and Paris, along with some other European destinations.
