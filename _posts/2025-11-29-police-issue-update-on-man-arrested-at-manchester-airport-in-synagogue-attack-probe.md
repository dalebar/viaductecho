Police have nabbed a seventh suspect in the ongoing investigation into last month's terrorist attack at Heaton Park synagogue. A 31-year-old man was arrested at Manchester Airport on November 27, suspected of planning or preparing acts of terrorism. He’s set to remain in custody for up to a week following a warrant that allows for further questioning. This brings the total arrests to seven, including a previous suspect on bail for not disclosing information related to the case. Tragically, the attack, carried out by Jihad Al Shamie on October 2, resulted in the deaths of Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, while several others were injured. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts urged anyone with information or who witnessed the incident to come forward and reach out through the Major Incident Public Portal or call 0161 856 3946 for support.
