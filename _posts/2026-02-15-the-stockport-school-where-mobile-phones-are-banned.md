Schools are facing issues with mobile phones affecting pupils' engagement and social interactions, leading many to impose bans. Stockport Grammar School, for example, has introduced Yondr pouches that keep phones locked away during school hours. This initiative aims to enhance face-to-face interactions and has reportedly created a calmer learning environment. Students have embraced the routine, preferring social activities over screen time during breaks. Feedback indicates that families are generally in favour of the change, while some education experts suggest that limiting screen use improves behaviour and reduces online anxiety.

However, there's ongoing debate over a blanket ban on social media for under-16s. While some support such measures post-tragedies like the murder of Brianna Ghey, over 40 child protection groups caution that these approaches only address symptoms, not underlying issues. A significant study from The University of Manchester found no direct link between social media use and mental health problems in teens, suggesting that context matters. What do you think about the phone bans and social media restrictions?
