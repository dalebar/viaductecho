If you're dreaming of a white Christmas in Greater Manchester, it looks like you might be disappointed. Starting December 22, the week brings sunny intervals with temperatures above average, peaking at 11C. However, expect clouds to gather later in the day, especially in areas like Oldham, Rochdale, and Tameside. Tuesday is set to be gloomier, with highs of 9C and lows of 4C. The forecast shines a bit for Christmas Eve, Day, and Boxing Day, with sunny spells expected, particularly on Boxing Day morning. Highs will hover around 7C, dropping to 2C to 4C at night. Unfortunately, grey skies are likely to return over the weekend. The Met Office is predicting a less-than-five per cent chance of rain until Saturday night, which rules out any chance of a white Christmas. So, keep your spirits high for some festive sunshine instead!
