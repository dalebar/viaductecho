There's been a significant emergency response in east Manchester tonight after an incident on Clayton Street. The area is cordoned off, with police and paramedic vehicles present, including armed officers and a police helicopter. Local resident Marie witnessed an injured man being treated by paramedics before he was taken away in an ambulance. While the cordon has shrunk, Flint Close remains taped off as officers continue their investigations. Details about the incident are still unclear, and Greater Manchester Police are yet to release a statement. Updates will follow as the situation develops. It's a bit unnerving for locals to see such activity on their streets.
