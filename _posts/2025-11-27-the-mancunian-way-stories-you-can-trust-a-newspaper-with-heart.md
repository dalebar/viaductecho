The Manchester Evening News (M.E.N.) has been a staple for 157 years, adapting from a traditional newspaper to a modern multi-platform presence. As part of its evolution, it recently launched Manchester Evening News Premium, providing a better journalism experience with fewer ads. Subscribers can access exclusive articles, a daily News Digest, in-depth features, and puzzles through the app. Acknowledging the importance of trusted journalism amid misinformation, M.E.N. aims to keep Manchester informed and engaged. The membership is affordable, starting at £4.99 a month, helping sustain quality local reporting. Exciting content is on the way, including features from long-serving staff and discussions with notable locals. On the practical side, the weather in Greater Manchester is expected to be breezy but bright, while roadworks will disrupt multiple motorways, so plan accordingly!
