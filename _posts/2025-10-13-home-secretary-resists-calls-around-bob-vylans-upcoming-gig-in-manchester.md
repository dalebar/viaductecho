The Home Secretary has declined calls to cancel Bob Vylan's upcoming gig at Manchester Academy, scheduled for November 5, following a synagogue attack. Shabana Mahmood emphasised that safety advisory groups should assess local safety before making such decisions. This comes after concerns were raised about Vylan following controversial remarks at Glastonbury, where he chanted aggressive slogans related to the Israel Defense Forces amid rising tensions in Gaza. Ten Greater Manchester MPs, including Rochdale's Paul Waugh, have urged for the concert's cancellation, citing threats to the Jewish community. Mahmood reiterated that concert decisions should be based on evidence and the discretion of safety advisors. The University of Manchester Students' Union, managing the venue, has yet to respond to these developments. Bob Vylan, currently on their "We Won't Go Quietly" tour, insists their message is about free speech rather than incitement, stating they're targeted for voicing their views.
