A shooting in Manchester's Gay Village has left a man in his 20s injured but with non-life-threatening injuries. The incident occurred around 5am on January 24 on Richmond Street, prompting armed officers to respond to a disturbance. The police discovered a gun at the scene and arrested six men, aged 23 to 26, who are now in custody for questioning. Authorities believe the attack was targeted and pose no wider threat to the area. Cordons are set up on Richmond and Princess Street, with investigations focusing on a Mercedes G-Class car within the cordoned area. The police are asking for witnesses and any relevant CCTV or dashcam footage to come forward, urging anyone with information to contact GMP quoting log 600 of 24/01/2026.
