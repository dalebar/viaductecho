Last night in Manchester, a peaceful protest about the Syrian conflict turned chaotic around 8pm. Starting out calmly, the demonstration escalated into violence on Wilmslow Road in Rusholme, known as the Curry Mile. A large group began damaging property and vehicles, and tensions flared as they threw items at police. Witnesses reported that some protesters carried Kurdish flags. As the situation intensified with shattered car windows and shouting, police enforced a dispersal order, closing Wilmslow Road and sending in riot-trained Tactical Aid Units. Fortunately, no arrests were made. Superintendent Stephen Wiggins noted that while they support peaceful protests, they would take strong action against any disorder. The situation was cleared by 10pm, and the police are now reviewing CCTV footage to identify those responsible, asking the public for information if they have any.
