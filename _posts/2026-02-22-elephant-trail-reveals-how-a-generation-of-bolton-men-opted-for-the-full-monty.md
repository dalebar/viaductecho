A new heritage trail in Bolton highlights the town's quirky connection to elephants, prominently featured on its coat of arms since 1890. The Halliwell and Smithills Elephant Trail (HASET) currently has four stations, but local volunteers, led by artist John Pindar, aim to expand it to 20. The trail includes artworks like a watercolour cartoon and a ceramic plaque, each detailing local history using QR codes. This weekend, Nadeem Ayub, a local councillor, will unveil a mural of Bertie the Elephant wearing a three-piece suit, celebrating Bolton's tailoring history linked to Montague Burton. The trail not only showcases Bolton's rich cultural heritage but also seeks to draw in tourists, encouraging locals to connect with their roots through art and history. Alongside Bertie's station, you'll find others featuring elephants in different contexts, from police uniforms to school depictions, each reflecting the area's past while sprucing up the community.
