Heavy rain is hitting Greater Manchester today, with showers expected to continue into the evening before easing off around 9pm. It’ll be a bit nippy, reaching around 6°C but feeling more like 3°C. Tomorrow, though, it’s looking brighter! After the rain clears overnight, Sunday should bring sunny spells and mostly dry conditions, despite a few clouds in the afternoon, with similar chilly temperatures. The Met Office noted a yellow weather warning for rain is in place for other parts of the UK, predicting 20-30 mm of rain and potential flooding issues. Luckily, the North West has managed to avoid this warning. Overall, it’s a mixed bag of weather, but we might just sneak in some sunny moments by the end of the weekend!
