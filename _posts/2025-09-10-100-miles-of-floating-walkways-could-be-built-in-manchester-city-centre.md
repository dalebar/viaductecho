A vibrant new project called CyanLines aims to create a 100-mile network of walking routes across Manchester, featuring brightly-coloured walkways over the River Irwell. Estimated to cost at least £100m over the next decade, this initiative will connect the city’s parks, rivers, and canals with updated signage and routes on the Komoot app. Proposed features include floating wooden paths and jetties for boats, alongside cycling lanes. Although still in the early idea stage, it could extend the existing Castlefield Viaduct park. With backing from various public and private organisations, including the Manchester council, town hall leader Bev Craig is keen on making the city greener. Currently, 15.5 miles (25km) of routes are already introduced. An overseeing organisation will manage infrastructure projects and community events while encouraging tourism and volunteer involvement through a 'Friends of the CyanLines' group. Exciting times ahead as this initiative aims to transform Manchester's outdoor spaces!
