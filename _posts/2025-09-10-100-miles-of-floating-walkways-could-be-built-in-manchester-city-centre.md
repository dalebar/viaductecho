Manchester's set to get a vibrant new walking network called CyanLines, aiming to span 100 miles and connect parks, rivers, and canals. Costing at least Â£100 million over the next decade, it envisions colourful walkways over the River Irwell, complete with jetties and cycle lanes. While it's still in the early idea phase, the initiative could extend the existing Castlefield Viaduct park too. Backed by various organisations, including Manchester council, the town hall leader, Bev Craig, is keen to make the city greener. Currently, 15.5 miles of routes have already been revealed, and an organisation is being formed to oversee developments, host events, and promote tourism. There are plans for a 'Friends of the CyanLines' volunteer group as well. Exciting stuff for Mancunians looking to enjoy more green spaces!
