In 2015, Stockport faced challenges with its high street as businesses struggled and investment stalled. However, plans for a Â£1bn regeneration were set in motion, starting with the Redrock leisure scheme, which opened in 2017 and included a cinema, restaurants, and a multi-storey car park. This initiative helped increase footfall, with cinema admissions reported up 10% year-on-year.

The Stockport Exchange, a business district, began renovations in 2015, attracting companies with excellent transport links and new developments like a Holiday Inn Express. The council's purchase of the Merseyway shopping centre in 2016 also aimed to revitalise retail. Recent projects include the Merseyway Innovation Centre and Stockroom, both focused on creative spaces.

Transport improvements, such as the Stockport Interchange planned for 2024, are crucial for future infrastructure. The Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation has facilitated over 1,200 new homes and revitalised historic areas. Upcoming developments plan to add another 1,300 homes and enhance social infrastructure, marking remarkable progress in transforming Stockport into a vibrant destination.
