In 2015, Stockport faced challenges in revitalising its town centre, but a £1bn regeneration scheme was set in motion, leading to significant improvements. Key developments included the opening of Redrock in 2017, a £45m leisure zone featuring a 10-screen cinema and restaurants, which boosted footfall. The Stockport Exchange business district emerged with new offices and a Holiday Inn Express, attracting major companies. The council revitalised the Merseyway shopping centre and introduced the innovative Stockroom space for local startups and community engagement. Transport upgrades, including the new Stockport Interchange, improved connectivity and set the stage for future projects. More than 1,200 homes have been built since the establishment of the Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation in 2019, with more on the way. The Underbanks area is now trendy, packed with independent shops and eateries. Events like Krazy Races have drawn large crowds, enhancing community spirit. Looking ahead, plans for a walkable neighbourhood with additional homes and green spaces have been approved, contributing to a thriving future for Stockport. Council leader Mark Roberts highlighted the successful transformation of underused spaces into vibrant destinations, aiming to foster a sense of pride and community.
