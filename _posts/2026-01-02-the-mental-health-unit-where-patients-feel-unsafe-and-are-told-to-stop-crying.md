Cygnet Kenney House in Oldham has been told to shape up by the CQC after a scathing report highlighted serious concerns, including patients receiving out-of-date medications and inadequate staff support. The inspection revealed that safety standards were rated as ‘inadequate’, with reports of poor staffing levels and slow responses to patient needs. Disturbingly, one distressed woman was told by staff to ‘stop crying’. In their assessment, inspectors noted that two wards struggled with unavailability of prescribed medications for over a week, and staff weren't properly tracking food and fluid intake for patients. While some patients reported positive experiences with staff, others expressed feeling unsafe and waiting too long for help. Hospital manager Jennifer Healey stated that patient safety is a top priority and that an improvement plan focusing on safety and training has already been put in place following the inspection. She’s optimistic about showing progress at the next evaluation.
