Five areas in Greater Manchester have made it to the top 20 best places to live in the 2026 Garrington report. Marple tops the list, praised for its charm, strong community spirit, and proximity to the Peak District, despite its average house price of £517,119 being above the national average. Other notable spots include Bramhall, Reddish, central Stockport, and Bowdon. The report scores locations based on natural beauty, wellbeing, heritage, schools, jobs, and value for money. The trend shows a narrowing north-south divide, with northern areas becoming more affordable while southern prices fall. Despite recent housing market pauses, interest is surging as mortgage rates drop, giving buyers more flexibility. Whether you’re after schools or scenic views, the 2026 guide is a handy tool for finding your perfect spot!
