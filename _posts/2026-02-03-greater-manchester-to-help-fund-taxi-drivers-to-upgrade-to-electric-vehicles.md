Stockport is set to welcome more electric taxis thanks to a new £4.45m fund from Transport for Greater Manchester aimed at helping taxi drivers switch to cleaner vehicles. The Private Hire Vehicle Support Fund will offer private hire vehicle owners a £5,000 interest-free loan or a £1,000 non-repayable grant. This initiative targets the improvement of air quality, as currently, about one in ten private hire vehicles don’t meet emission standards. Applications for the funding will open in May. Additionally, there's an £8m support package for black cab drivers to transition to electric vehicles; already, 190 drivers have made the switch since the programme started in December 2022. Mayor Andy Burnham emphasised the city's commitment to supporting drivers in this transition to cleaner air while maintaining high standards and public safety.
