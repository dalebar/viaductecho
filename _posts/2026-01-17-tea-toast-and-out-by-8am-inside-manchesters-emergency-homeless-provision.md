The Etrop Grange hotel in Wythenshawe, once a banqueting suite, now serves as temporary accommodation for Manchester's homeless. On a chilly night, it offers warm camp beds for those in need, especially when temperatures drop below zero. Users, referred by the council's Rough Sleepers service, can stay the night but must leave by 8am. Despite some reluctance from the homeless to accept offers, staff passionately support their efforts to get people indoors, providing essentials like hot drinks and donated items. Since the severe weather protocol began, the council has made numerous accommodation offers, with many accepted, though some remain unoccupied. Deputy Council Leader Cllr Joanna Midgley emphasises the importance of understanding the complexities faced by those sleeping rough and the need for compassionate outreach. The aim is to help individuals navigate the system and ultimately find long-term housing, bringing them one step closer to having their own front door.
