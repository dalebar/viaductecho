Manchester’s Charles Street is set for a major transformation as plans for a £1.7 billion ‘Sister’ development aim to replace the existing multi-storey car park with eye-catching skyscrapers. Designed by RG Real Estate, the new building will include a mix of 1,041 student bedrooms and commercial spaces spread over 38, 10, and 8 storeys. The design nods to local architectural influences, like the modernist Renold Building and the French renaissance-style Sackville Building, reflecting Manchester’s rich heritage while delivering a contemporary vibe. This development is part of a broader effort to relocate students closer to university campuses, with a significant increase in student accommodation planned. Feedback on the designs is welcomed until December 16, with a public consultation event happening on December 8. The aim is to meet the growing demand for quality student living in the city centre, ideally situated near both The University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University.
