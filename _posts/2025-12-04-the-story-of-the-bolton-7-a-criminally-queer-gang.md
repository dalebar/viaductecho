In February 1998, the Bolton 7, seven gay and bisexual men, faced prosecution in Manchester for engaging in consensual group sex, despite homosexuality being legal. The case hinged on a little-known clause in the 1967 Sexual Offences Act, which criminalised acts involving more than two people. The trial sparked public outrage and media scrutiny, leading to violent backlash against the men, including job losses and harassment. Activists and organisations like Amnesty International supported them, while prominent figures, including MP Dr Evan Harris, condemned the legal proceedings as unjust. The intense scrutiny and stigmatisation surrounding the case helped ignite further LGBTQ+ rights campaigns, ultimately leading to changes in laws, including lowering the age of consent to match heterosexual laws. The Bolton 7 were given probation and community service, with some later appealing successfully. The case has largely been overlooked in history, but has inspired a new podcast, "Criminally Queer: The Bolton 7," which explores its significance. Activists note that, while legal rights have progressed, vigilance is still needed against rising discrimination, especially targeting the trans community. The podcast is now available on all major platforms.
