Steve Diggle recounts the pivotal moment that birthed Buzzcocks during the legendary Sex Pistols gig at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall on June 4, 1976. He cheekily claims he only joined the band due to a mix-up, having responded to a "BASS PLAYER NEEDED" ad despite not being a proper bassist. That night, he met Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, and they instantly clicked, marking the beginning of their musical journey. Diggle notes that while the Pistols often get the credit, Buzzcocks actually ignited the indie scene, blending incisive lyrics and catchy pop-punk sounds. They delivered classics like "Orgasm Addict," which pushed boundaries and defined a genre. Despite their massive influence and continued popularity—even landing features in films and ads—the band often feels overlooked in Manchester’s music narrative. Now, on their 50th anniversary, Buzzcocks are set to tour again and release a new album filled with fresh sounds and themes. Diggle reflects fondly on his late bandmate Pete and aims to keep the spirit of Buzzcocks alive without becoming a tribute act. His memoir, *Autonomy: Portrait of a Buzzcock*, is out now.
