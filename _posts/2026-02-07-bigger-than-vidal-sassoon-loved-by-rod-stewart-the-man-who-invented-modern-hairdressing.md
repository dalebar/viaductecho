Pierre Alexandre, a Swiss-born British hairdresser, began his career in a modest Manchester salon and rose to fame in the 70s and 80s, becoming a beloved figure among stars like David Bowie and Rod Stewart. Renowned for his innovation, he introduced styles like the softened bob and spiky haircut, and was a pioneer of unisex salons.

Born Peter Johann Franz Walser in Basel, he moved to the UK in 1960, adopting the name Pierre Alexandre. He opened his first salon in Manchester in 1965, attracting high-profile clients. His flair for creativity extended to establishing the Pierre Alexandre School of Hairdressing and multiple international venues, including a boutique in Paris.

Though he missed broader commercial opportunities, his influence on stylists and trends in hairdressing is undeniable. Alexandre passed away recently at 86, leaving behind a legacy cherished by colleagues and clients alike. Tributes highlight his remarkable talent and the joy he found in helping others succeed, solidifying his status as an icon in Manchester's hairdressing scene.
