Bury council is winding up Six Town Housing (STH), its former arms-length management company for social housing. In February 2024, the council took back most of the borough's social homes, but STH still managed some specialist properties. A strategic review revealed that STH’s governance posed regulatory risks and was unviable, requiring too much senior leadership for the limited housing it offered. The council plans to agree on recommendations to de-register STH, closing it completely and transferring its assets either back to the council or to third parties. With no paid staff left, STH is solely managed by its board and relies on the council for housing management. The closure process is set to take about 18 months and cost the council £500,000. The council aims to choose suitable landlords for the remaining assets while prioritising the impact of the closure on tenants, ensuring they are consulted throughout the process.
