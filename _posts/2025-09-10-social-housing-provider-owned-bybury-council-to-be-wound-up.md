Bury Council is winding up Six Town Housing (STH), its former arms-length management company for social housing. In February 2024, most social homes in the borough were brought back under council management. Although STH still owned 149 specialist properties, a strategic review deemed it “unviable” due to governance risks and inefficiencies. Council recommendations will lead to STH being de-registered from the housing regulator and dissolved, with properties either transferred to the council or sold. With no paid staff, STH currently relies on Bury Council for management. The closure process is expected to take 18 months and cost about £500,000. Ensuring tenants’ interests are a priority throughout the transition is emphasised, with consultations planned for those affected.
