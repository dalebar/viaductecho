Oldham Rugby League Club (ORLFC) is still playing its home games in Tameside due to a feud with Oldham Athletic over Boundary Park. This Friday, February 20, they’ll face Widnes Vikings at Bower Fold Stadium instead of their usual spot in Chadderton. The conflict stems from a financial dispute regarding access to Boundary Park, which underwent a £1m renovation for shared use. While ORLFC claims it has been blocked from the grounds, Latics deny this and state Boundary Park is available as per their agreement. ORLFC has requested mediation, which Latics has not accepted. Tensions are further heightened as ORLFC chair Bill Quinn has stepped back amid legal issues tied to the dispute. This squabble is happening alongside plans for a £70m multi-sports complex at Boundary Park, which has received council support. It remains uncertain how the feud might impact this ambitious project, and both clubs are keeping quiet on future arrangements for ORLFC's return to their original grounds.
