Exciting plans are underway in Stockport with a new regeneration project set to transform the former Stockport Art College into a buzzing workspace and social hub named Cheers and Smith. Led by Cityheart, this refurbishment of the grade-II listed building will kick off this autumn and is expected to create jobs and foster local businesses.

This project is part of the wider Stopford Park development, a £120m initiative aiming to introduce 442 new homes next to the War Memorial Art Gallery, alongside an ‘Art Park’ and public spaces. The first apartments are anticipated to hit the market in 2026. Stockport's ambitious £1bn regeneration plan targets a total of 8,000 new homes in the town centre, with the aim of revitalising the area while preserving its heritage. 

Council leader Mark Roberts emphasised the importance of blending new developments with Stockport's historic charm. Cheers and Smith is viewed as a prime example of this ethos, aiming to create a vibrant community spot for entrepreneurs and locals alike. Overall, it's an exciting time for Stockport’s transformation!
