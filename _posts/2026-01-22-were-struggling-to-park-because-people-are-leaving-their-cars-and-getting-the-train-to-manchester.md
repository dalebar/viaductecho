Commuters parking for free on Gradwell Street in Edgeley, close to Stockport railway station, are creating headaches for local residents. They complain that the limited on-street parking is often taken up by those heading to Manchester or London. The nearby Harrisson Court, which has 73 apartments but only 16 parking spaces, is particularly affected. Residents there have started a petition to join the local parking permit scheme to ease their struggles. They argue the scheme could help alleviate issues caused by overloaded private parking and free parking used by commuters.

Councillor Grace Baynham acknowledged the parking pressures and said the situation would be reviewed, especially considering residents' mobility concerns. However, there are worries about whether there'll be enough spaces even if the scheme is expanded. Local residents noted that the influx of people and new flats could worsen the parking situation. There's a mix of hope and scepticism about potential solutions, with many feeling that encouraging public transport use will take time and that parking issues aren't going away anytime soon.
