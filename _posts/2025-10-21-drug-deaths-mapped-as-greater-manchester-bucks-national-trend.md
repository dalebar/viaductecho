In Greater Manchester, drug-related deaths hit 298 last year, marking a five-year low despite a national spike that saw England and Wales report 5,565 deaths, the highest ever recorded. Manchester had the most fatalities in the region, with a mortality rate of 15.3 per 100,000, nearly double the national average. The area ranks seventh in the North West for drug deaths, with Tameside, Bolton, Wigan, and Stockport following closely behind. Notably, deaths linked to the potent synthetic opioid nitazenes increased nearly four-fold across England and Wales, sparking concern among authorities. Chief Supt Joe Harrop warned that users might unknowingly consume these dangerous substances mixed with other drugs. The figures reveal that men are at a higher risk, particularly Generation X, with the average age of drug-related deaths being 45.5 for men and 48.5 for women. Calls for policy changes include harm-reduction measures like supervised consumption rooms and increased access to naloxone, a lifesaving overdose medication. The government acknowledges the crisis and is pushing initiatives to address drug-related risks and promote treatment, especially in deprived areas.
