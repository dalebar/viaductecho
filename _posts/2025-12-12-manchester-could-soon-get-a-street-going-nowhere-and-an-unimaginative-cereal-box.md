Next week, planning debates will continue over two contentious proposals—a 752-home development on Great Ancoats Street featuring 25 and 50-storey towers, and a redevelopment of Chorlton Cross shopping precinct with 262 flats. Critics have slammed the skyscrapers as "unimaginative cereal boxes," accusing developers of disregarding city frameworks and local concerns. Piccadilly Councillor Sam Wheeler expressed strong disapproval, highlighting that the plans exceed the approved height limits. Similarly, the Chorlton proposal faced fierce opposition from campaigners arguing it’s overly dense and more suitable for city centres than neighbourhoods. Both proposals were deferred last month for site visits and are up for discussion again on December 18, with council officers recommending approval. Other agenda items include a potential ban on retaining a marquee at the British Muslim Heritage Centre, plans for demolishing a garage for a community building in Crumpsall, and recreational developments at Wythenshawe Park.
