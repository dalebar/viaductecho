The plan for a mandatory national digital ID system, pushed by Kier Starmer, has sparked mixed reactions. While nearly three million have signed a petition against it, calling it a move towards mass surveillance, initial support was higher. Recent polls show a shift, with 31% in favour and 45% opposed. Starmer insists the ID will help combat illegal migration, stating itâ€™ll be essential for work in the UK by 2029. Public opinions in Manchester are varied; some, like John, worry about privacy and data access, while others, like David, view it as a necessary step in the digital age. Younger voices, like Mia and Darcy, see both pros and cons, emphasising how it might complicate access for those without technology. Safety of personal data is a huge concern among many residents, including Cynthia, who feels it's another intrusion into their lives. The government assures that the system will streamline interactions with services and be designed for security. A public consultation is forthcoming to address the widespread concerns.
