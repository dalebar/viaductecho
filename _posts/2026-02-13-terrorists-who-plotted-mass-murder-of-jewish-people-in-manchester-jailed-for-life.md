Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein, two convicted terrorists, have been sentenced to life imprisonment for plotting a mass murder attack on the Jewish community in Manchester, with a total minimum term of 63 years. They planned to use AK47s to attack a pro-Israel march in 2024 and then target Jewish areas. The pair was apprehended thanks to an undercover operative who posed as an ISIS supporter. During the trial, Saadaoui was found to have a history of anti-Semitic postings and glorified terrorist acts. The judge emphasised their intentions, saying the attack could have been one of the deadliest in UK history targeting the Jewish community. Saadaoui received a 37-year minimum, while Hussein must serve at least 26 years. Their lack of remorse was noted, with Saadaoui being described as the primary architect of the plot. A third defendant, Bilel Saadaoui, got six years for failing to disclose the terrorist plans. The operation showcased the police's commitment to counter-terrorism and community safety, underscoring the severity of the threat.
