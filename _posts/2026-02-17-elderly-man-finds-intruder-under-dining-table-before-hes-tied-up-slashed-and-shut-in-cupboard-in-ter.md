An 82-year-old man in Oldham experienced a horrific home invasion on February 15. The elderly chap discovered a burglar hiding under his dining table, who then attacked him with his own walking stick, tied him up, and locked him in a cupboard. The intruder slashed the man with a knife, stole his wallet, and forced him to reveal his bank card PIN before using the card at an ATM later that night. The victim managed to free himself and contacted his daughter, who called the police. He’s now being treated at Royal Oldham Hospital. 

This incident follows another burglary on February 10, where an elderly couple was targeted in Royton. Similarities in the attacks suggest they may be linked, and police believe the offender is deliberately targeting elderly residents through unlocked doors. Increased patrols are underway, and authorities are urging locals to keep their homes secure and look out for vulnerable neighbours. Detectives are determined to catch the suspect, described as a black male. If anyone has information, they are encouraged to reach out to the police.
