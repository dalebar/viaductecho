Briola, a new coffee and pastry shop, is set to open in Heaton Chapel on 10 January at the former Belcasa Concept site. Soreen Billbas, the founder, envisions it as a community hub for locals to relax and enjoy upscale, affordable eats. Following a successful trial run on 20 December, the menu focuses on high-quality, fresh offerings with natural ingredients, featuring hand-picked arabica coffee, focaccia sandwiches, and an array of pastries, including unique treats from the café's diverse team. There are plans for community events and classes in the future, with potential menu expansions based on customer feedback. Expect opening hours of 8am-4pm Tuesday to Friday, and 10am-4pm on weekends. You can check out Briola at 395 Manchester Rd, Stockport SK4 5B.
