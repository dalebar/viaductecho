Storm Goretti is causing chaos across the UK's transport network with roads and rail lines shut due to heavy snow and strong winds, leading to multiple weather warnings. British Airways has scrapped a bunch of flights at Heathrow, while Birmingham and East Midlands airports are also closed. Luckily, Greater Manchester is faring better, and Manchester Airport is mostly running on schedule. The airport has advised travellers to stay cautious and plan ahead, as more wintry weather is expected, potentially leading to delays and icy conditions. As of 8am, there are a few delayed flights, including several from Aer Lingus, Ryanair, and British Airways. Passengers are encouraged to check their flight status and stay updated on local traffic conditions.
