A senior medic in Manchester, Professor Matt Makin, has warned that the ongoing 'super flu' outbreak could spoil Christmas and New Year festivities as flu cases remain high in the region. Current NHS data shows an average of 159 hospital beds occupied by flu patients each day, a marked increase compared to previous years. The flu strain, known as flu A, causes severe symptoms that differ from a typical cold, leading to significant illness and potential complications. Makin stresses the importance of vaccinations, advising that about 40% of people eligible for free vaccines have taken them. He encourages everyone, especially those who don’t qualify for free vaccines, to consider getting vaccinated, as it could save their holiday plans. The flu's early spike is driven by a mutated strain, leading to unwellness that can keep people off work for days. Makin urges prompt action to avoid flu ruining seasonal celebrations, suggesting booking a flu vaccination at local pharmacies or through the NHS 111 app.
