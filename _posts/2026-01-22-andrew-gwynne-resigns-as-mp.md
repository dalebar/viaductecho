Andrew Gwynne has announced his resignation as the MP for Gorton and Denton, following nearly a year since the 'Trigger Me Timbers' WhatsApp scandal. Recognised for almost 30 years in local politics, he first served as a councillor before becoming an MP in 2005. Gwynne expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to represent his community and stated his wish for peace as he focuses on his health and family. He was a junior health minister under Keir Starmer but faced suspension and subsequent backlash after antisemitic remarks were leaked from the group chat. A by-election will be held soon to fill his seat. This vacancy has sparked speculation about Andy Burnham potentially contesting it, as he needs a parliamentary seat to run for Labour leader. However, he has not confirmed any intentions regarding this matter, emphasising his current commitment to his role as Greater Manchester's mayor.
