It's feeling a bit autumnal this week, with trees changing colour and folks sharing their seasonal home decor. This weekend is set to bring highs of 16 °C and some sun, though the Met Office warns of rain later on Saturday. Starting off cloudy, we can expect showers through the day, with heavier rain rolling in by the afternoon, all while feeling a bit nippy. It’ll drop to around 6 °C overnight. Sunday should be a bit brighter with sunny spells, though a few showers might pop up in the afternoon. Temperatures will remain around 16 °C, right on track for autumn. As we head into next week, expect more cloud and some drizzle on Tuesday and Wednesday, with breezy conditions but temperatures staying near average.
