Stockport Homes is set to kick off an independent investigation into fire safety issues raised last year, particularly concerning Hanover Towers. Residents expressed significant fear, prompting the Building Safety Regulator to issue a compliance order in October, highlighting Stockport Homes' failure to manage fire risks properly. The council is keen on rebuilding trust between residents and Stockport Homes, emphasizing the importance of transparency during the investigation. At a recent Housing Cabinet meeting, they discussed the new Development Plan, aiming to improve living conditions and align Stockport Homes with other council services. This plan includes commitments to affordable housing and enhanced support for homelessness, with an interim review planned for 2028/2029 to monitor progress. The council is dedicated to ensuring that past mistakes are not repeated and that residents' voices are heard.
