Mary Ainsworth was honoured at a charity ball in a heartwarming moment recognising her dedication to fostering advocacy. At 31, she has overcome a challenging upbringing, including going through foster care, to earn three degrees and establish a career in education. Originating from Bury, Mary entered the foster system as a child after losing her dad and has fond memories of her welcoming foster families. Her academic pursuits became a lifeline during challenging teenage years, leading her to become involved in beauty pageants and eventually reach the final stages of Miss Universe GB. At the charity gala, she received the Not In Vain award, which highlighted her commitment to amplifying the message about fostering and support for care leavers. Emphasising the need for more foster carers, she encourages people to engage, stating that fostering can change lives. Alastair Cope from Foster Wales also praised her as a role model for other young people with care experience. Through her journey, Mary exemplifies resilience and the power of community support.
