A new study, inspired by late Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding, is underway at The Christie cancer centre in Manchester, focusing on breast cancer prevention in young women. After Sarah's tragic passing from breast cancer in 2021, funds were raised in her memory to support vital research. The initiative, known as the Sarah Harding Breast Cancer Appeal, has been active for three years, aiding in breast cancer research alongside leading institutions. Dr Hannah Harrison, now appointed as the Sarah Harding Young Women's Breast Cancer Fellow, will lead this "world-first" study using human breast tissue to explore why some women respond to prevention drugs while others do not. The aim is to recruit 1,000 women aged 30-39, with 750 being without breast cancer. Early results are promising, with 53 women already screened. Sarah's former bandmates have expressed their support, highlighting the initiative as a beacon of hope for future generations. Donations to support the cause can be made online.
