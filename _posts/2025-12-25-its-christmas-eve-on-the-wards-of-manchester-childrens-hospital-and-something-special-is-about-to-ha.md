On Christmas Eve at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Father Christmas and his elf cheerfully visited children who couldn’t make it home for the holiday. As Santa hollered his festive greetings, the atmosphere transformed from quiet and anxious to joyful and vibrant. This lovely tradition, cherished by both staff and families, helps bring a glimpse of Christmas magic to children in hospital. Staff members, like Rachel Newall and Amal Ali, highlighted the emotional impact, noting how children’s faces lit up at Santa’s arrival. Gifts, generously donated by charities, were carefully sorted by age to make the experience personal. Even though no one wishes to be in hospital during Christmas, meeting Santa and receiving presents help make the situation a bit brighter. According to Stacey O'Neill, the joy of meeting Santa makes the challenging time more bearable for families. Malcolm Hurst, the elf, shared how rewarding it is to see the kids’ excitement, reminding everyone of how fortunate they are. Overall, the night is filled with warmth, laughter, and a sense of community, creating special moments for those who really need them.
