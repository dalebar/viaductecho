Salford has launched its first camera-enforced School Street outside Peel Hall Primary School to tackle traffic and parking issues during school drop-off and pick-up times. The zone, monitored by Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras, operates from 8.15am to 9am and 2.30pm to 3.45pm on school days. Initially, drivers entering the zone without proper exemptions will receive warning letters for six months before fines are imposed. Certain groups, such as residents and Blue Badge holders, are exempt.

Councillor Mike McCusker emphasised the importance of safe roads for children, indicating plans for more School Streets across Salford in partnership with TfGM. Community feedback has been positive, with residents calling for similar initiatives near other local schools. The initiative aims to reduce motor traffic, enhance safety for pedestrians, and encourage active lifestyles. There's a £1.3 million fund for expanding such schemes in Greater Manchester. Overall, this move looks set to make school runs safer and healthier for the kids of Salford!
