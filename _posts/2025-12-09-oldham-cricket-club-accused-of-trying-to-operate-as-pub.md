Shaw Cricket Club in Oldham has been granted permission to change its licensing terms despite local objections. The club, which acknowledges it previously breached its licensing conditions 'unknowingly', claims this new license is essential for its survival as a community-focused non-profit. Managers stress they're not aiming to become a pub, but need to sell alcohol to compete with wealthier clubs. However, residents are concerned about noise, parking issues, and the transformation of the club into a commercial venue, recalling a time when the relationship was much better. Complaints of late-night noise and parking struggles are prominent, with 27 letters of objection received, compared to only two of support. Still, some locals defend the club, appreciating its welcoming atmosphere and thriving junior cricket section. The new license allows activities from 11am to midnight, with outdoor music ending by 9pm on weekdays.
