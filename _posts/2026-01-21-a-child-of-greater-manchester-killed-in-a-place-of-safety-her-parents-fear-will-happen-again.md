John Meehan and Katie Wheeler, parents of nine-month-old Genevieve “Gigi” Meehan, who tragically died at Tiny Toes Day Nursery in May 2022, are pushing for urgent changes in nursery safety standards to prevent similar tragedies. Gigi was unlawfully killed by nursery worker Kate Roughley, who was sentenced to 14 years for her role. Concerned about the lack of clear statutory guidance, the couple has launched the Campaign for Gigi, advocating for measures like compulsory CCTV in nurseries, regular unannounced Ofsted inspections, and safe sleep training for staff.

After a visit to No. 10 Downing Street, where they outlined their proposals, they hosted a parliamentary drop-in attended by over 50 MPs to rally support. With the campaign gaining momentum, they are set to meet with the Early Years minister to discuss changes. The couple emphasises that child safety must be a government priority, expressing gratitude for the community's support as they strive to make sure Gigi's legacy drives meaningful improvements in nursery care.
