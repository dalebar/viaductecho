Heaton Lane car park is currently shut for demolition, which Stockport Council has planned since September. The multi-storey car park will be taken down to slab level, with existing electric vehicle chargers relocated elsewhere in Stockport town centre. The demolition is set to finish by 21 December 2025, and will involve removing floor slabs from the ground upwards. Contractor P.P. O'Connor is taking noise and dust into account during the work, with dust suppression systems installed to reduce pollution. They donâ€™t anticipate significant noise issues, but the site manager can reassess if it becomes too loud.
