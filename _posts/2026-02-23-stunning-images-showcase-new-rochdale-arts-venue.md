Heywood Civic is all set to reopen after a grand revamp, with stunning new features like a large glass front, a bar and café, plus extra changing areas for bigger shows. The performance space has been upgraded for better lighting and sound, while still honouring its rich cultural history with nods to past acts like Ken Dodd and Showaddywaddy. This renovation is part of an £8.5m investment in Heywood’s arts and culture, with an additional £20m planned over the next decade. Peine Square has already seen improvements thanks to this funding. The official opening is on February 27, with live music and tribute acts lined up. Local council members expressed excitement about the Civic’s transformation and its future role as a hub for the community. The anticipation is buzzing for what’s to come!
