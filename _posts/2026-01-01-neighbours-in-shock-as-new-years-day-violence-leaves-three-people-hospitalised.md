A close-knit community in Rhodes, Middleton, was shaken by violence outside the Carters Arms pub on New Year's Day. Around 1:30am, police arrived to find two men (one in his 20s and one in his 60s) and a woman in her 30s with serious injuries, all taken to hospital. A man in his 30s was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. The car park was cordoned off as officers investigated, with locals expressing shock over the incident, which reportedly started from an argument inside the pub. Witnesses saw forensic tents being set up, and there’s no indication that weapons were involved. Police are urging anyone with information to come forward, highlighting they want to hear from anyone who witnessed the events inside or outside the pub.
