There’s been some proper scuffles in Manchester city centre, sparked by a Britain First march. The Manchester Evening News saw protesters getting involved in fights at Piccadilly Gardens, and it spread to Bloom Street as the rally progressed. Britain First’s demonstration, which pushes for ‘remigration and mass deportations’, faced opposition from groups like Resist Britain First and Stand Up To Racism Manchester. Jeremy Corbyn even popped by to speak earlier in the day. To manage the situation, police have imposed a 10-hour dispersal order, allowing them to clear out areas to prevent trouble. Footage shows clashes between protesters and police, with the police moving in to control the crowd. So far, three people have been arrested for various offences, including assaulting emergency workers and breaking the dispersal order. It’s been a tense day in the city!
