The Rejoin the EU party has named Joseph O'Meachair as its candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election on February 26, following MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation. O'Meachair wants to highlight the harm caused by Brexit and rally voters to push for rejoining the EU. He expressed concerns over Britain's international standing and called for immediate action. Meanwhile, Labour's Andy Burnham was barred from running, with Angeliki Stogia stepping in as Labour's candidate. Other candidates include Matt Goodwin from Reform UK, Hannah Spencer from the Green Party, Charlotte Cadden from the Conservative Party, and Jackie Pearcey from the Liberal Democrats. The upcoming election offers a chance for the Gorton & Denton residents to voice their feelings about Brexit and its impacts.
