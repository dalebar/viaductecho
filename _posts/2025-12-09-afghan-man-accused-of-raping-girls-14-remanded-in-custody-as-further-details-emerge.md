Sultani Bakatash, a 28-year-old Afghan man, has been remanded in custody after being accused of raping two 14-year-old girls in Bolton. He faced court for the first time at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court, with proceedings translated into Dari. Bakatash, who has been in the UK for two years with his family, was arrested following a report of rape in Middle Hulton. He’s facing multiple charges, including sexual assault, all relating to incidents on December 6. The prosecution opposed bail, which the court denied, setting the next hearing for January 13, 2026, at Bolton Crown Court. Greater Manchester Police are supporting the victims while investigating the case, having determined no other suspects are involved. Chief Superintendent Helen Critchley emphasised the importance of supporting the girls and their families during this distressing time and urged the public to refrain from speculation as the legal process unfolds.
