Residents on Woodhouse Lane in Sale are fuming after their rubbish bins went unemptied for 25 days, causing issues, particularly for Terry Gould, who cares for his ill grandson. He reported having to make tip runs to manage the mess, worrying about the potential for foxes to scatter waste, including medical supplies. The grey bins, meant to be emptied every fortnight, were finally addressed after complaints drew attention. A spokesperson from the One Trafford Partnership blamed a system error for the missed collection, which was only resolved after community councillors intervened. They also noted that driver shortages contributed to ongoing missed collections. The local councillors expressed frustration over the inconsistent service, feeling it's not what residents should expect given increasing council tax. The issues are still being worked on, with plans to bring in more drivers to manage backlogs and prevent future dilemmas.
