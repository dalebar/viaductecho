Last Saturday, heavy rain brought back memories of the devastating floods from New Year's Day, leaving residents in Stockport's Meadow Mill and other areas anxious about future flooding. Amy Hayes, who was rescued during the floods, expressed that there's still no effective solution to prevent similar events, leading to a community WhatsApp group brimming with anxiety over rain forecasts. Many local residents, like Antonia Elford, experience a mix of practical concerns and PTSD-like feelings whenever rain starts pouring. The impact of the floods is still felt, with ongoing repairs and issues in homes and businesses. Some families, like Chad and Tia Meadows, have sold their homes to escape the burden of flood risk, while local business owners remain vigilant about the weather. Authorities, including the Environment Agency, are working on plans for flood defences, but some residents feel uncertain about when improvements will be made, with predictions stretching as far as 2028. The community is keen for quicker action to tackle the ongoing threat of flooding due to climate change.
