Hassan Mohammed, owner of two Texaco service stations in Walkden and Horwich, is cutting fuel prices this Sunday to help people facing the cost-of-living crisis. From 6am to 10pm, unleaded petrol will drop to £1.20.9 and diesel to £1.32.9 per litre, making it the cheapest fuel in the UK. Hassan, who previously reduced prices last year, wants to support the community, especially with the festive season approaching. He emphasises his commitment to fair wages for his 25 employees, acknowledging that many still struggle financially. This initiative, dubbed Black Fuel Day, aims to offer some relief and brighten the mood during tough times.
