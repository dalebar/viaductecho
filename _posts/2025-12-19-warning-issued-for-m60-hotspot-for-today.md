Traffic is set to hit a peak this Friday before Christmas, with an estimated 24.4 million cars anticipated on UK roads. The M60, particularly near the Trafford Centre, is flagged as a top spot for potential traffic jams. The AA predicts this Christmas getaway will be the busiest ever, with many drivers opting for local trips—65% plan to travel within 50 miles. The main reasons for travel include visiting family and friends, last-minute shopping, and work commitments. Expect congestion around retail areas and major motorway interchanges, with other high-risk locations including the M8, M5/M6, and sections of the M25. TomTom warns Saturday might see severe traffic as shoppers head to city centres. Last year's analysis found Edinburgh was the most congested city, followed by London and Manchester. To ease the situation, National Highways will lift over 90% of roadworks from Sunday until January 2, ensuring smoother travel during the festive period.
