Former boxing champ John Murray, 41, has been sentenced to three years in jail for violent attacks on two women during a parking dispute. Once a notable fighter in the sport, even sharing the ring with Anthony Crolla, he retired in 2014 due to injuries and later opened a gym, which he eventually had to close due to financial struggles. 

The incidents occurred in January and July 2023; in the first, he punched a woman who confronted him after he blocked her driveway, leaving her with a broken nose. Later, after a split from his former partner, he broke into her home and subjected her to physical assault, including strangulation and hitting. Both victims expressed feelings of insecurity and trauma from the attacks. 

Murray pleaded guilty to strangulation and assault charges, leading to a restraining order that prevents him from contacting his ex-partner for seven years. His boxing career spanned 33 wins and 3 losses, and his downfall has been attributed to the loss of purpose after his retirement.
