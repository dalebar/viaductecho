Police are looking for help after someone had their jewellery ripped off by a passing car in Stockport. The incident happened on Saturday 15 November between 5:40-5:45pm as the victim was walking towards Stockport Interchange. A blue vehicle, possibly a Ford, pulled up and snatched the jewellery before attempting to speed away up the A6 towards Hazel Grove but diverted towards Levenshulme due to traffic. The victim was wearing a black top, grey tracksuit bottoms, and a black rucksack with a gold chain. Greater Manchester Police urge anyone with information or dashcam footage to contact them on 101, quoting log 2535 of 15/11/2025.
