Police are probing a violent brawl that erupted between fans and players during a non-league match in Oldham on Saturday, October 18. The incident, captured on video, occurred in the 84th minute between Avro FC and Kidsgrove Athletic at Vestacare Stadium. Footage shows players entering the crowd, leading to chaos as fans attempted to intervene. Families watched on in shock, and thankfully, no arrests have been made yet. Greater Manchester Police confirmed they're looking into what sparked the fight, and both the Football Association and Northern Premier League are also investigating. 

Avro FC expressed their dismay over the actions of some individuals involved, especially given they were winning 6-0 at the time, with Kidsgrove having two players already sent off. Kidsgrove Athletic has stated they'll provide a full report and are committed to cooperating fully with the inquiry. Both clubs are awaiting the investigationâ€™s outcome before making any further comments.
