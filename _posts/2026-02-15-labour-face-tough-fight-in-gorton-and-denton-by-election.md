Keir Starmer's hold on Labour leadership is shaky, especially with crucial elections coming up in May. The spotlight is on the Gorton and Denton by-election at the end of this month, following the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne after controversy. Local councillor Angeliki Stogia, new Labour candidate, is keen to combat what she sees as division from Reform UK, despite Starmer's dwindling popularity. In contrast, Reform UK’s Matt Goodwin, a former professor, is gaining traction with concerns about Labour taking voters for granted. Gorton and Denton showcase stark social divides, with significant poverty against a backdrop of a diverse demographic, including many students. The Greens, under Hannah Spencer, aim to leverage local issues too, while Conservative Charlotte Cadden believes her local roots could turn the tide despite recent setbacks. As the candidates gear up for the campaign, the unpredictable outcome emphasizes the PM's wobbly position.
