Manchester council is feeling optimistic that the town hall refurbishment will wrap up by spring 2027, following approval for an extra £95m, pushing the total cost to nearly £525m. The project, which has faced numerous delays due to issues like the pandemic and even nesting birds, has stirred frustration among councillors. Deputy Council Leader Garry Bridges assured the public that this timeline feels reliable, contrasting past setbacks. He highlighted the significance of this restoration, describing it as the largest heritage project in years and essential for maintaining the town hall’s role. Despite confidence in the new budget, opposition members voiced concerns over the hefty increase and expressed skepticism about potential future funding requests. Critics, including Coun Astrid Johnson, emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility, given the city's pressing social challenges. Although there's no exact opening date yet, some tours of the building are planned before the full project is finished, along with a cultural programme upon completion.
