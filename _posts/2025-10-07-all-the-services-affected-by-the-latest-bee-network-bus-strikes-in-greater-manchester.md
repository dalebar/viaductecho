Bus drivers at Stagecoach and Metroline will strike this Friday, Saturday, and next Monday, causing major disruptions across Greater Manchester. Around 190 services will be cancelled, including various school buses, particularly in Tameside, Trafford, and Stockport. South Manchester and the city centre will also see service interruptions, while areas like Bolton, Bury, Salford, and Wigan are set to have normal bus services.

The strikes come amid ongoing pay disputes, with Unite's regional officer expressing openness to negotiations. Notably, First Bus recently called off a strike after a 20% pay deal. Transport for Greater Manchester encourages passengers to check service updates before travelling and allows for additional support.

If no negotiations settle the pay issues, more strikes are planned for October 18, 23, and 24. The full list of affected services has been released, so commuters should make sure to stay informed.
