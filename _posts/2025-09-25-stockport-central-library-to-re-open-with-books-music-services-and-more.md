Stockport's Central Library is set to re-open soon with a range of services including books, WiFi, and computers, plus a new home for Stockport Music Service. It closed on 12 May for essential maintenance and improvements, which are crucial for the buildingâ€™s preservation. Although it was initially expected to re-open in summer, there have been delays and no specific date has been announced yet. Keep an eye on Stockport Council's Libraries page for updates.
