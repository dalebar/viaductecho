Andy Burnham has addressed rising speculation about him possibly challenging Keir Starmer for the Labour Party leadership. Amid Labour's concerning opinion polls, he hinted at the need for a strong plan to revamp the party. In interviews, he revealed that Labour MPs approached him regarding succession over the summer but later clarified he’s focused on supporting the Prime Minister instead. Burnham emphasised his commitment to Greater Manchester and stressed the need for Labour to devise a solid strategy to beat Reform. He plans to keep a low profile at the upcoming party conference in Liverpool, aiming to avoid overshadowing the government’s messaging after recent leadership changes. There was also talk of a new railway line announcement, but it seems that will be postponed beyond the conference, which Burnham critiqued as not ideal.
