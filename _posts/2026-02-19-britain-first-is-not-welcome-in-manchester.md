Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, has strongly condemned the upcoming Britain First march, labelling the far-right group as a source of division and hatred. She asserted that such views have no place in Manchester, a city known for its tolerance and unity. Craig highlighted that Greater Manchester Police will ensure serious and robust policing during the demonstration to maintain public safety and limit disruption. She encouraged residents to come together to show that hate isn’t welcome and to celebrate the city's diversity. Moreover, the council is promoting a poster for locals to display, reinforcing the message of unity against hate. Overall, the focus is on keeping Manchester safe, open, and peaceful, while firmly standing against the division fostered by groups like Britain First.
