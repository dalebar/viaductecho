Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have arrested over 750 individuals in a winter crime crackdown, targeting issues like retail crime, anti-social behaviour, and violence against women. Since December, they've ramped up patrols and hosted community drop-in sessions to engage with residents. The initiative is particularly focused on the busy Christmas and New Year period, which tends to see a spike in crime due to increased social activities. Approximately a third of the arrests are linked to anti-social behaviour, with 140 for retail crime and 100 for serious violence. Assistant Chief Constable Matt Boyle praised the collaboration between local councils, businesses, and the community, highlighting the benefits of a united approach. Deputy Mayor Kate Green echoed this, emphasising safety as a top priority and the importance of visible policing at this time. The operation, supported by the UK Home Office, will continue through January.
