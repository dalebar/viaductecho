High Peak Comps, a local online prize draw company, is stepping up to run its own charity fundraiser by participating in the Great Manchester Run to support The Wellspring, a Stockport charity aiding the homeless. The team—Charlie, Callen, Alexander, and Lewis—aims to raise £1,000 and has already contributed £500 from company funds. They’ve previously helped The Wellspring by donating food for their kitchen and are excited about this new initiative. Janet Parish from The Wellspring expressed gratitude for their support, noting the fundraiser's direct impact on those facing homelessness. Charles Edwards, owner of High Peak Comps, encouraged donations, stating, "We're buzzing to raise loads of money." Donations can be made via JustGiving, and the company has a strong track record of supporting charitable causes, having donated over £120,000 last year. High Peak Comps holds prize draws nearly every day, and the community can find out more about their efforts and the charity via their social media and website.
