Living in the countryside is a dream for many, offering peace away from the urban hustle. A stunning barn conversion in the Greater Manchester countryside, near Stockport, is up for grabs at £950,000, making it this week's Property of the Week. Nestled at the end of a quiet lane, Lower Stirrup Barn boasts privacy with no immediate neighbours. Converted into a modern family home, it features a blend of contemporary style and original charm, like vaulted ceilings and exposed beams. The property, set on 0.2 acres, offers breathtaking countryside views from floor-to-ceiling windows.

Inside, a grand entrance leads to a striking vaulted hallway and a spacious living room with a log burner. The kitchen showcases high-quality finishes and bi-fold doors to the rear lawn. On the ground floor, there are two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a utility room. Upstairs, you'll find two more bedrooms, including a master with stunning views and an en-suite. The garden is perfect for entertaining, with a covered dining area and sun-soaked spaces all year round. This unique home is a rare find, so potential buyers should act fast!
