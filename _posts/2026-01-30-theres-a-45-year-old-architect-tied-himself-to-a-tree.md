Ken Moth and Frank Williams, members of the Manchester Victorian Society, were alerted by chainsaw noises while at their architecture practice and discovered plans to fell rare black poplar trees for a new block of flats. Knowing the trees were protected, Frank climbed a tree and tied himself up with a 'SAVE OUR TREES' placard, while Ken called the media for publicity. The protest gained attention, leading to a front-page story in the Manchester Evening News and ultimately saved the trees. This act, from February 15, 1978, was one of the first direct environmental protests in Manchester and marked the society's long history of successful campaigns. Founded in 1966, the Manchester branch has been crucial in preserving Victorian architecture, saving notable buildings like Liverpool Street Station and the ornate Parr’s Bank. As the city undergoes rapid development, Ken stresses the importance of maintaining Manchester's architectural heritage, highlighting its historical and cultural significance. The Manchester Victorian Society, now celebrating its 60th anniversary, continues to advocate for preservation and welcomes new members to support its mission.
