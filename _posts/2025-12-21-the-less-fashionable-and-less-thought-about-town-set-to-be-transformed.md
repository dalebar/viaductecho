Tim Heatley, co-founder of Capital & Centric, has unveiled a vision for revitalising overlooked areas in Greater Manchester, with a focus on town centre living. His company’s Farnworth Green development, featuring 97 fully-let homes, is lauded as a model for similar regeneration projects, following a new partnership with Homes England to invest £860M over the next decade, aiming to deliver around 2,500 homes. Heatley believes that areas like Tameside, Rochdale, and Bury could greatly benefit from this approach and highlights the increasing demand for suburban living with access to services and affordable rent. He points out the need to attract more customers to these towns alongside housing initiatives. Farnworth Green serves as a prime example, creating public spaces and welcoming both locals and newcomers to the region. Heatley stresses the importance of celebrating the diverse, international nature of Greater Manchester, hoping to retain residents who contribute to the local economy and foster community growth.
