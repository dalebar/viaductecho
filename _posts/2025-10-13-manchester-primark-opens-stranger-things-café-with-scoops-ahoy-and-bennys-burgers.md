Excitement is building for the final series of Stranger Things, and Primark in Manchester is adding to the buzz with its new themed café. Open since Monday at the Market Street store, this pop-up café offers a menu inspired by the show, featuring treats like Benny's Diner Burger, Surfer Boy Margherita Twist, and Totside Down tater tots. Sweet options include milkshakes and ice cream with a twist. The café’s décor immerses fans in the world of Hawkins, showcasing beloved characters and the menacing Demogorgon. It’s open daily, with varying hours throughout the week. The fifth season of Stranger Things drops on November 26, and since its debut in 2016, the series has captured hearts worldwide. Alongside the café, Primark has launched a full range of Stranger Things merchandise, from hoodies to tote bags. The cafés are also popping up in Glasgow and Birmingham, running until early January.
