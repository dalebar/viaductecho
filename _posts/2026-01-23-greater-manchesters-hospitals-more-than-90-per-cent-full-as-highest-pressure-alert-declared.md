Greater Manchester's hospitals are feeling the heat, with over 90% of beds occupied, hitting 94.6% on average recently—up from 93.9% the previous week. This is the highest occupancy this winter, with Stockport NHS Foundation Trust leading at 97.6%. Increased demand is attributed to seasonal illnesses, including a flu spike and rising norovirus cases, putting a strain on A&Es and resulting in longer wait times. Staff shortages due to winter bugs further complicate the situation, while delayed discharges plague the system, as patients ready to leave can’t find immediate care. NHS Greater Manchester officials are navigating these pressures by managing demand and expediting discharges but acknowledge the significant strain on resources. The region's hospitals have routinely exceeded comfortable levels, previously described as "very uncomfortable" beyond 85% capacity. Nationally, the NHS is also reporting the highest bed occupancy for mid-January since 2020, driven by norovirus and the impending cold snap.
