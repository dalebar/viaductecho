Bury council bosses have greenlit plans for three large-scale developments that could add 6,000 new homes in the borough, boosting housing by 10%. The projects are set for Elton Reservoir, Walshaw, and Simister & Bowlee, but first, they'll need public consultation and planning approval. The plans include new schools, a tram stop, and improvements to local roads and green spaces, ensuring developments cater to community needs rather than just developers.

The largest is at Elton Reservoir, where 3,250 homes are proposed, along with a primary school and community centres. Walshaw could see 1,250 homes, with 300 affordable options, plus a new primary school and green areas. Simister & Bowlee is in line for 1,550 homes and another school.

Concerns from locals include definitions of “affordable housing” and increased traffic, as many fear the new homes could overwhelm already busy roads. Council leader Eamon O’Brien hopes to address infrastructure issues through planned highway improvements. Residents can voice their opinions during a six-week consultation period.
