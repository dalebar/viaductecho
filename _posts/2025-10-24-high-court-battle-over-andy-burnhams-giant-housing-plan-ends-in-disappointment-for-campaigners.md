Campaigners are feeling let down after their legal challenge against the Greater Manchester housing plan, Places for Everyone (PfE), didn't go their way in court. They argued that the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) made legal errors by changing the criteria for green belt land during the plan's development. The High Court, however, sided with the GMCA and confirmed that their adjustments were lawful. The PfE plan, adopted 19 months back, aims to create jobs and homes while promoting sustainable growth in the region by 2039. Notably, Stockport council pulled out, leaving nine of the ten councils involved. The original proposal included 49 areas for green belt protection, but this was cut down significantly during inspections. Despite the court ruling against them, campaigners like Zoe Sherlock and lawyer Ricardo Gama expressed their belief that the case highlighted flaws in the process. The GMCA called the ruling a win, asserting that the plan is vital for addressing the housing crisis and supports essential development while protecting green spaces.
