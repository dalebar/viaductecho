Manchester Piccadilly train station has reopened after a nine-day closure for an £8 million upgrade. The work involved significant track and signalling improvements on platforms 1 to 12, aimed at replacing infrastructure from the 1980s to enhance reliability for the busy station, which handles around 400,000 trains annually. Network Rail shared footage of the first trains resuming service, thanking passengers for their patience. While the station is back in action, some follow-up work will still take place on March 1 and March 22. Bryan Paynter from Network Rail highlighted the importance of this upgrade for safe and reliable journeys, urging everyone to check ahead before travel. Hats off to the team who’ve braved the weather to get this done!
