Sir Stephen Watson reminisces about his teenage years in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, where he worked as a kitchen salesman in the vibrant rag trade scene of the late '80s. He notes how the area, once gritty but honest, has transformed into a hotspot for serious crime, especially drug trafficking and counterfeit goods, by the time he returned as Chief Constable in 2021. Sir Stephen launched Operation Vulcan to tackle these issues, resulting in over 1,000 tonnes of counterfeit goods and 216 shops being shut down. He views the operation as pivotal for neighbourhood policing. 

In other news, despite recent challenges, Manchester is set to celebrate Pride this summer with a new not-for-profit called Manchester Village Pride. Meanwhile, Mattie Goodvibes, a local content creator, has gained popularity for his uplifting street interactions. The weather is looking light and breezy, though some roads are facing closures due to ongoing work.
