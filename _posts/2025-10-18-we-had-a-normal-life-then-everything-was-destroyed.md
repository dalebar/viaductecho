Maria Dushuk, 43, moved from Ukraine to Manchester in February 2025 after losing her husband to the war. Once a teacher and cultural worker, she now volunteers at the Manchester Ukrainian Saturday School while seeking employment. Since Russia's invasion, over 280 Ukrainian children attend the school, reflecting a community eager to preserve their culture amidst the chaos back home. The school, vital for Ukrainian families, helps kids maintain their language and cultural ties.

Ukrainian refugee Olga Kurtianyk runs a small Saturday school in Rochdale, supporting local families and offering English lessons. Activist Vera Tymchyshyn highlights the ongoing impact of war, advocating for awareness and support for Ukrainian causes. 

Entrepreneurs Polina and Serge relocated their vintage football shop to Manchester, embracing their new life in the UK while still worrying for their families in Ukraine. They express gratitude for the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which helped them find safety. Maria remains hopeful for a return home when the conflict ends, though she's uncertain about her future in the UK. The resounding theme is the resilience and determination of the Ukrainian community in Manchester to adapt and thrive.
