Elaine Cole, a 76-year-old grandmother, reacted strongly to being insulted by MP Andrew Gwynne, who called her a "Duki hag" in a leaked Labour Party WhatsApp group. The scandal led to the suspension of Gwynne and others for offensive messages, including accusations of ant-Semitism and racism. After a public spat with Gwynne, where he labelled her a liar about her Labour voting history, Cole expressed frustration, saying he should have been expelled rather than just suspended. Despite no longer being in the constituency due to boundary changes, Cole is critical of both Labour and the Conservatives, believing they’ve failed the community. She thinks blocking Andy Burnham's bid for the by-election might actually benefit him, as many locals feel Labour is done for. If she could vote, she’d pick Reform, citing illegal immigration as her key concern. Cole feels it's time for a new political direction after a lifetime of voting Labour.
