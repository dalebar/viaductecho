This weekend in Stockport is a bit of a weather mix. Friday starts off with cloudy skies and morning rain, temperatures peaking at 8°C and dipping to around 5°C. Saturday and Sunday, however, have brighter spots with partly cloudy skies and a slight chance of sun. Temps will stay around 8°C, dropping to about 4°C on Sunday. It might feel brisk with increasing winds—up to 27 mph on Saturday and 29 mph on Sunday.

If you’re commuting on Friday, grab an umbrella and factor in extra travel time for potential delays. The wind could also impact public transport over the weekend, so keep an eye on updates. For those looking to head outdoors, Saturday and Sunday are your better bets; just remember to pack some layers and a windproof jacket for comfort while you enjoy a walk or an outdoor spot with shelter. Enjoy the mix!
