A yellow weather warning's been issued for much of Greater Manchester, kicking off today at 10am and lasting until midday tomorrow. Expect snow showers to spread inland across Wales and northwest England this afternoon and evening, with 1-3 cm of snow possible by Monday morning—potentially up to 8 cm in some spots. While the impact's expected to be low, forecasters advise there could be some travel disruption on roads and rail, plus icy patches on untreated surfaces. Temperatures will be pretty chilly, peaking at just 1C today and tomorrow, with the rest of the week staying cold, though a bit more varied with highs around 5C. Stay warm and safe out there!
