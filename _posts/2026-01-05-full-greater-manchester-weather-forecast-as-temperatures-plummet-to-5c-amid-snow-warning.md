Today in Greater Manchester, it’s chillier than a chilly thing, with temperatures dropping to -5C, but it’ll feel like -7C. After a night of frost, many woke up to snow and icy conditions, with a weather warning in place until midday. So, keep an eye on your travel plans; delays are likely on roads and public transport. Snow showers could also spread inland, bringing 1-3 cm of snow, and up to 8 cm in some higher spots. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber cold health alert due to the cold snap, urging folks to check in on vulnerable mates, especially those over 65 or with health issues, as these temperatures can really take a toll. Meanwhile, parts of northern Scotland are also under amber warnings for heavy snow, lasting until 10am. Stay warm out there!
