The Mayor of Greater Manchester is launching a 'safety in setting' initiative aimed at improving early years providers following the tragic death of Genevieve 'Gigi' Meehan in a nursery. Gigi's family is campaigning for changes in legislation to enhance nursery safety, including measures like mandatory CCTV, routine unannounced Ofsted inspections, and comprehensive safe sleep training for nursery staff. Their campaign, called Campaign for Gigi, is gaining momentum, with the Mayor, Andy Burnham, expressing his support. The family plans to deliver a letter to Downing Street urging immediate action and will host a drop-in session for MPs to engage with the campaign. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority is backing the proposal, highlighting the urgent need for systematic change given the increasing number of children in nurseries. The Manchester Evening News is also promoting the campaign, inviting the public to contact their local MPs to advocate for improved safety standards in nurseries.
