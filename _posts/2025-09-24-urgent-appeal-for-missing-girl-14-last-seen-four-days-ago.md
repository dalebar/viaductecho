An urgent appeal has been made for a missing teenager named Carla, who hasn't been seen for four days. Last spotted on Halliwell Road in Prestwich around 6pm on September 20, she is described as a black female, about 5ft 7ins tall with a medium build. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a grey hoodie, a white top, grey leggings, and brown furry slippers, and she likely had black trainers and a black Puma backpack. Greater Manchester Police are increasingly concerned for her wellbeing and have carried out extensive enquiries. They've shared her image and are urging anyone with information to contact them using the number provided.
