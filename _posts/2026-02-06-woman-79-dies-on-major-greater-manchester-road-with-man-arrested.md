A 79-year-old woman was tragically killed after being hit by a Volvo S90 on Bury New Road in Prestwich last night. The driver, a man in his 40s, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is in custody for questioning. Greater Manchester Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit has started an investigation into the incident. The scene was secured by police, with a forensic tent set up and a significant emergency response present. They’re appealing for witnesses, especially those with CCTV or dashcam footage from the area before the collision. Anyone with information can reach out to the police or, anonymously, to Crimestoppers.
