The Bird at Birtle, once a trendy gastropub run by celebrity chef Andrew Nutter, is set to become a nursery for kids up to five. After a £1m revamp in 2016, the Nutter family sold the pub last year for Andrew's mum to retire. Initially known as Bird i’th Hand, it had been derelict for years before the transformation. With Rochdale council's backing, Heaton Park View Nursery Limited will take over the site at Bury and Rochdale Old Road. They currently have an "outstanding" Ofsted rating and are expanding to meet rising childcare demand. No physical changes will be made to the building or car park, and the nursery will cater to up to 80 children, employing 10-12 staff. The nursery will operate Monday to Friday, 7.30am to 6.30pm, reducing activity significantly compared to the former restaurant's late hours. Additionally, the Nutter family once ran a renowned fine dining restaurant in Norden, which was sold in 2021 and has since remained empty.
