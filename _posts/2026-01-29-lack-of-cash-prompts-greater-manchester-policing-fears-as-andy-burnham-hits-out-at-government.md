Greater Manchester Police (GMP) is grappling with a £32 million budget shortfall, sparking concerns over the quality of local policing. Deputy Mayor Kate Green expressed doubts about maintaining service levels, despite a proposed £15 rise in council tax for policing. The funding crunch is partly due to a disappointing government settlement, which left GMP with one of the lowest increases among police forces in England and Wales. Mayor Andy Burnham emphasised the need to protect vital frontline services, but also noted the financial strain faced by the force, especially after incidents like the synagogue attack underscored increased policing pressures. Community protests arose during a meeting, with some residents arguing funds should be directed towards community initiatives rather than policing, highlighting a perceived lack of engagement about funding priorities. Despite the challenges, the financial plan was endorsed by the committee, aiming to enhance police presence in areas like Piccadilly Gardens, deemed a priority for public safety.
