The main railway line between Manchester and Sheffield will close for over 24 hours starting at 6pm today due to Storm Goretti, which is expected to bring heavy snowfall and strong winds across the UK. An amber weather warning is in place, with forecasts of up to 30cm of snow and gusts reaching 90mph, leading to potential power cuts and travel disruptions. Affected services, including East Midlands trains, will be cancelled, and no replacement bus service will be offered. Passengers can use their tickets earlier today or on the weekend. Other local routes, like those between Guide Bridge and Glossop, are also suspended. Avanti plans to run fewer trains on some routes after 3pm, and Transport for Wales warns of widespread disruption. Travellers are advised to journey earlier if possible, as delays and cancellations may occur.
