This weekend in Stockport, expect a mix of clouds and rain. Friday kicks off mild with temps around 18°C but turns damp, so don't forget your sturdy brolly! Strong winds of up to 33 mph will make it feel brisk. 

Saturday feels chillier, with highs only reaching 14°C and lows of 10°C, plus a solid chance of rain and even windier conditions at 37 mph. 

By Sunday, things might brighten up a bit—morning showers clear for partly cloudy skies with temps similar to Saturday. Winds will drop to about 26 mph as the day goes on.

If you’re commuting, allow extra time for travel and keep an eye on slippery roads. For those with weekend plans, it’s wise to stay flexible with indoor alternatives and keep waterproof gear handy. Enjoy your weekend, even if the weather tries to rain on your parade!
