The daughter of Salford crime figure Paul Massey believes her dad "deserves the truth" as an inquest into his 2015 murder is set to address important issues surrounding his death. Massey, shot by Mark Fellows with an Uzi outside his home, was a significant figure in the Salford gang scene, mentoring members of the A-Team. The inquest comes after a decade-long fight by Massey's family, seeking a comprehensive investigation into the police's failure to protect him before his murder. Coroner Timothy Brennand confirmed that the inquest would examine Greater Manchester Police's handling of a 'Threat to Life' warning given to Massey shortly before his death. His daughter Kelly expressed gratitude for the independent investigation, emphasising the family's need for answers. The inquest will not investigate the broader gang feud but will scrutinise police actions and the delivery of the warning. Previously, police found that Massey received multiple warnings, yet the manner of their delivery raised concerns. The full inquest begins on March 23, 2024, aiming to provide clarity and justice for Massey's family.
