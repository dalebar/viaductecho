In a tragic incident at the Crumpsall synagogue, two people were shot by police during an attempt to stop attacker Jihad Al-Shamie from entering. The victims, Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, were caught in crossfire behind the entrance door as worshippers bravely tried to prevent the attacker. Al-Shamie, armed with a non-viable device, was shot dead by armed officers. Greater Manchester Police's Chief Constable Stephen Watson confirmed that one of the deceased likely sustained a gunshot wound from police, who were trying to protect the community. Two men and a woman have been arrested, and further arrests are ongoing. One of the three injured individuals in hospital has a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. Police stated they are providing support to affected families and the community during this distressing time.
