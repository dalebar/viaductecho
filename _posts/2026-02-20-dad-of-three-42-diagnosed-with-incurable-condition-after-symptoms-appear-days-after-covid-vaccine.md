Jonathan Haigh, a 42-year-old dad from Urmston, is struggling with a debilitating skin condition called Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) that developed rapidly after his second Covid-19 vaccine dose. Living on £118-a-week in sick pay, he feels like a fraction of himself and has missed precious moments with his kids due to the severe pain and embarrassment from his condition. His attempt to enjoy a Manchester City match turned into a distressing experience, exacerbated by worries about how others perceived him. After seeking help from doctors, he finally received a PRP diagnosis through a private consultation. Despite applying for PIP support, he’s been denied assistance, with officials deeming him ineligible. Jonathan describes the treatments as trial meds without a true cure and mentions the negative impact on his mental health, leading him to isolate himself. His plea for better government support and acknowledgment of serious vaccine side effects has resonated with many, as his recent Facebook post reached over 800,000 people. He hopes his experience will prompt action from the authorities.
