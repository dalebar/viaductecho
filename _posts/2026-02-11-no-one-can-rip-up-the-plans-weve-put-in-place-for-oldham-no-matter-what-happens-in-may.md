Oldham's regeneration plans are full steam ahead, according to Coun Arooj Shah, Labour’s leader. Even if they lose power in the upcoming local elections, the council has £450m earmarked for projects like Muse’s new homes, the £70m SportsTown health and sports centre at Boundary Park, and the Eton Star Academy. Shah stated that these plans are well advanced, with contracts already signed, making them resilient to political changes. Although the borough has a history of unfulfilled promises, construction is finally starting on new developments. However, political instability raises concerns among private investors, especially with the Labour group losing its majority and facing leadership issues. Shah highlighted the division in Oldham, acknowledging that any move could be perceived as favouring one community over another. She urged for unity and used the meeting with investors to stress the administration's commitment to enhancing residents' lives through these regeneration efforts.
