Salford Mayor Paul Dennett has announced new safety measures for Clowes Park following an act of vandalism targeting a Holocaust memorial bench dedicated to Chaim Ferster. The bench was damaged earlier this month, prompting Mr Dennett to express his outrage during a council meeting. He plans to enhance safety in the park, including installing new lighting and CCTV, in response to broader safety concerns raised by residents. Councillor Andrew Walters, visibly moved by the incident, thanked the Mayor for his support, highlighting the distress it has caused within the community, especially for those with personal ties to the Holocaust. Mr Dennett affirmed the importance of combating anti-Semitism and ensuring the memorial bench is sensitively restored and returned to its place for reflection and remembrance. He also promised to work with Mr Ferster's family and the local Jewish community to address concerns and improve safety in Clowes Park.
