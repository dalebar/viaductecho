The Bee Network bus strike in Manchester has made getting around a bit of a nightmare, especially for those relying on buses, like in Worsley. At 7.30am, the area felt deserted as cars piled up and the M60 noise echoed. With only two train stations 40 minutes away on foot, many were stuck driving or wondering why bus services were limited. On a quest to travel from Worsley to Manchester Royal Infirmary without a bus, the author faced temptation as buses zipped by. Conversations with bus passengers revealed confusion over service availability. The journey turned into an adventure of walking, scooting, and cycling, which took over three hours and cost £12.12—well above the £5 daily bus pass. While it’s possible to avoid buses, the struggle highlights their importance for locals. Would the author recommend this bus-less trek again? Not really!
