A derelict bakery on Mellor Road, Cheadle Hulme, is set to be transformed into a tapas bar called "Dos Hermanos," after receiving the green light from Stockport Council. The revamped site will feature a mezzanine, a bar, and a two-bedroom flat above, just a couple of minutes from Cheadle Hulme railway station. This project is part of wider efforts to rejuvenate Stockport, with similar developments seen in Reddish and Hazel Grove. The building, originally constructed in 1900, is a locally-listed property, ensuring its historic character is preserved during renovations. Previous plans to demolish it for housing fell through after the developer went bust, but it was auctioned in 2023 to new local developers, Porter and Daughter. Notably, the new plans won't include off-street parking, encouraging visitors to use public transport. Work on the project is expected to start soon, aiming to breathe new life into this cherished local landmark.
