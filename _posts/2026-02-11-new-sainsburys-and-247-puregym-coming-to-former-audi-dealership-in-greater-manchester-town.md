The old Audi dealership in Gee Cross is set to transform into a Sainsbury’s and a PureGym, after its closure last March. The site will be divided, with Sainsbury’s on the west and PureGym on the east. Plans include a 72-space car park with EV charging points, a car wash bay, and delivery lockers. Tameside council’s planning panel gave the green light on February 11, though Coun Doreen Dickinson raised concerns about the gym being open 24/7. However, assurances were made to limit noise during late hours. The developers, Dransfield Properties Ltd, estimate the project will create around 40 jobs, doubling what the dealership offered. They believe this new facility will be a significant benefit to local residents, especially with new housing developments planned nearby. The development is slated to open in late Spring.
