A mural in Manchester city centre, created in 2018 by about 40 artists with experience of homelessness, has been painted over ahead of the BRIT Awards. The mural, named The Doodle on Ducie Street, was meant to symbolise overcoming life's challenges. It was part of an initiative by what is now known as Arts & Homelessness International. Critics, including Amanda Thompson from the charity Two Brews, slammed the decision to replace it with a new artwork for the awards, calling it “ridiculous” and highlighting the mural's significance to the community. The new mural, created by artist Hammo, features depictions of musicians as part of an art trail celebrating local talent before the BRITs event on February 28 at Co-Op Live. Street artist Joel Bergner expressed sadness over the removal, reminiscing about the connections and stories shared during the mural's creation. A spokesperson for the BRIT Awards defended the decision, stating they consulted with local partners to ensure proper permissions were obtained.
