A council worker, Richard Shaw, 47, has been labelled a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' after defrauding nearly £900,000 from Bolton council and vulnerable individuals' accounts. Employed in the finance protection team, Shaw misused his position by diverting funds meant for clients into his personal accounts instead of managing their benefit payments. His extravagant spending included two BMWs, a holiday home, and over £53,000 on 'third-party women.' An investigation by GMP's Economic and Cyber Crime Unit revealed that Shaw had been stealing funds from May 2015 to April 2023, transferring a total of £893,926. He reportedly siphoned money from both council accounts and the personal finances of those unable to manage their own. Shaw is now separated from his wife, into whose accounts some of the money also went.
