A 28-year-old woman from Lancashire has been arrested for allegedly making antisemitic comments during a protest in Manchester. This follows a recent commitment by Greater Manchester Police and the Metropolitan Police to crack down on inflammatory remarks at protests after attacks on the Jewish community in Sydney and Manchester. The protest, which took place on December 20, saw crowds gathering near Manchester Cathedral and then marching to St Peter's Square, where the alleged comments were made through a public address system. The woman is being held under the Crime and Disorder Act and the Public Order Act for causing distress with her remarks. Assistant Chief Constable Matt Boyle emphasised the importance of responsible speech, stating that words can have serious consequences, and urged the public to voice concerns to the police.
