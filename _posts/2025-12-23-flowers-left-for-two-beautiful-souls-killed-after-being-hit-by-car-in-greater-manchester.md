Tragedy struck in Bolton as two women, aged 57 and 59, lost their lives after being hit by a Volkswagen Polo on Monday morning. Emergency services arrived at the scene at the busy junction of Scout Road and others around 7.40am, but sadly, the women were pronounced dead at the spot. Floral tributes have been left, with heartfelt messages describing them as "two beautiful souls." The driver, a 19-year-old man, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Greater Manchester Police are investigating, and those with any information or relevant footage are encouraged to reach out to GMP or Crimestoppers.
