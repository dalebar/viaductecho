Alfonso "Fonzo" Buller, a beloved Manchester legend and great-uncle of the author, has sadly passed away at 65. Known for his vibrant spirit and passion for music, he was the brains behind MVITA, a soundsystem that popularised house and garage music in local pubs and underground raves. Fonzo contributed to notable events like Spike Island and performed at Glastonbury. Tributes from fans and friends, including Ian Brown and Liam Gallagher, highlight his impact on the Manchester music scene and his supportive nature. Fonzo, born to a Belizean immigrant and a Romany Gypsy, left a lasting impression on those he met, embodying a sense of community and joy. The author recalls personal memories and experiences shared with Fonzo, capturing his larger-than-life presence. His unique legacy is cherished not only by family but by many throughout the city. Though the grief is profound, the author finds comfort in celebrating Fonzo's spirit with the heartfelt words he often shared: “Divine and royal you are.”
