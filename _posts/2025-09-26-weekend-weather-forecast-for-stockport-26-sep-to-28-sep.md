This weekend in Stockport looks to be a mixed bag. Friday starts off nice and dry with some clouds, hitting a high of 16°C and dipping to 5°C at night. Saturday brings a shift, with lots of cloud cover and rain expected in the late afternoon. Highs will be around 15°C and lows near 11°C, plus winds of 17mph. Sunday starts wet but should clear up in the afternoon, reaching a high of 16°C and cooling down to 8°C.

If you’re commuting, Friday’s the best day with dry roads. Watch out for slippery conditions on Saturday and early Sunday, so give yourself extra travel time. For weekend plans, Friday's perfect for outdoor activities. Saturday morning is your best bet before the rain arrives, while Sunday afternoon looks good after the showers. Keep an eye on the weather updates just in case!
