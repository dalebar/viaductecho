The abandoned Turner Brothers factory in Rochdale, once the world's largest asbestos manufacturer, is now a hazardous wasteland, attracting daring 'urban explorers'. Known as 'Rochdale’s Chernobyl', the site has remained off-limits since its closure in the 1990s. Recently, Spodden Park Ltd opened the gates for a rare look inside, revealing a crumbling structure overshadowed by safety concerns, particularly regarding asbestos. Despite previous redevelopment attempts failing, the current owners, backed by remediation specialists, aim to make the area safe again. Though homes are expected in future plans, specifics aren't due until 2026. Meanwhile, trespassing has surged, with security facing over 100 incidents in just one month, prompting community safety discussions to deter thrill-seekers. Locals have fond memories of the factory, but skepticism about redevelopment lingers, fueled by the site's dark past. Spodden Park Ltd is committed to addressing safety issues and hopes to engage the community with upcoming consultations. With a history of redevelopment setbacks, there's a cautious optimism about this latest initiative to breathe new life into the site.
