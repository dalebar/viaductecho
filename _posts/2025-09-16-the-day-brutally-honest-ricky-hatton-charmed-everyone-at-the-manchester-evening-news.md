Ricky Hatton, the beloved ex-boxing champ, returned to the Manchester Evening News a year after announcing his retirement to chat openly with fans on October 23, 2013. Always honest and funny, he shared that he thinks about a comeback every day but feels he’s found closure after his last fight in 2012. He reminisced about his career while discussing his autobiography, highlighting both his triumphs and struggles with depression and relationships. He admitted that while he battles with his mental health, he’s learning to cope better, visiting a psychiatrist and avoiding harmful habits like excessive drinking. His warmth and approachability left a lasting impression, especially on journalist Andrew Stuart, who noted Hatton's genuine kindness. Tragically, Hatton was found dead at his home in Hyde, with police stating the death isn’t being treated as suspicious.
