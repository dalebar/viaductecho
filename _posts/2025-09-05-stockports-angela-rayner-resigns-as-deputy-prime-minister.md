Angela Rayner from Stockport has stepped down as deputy prime minister and housing secretary over an issue with stamp duty on her £800,000 second home in Hove. The 45-year-old also plans to resign as deputy leader of the Labour Party. An independent ethics investigation revealed she didn’t pay the correct stamp duty, which raised concerns given her government role. Sir Laurie Magnus, who led the inquiry, stated that although Rayner acted with integrity, her failure to pay the right amount and the scrutiny it attracted indicated a breach of conduct standards. Rayner expressed regret in her resignation letter, taking full responsibility for not seeking additional tax advice, stressing it was never her intention to underpay. She made a mark in politics as the first woman to represent the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency since becoming an MP in 2015.
