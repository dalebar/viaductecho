Angela Rayner from Stockport has stepped down as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after admitting she underpaid stamp duty on her Â£800,000 second home in Hove. It's also reported she's resigning as deputy leader of the Labour Party. An investigation led by ethics advisor Sir Laurie Magnus revealed she failed to meet the correct stamp duty rate, especially given her government role. He acknowledged her integrity but noted that her mistake didn't align with the highest conduct standards expected in her position. Rayner, the first woman to represent Ashton-under-Lyne since becoming an MP in 2015, expressed deep regret in her resignation letter, accepting full responsibility for not seeking further tax advice. She stressed her intention was always to pay the correct amount.
