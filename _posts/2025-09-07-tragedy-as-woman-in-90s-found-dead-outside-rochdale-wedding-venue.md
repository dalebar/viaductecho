A woman in her 90s was found deceased outside the Ashcroft venue on Market Street, Rochdale, on the morning of September 7. Emergency services, including the North West Ambulance Service and police, were called at 6.28am but sadly pronounced her dead at the scene. Her death isn't considered suspicious, and the case will be forwarded to the Coroner. The incident led to the cancellation of a scheduled event, with the venue posting a notice about it. Lancashire Police expressed condolences to the woman's family during this tough time.
