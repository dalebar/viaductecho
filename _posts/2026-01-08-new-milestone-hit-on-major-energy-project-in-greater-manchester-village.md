A major energy storage project in Rochdale has reached a key milestone with an agreement between National Grid and Root-Power for a new battery energy storage scheme. This 30-megawatt (MW) facility in Newhey will support thousands of homes and businesses during peak energy demand, helping to reduce price fluctuations and prevent blackouts. Essentially, these battery systems work like power banks, storing excess electricity for later use, thereby boosting the capacity for renewable sources like solar and wind. The project aligns with the government’s Clean Power 2030 reforms, enabling Root-Power to develop 13 battery storage facilities across the UK. Managing Director Neil Brooks highlighted that these grid agreements are crucial for their operational plans and will contribute significantly to the local economy while promoting a cleaner energy future. Root-Power, part of the YLEM Group, is committed to modernising the electricity network to better integrate renewable energy into the National Grid.
