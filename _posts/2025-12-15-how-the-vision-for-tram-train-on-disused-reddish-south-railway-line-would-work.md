Denton and Reddish South train stations, with just two weekly trains each, could see a revival as tram-trains might soon operate along their underused line. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) is pushing for tram-trains on this Victorian-era route, linking Manchester and Stockport. If this takes off, it could also include connections to Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Airport, significantly benefiting local residents. 

The Friends of Reddish South Station (FORSS) have been advocating for improved services for years and welcome the tram-train concept, fearing the line's potential closure without concrete plans. MP Andrew Gwynne noted the new transport options could create a circular route connecting various areas, enhancing accessibility across Greater Manchester. While initial plans are still in the concept phase, significant progress is expected on the Metrolink extension to Stockport, which might pave the way for implementing tram-trains. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham emphasised the importance of the Bee Network in driving local growth and improving transport links.
