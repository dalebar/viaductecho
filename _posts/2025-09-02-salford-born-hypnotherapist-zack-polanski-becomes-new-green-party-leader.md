Zack Polanski, a vegan London Assembly member from Salford, has clinched the Green Party leadership with his radical "eco-populist" agenda, beating established candidates Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. Known for energising grassroots supporters, Polanski's campaign boasted a social media hit with 1.5 million views. With a background as an actor and hypnotherapist, he switched to the Greens in 2017 due to their stance on refugee rights and was elected to the Assembly in 2021. His leadership bid faced criticism for polarising language and a controversial hypnotherapy incident from 2013, which he apologised for. Despite challenges, he promotes a bold vision aiming to attract disillusioned Labour voters, especially as the political landscape shifts. His win steers the Greens further left, suggesting an upcoming competitive dynamic with Labour and potential partnerships with groups like Jeremy Corbyn's.
