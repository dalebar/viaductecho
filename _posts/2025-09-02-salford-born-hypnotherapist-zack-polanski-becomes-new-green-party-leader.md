Zack Polanski has claimed victory in the Green Party leadership race with his fresh "eco-populist" agenda. The vegan London Assembly member, originally from Salford, outperformed more prominent candidates Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. Known for his energetic grassroots appeal, Polanski's candid communication style has gained him both support and criticism, with rivals labelling his approach as polarising. 

Polanski’s journey to politics was influenced by witnessing social injustices while studying in the US and his subsequent community work. Initially joining the Liberal Democrats in 2016, he switched to the Greens a year later, becoming an elected member of the London Assembly in 2021 and later deputy leader. His campaign, boosted by social media savvy, aimed to energise the Greens and attract progressive voters disenchanted with Labour under Sir Keir Starmer.

With his leftward push for the Greens, Polanski’s victory could reshape the political landscape, potentially drawing votes from Labour. He even hinted at possible alliances with Jeremy Corbyn's group, posing challenges for the current Labour leadership.
