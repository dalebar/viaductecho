Zack Polanski, a vegan London Assembly member from Salford, has clinched victory as the Green Party's new leader with his radical "eco-populist" agenda. He outperformed joint candidates Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, despite their greater profile. Polanski, who previously worked as an actor and hypnotherapist, gained traction for his strong communication skills and grassroots energy, even while facing criticism for his polarising rhetoric. His political journey began while studying drama in the USA, witnessing systemic injustices that ignited his activism. Originally a Liberal Democrat, he switched to the Greens in 2017 and was elected to the London Assembly in 2021. His leadership bid surprised many in the party, marked by a viral campaign video. Despite a scandal over a past hypnotherapy session, Polanskiâ€™s bold vision seeks to reposition the Greens to the left and attract progressive voters disillusioned with Labour. In his victory speech, he vowed to create a "political home" for these voters and hinted at potential alliances with figures like Jeremy Corbyn, signalling a new chapter for the Greens at a critical moment in UK politics.
