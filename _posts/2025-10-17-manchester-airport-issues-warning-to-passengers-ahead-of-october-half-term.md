Manchester Airport is wrapping up its Â£1.3 billion revamp, warning travellers to double-check their flight terminals as airlines shift from Terminals 1 and 3 to the newly extended and renovated Terminal 2. With the project set to finish early next year, airlines like Aer Lingus, Finnair, and Luxair have already made the move. The airport encourages passengers to confirm their terminal and offers assistance for changes via its website, with extra staff on hand during the transition.

After a bustling September with a 1.4% rise in passengers, October is anticipated to be busy as well. Popular destinations were Amsterdam, Dubai, Dublin, and Tenerife, with Orlando topping the long-haul charts. Managing Director Chris Woodroofe highlighted the excitement around the upgrades and the positive feedback on Terminal 2. Once the transformation is complete, Ryanair will be the only airline in Terminal 3, which is also set for its own multi-million pound enhancements. New routes to Islamabad and Delhi with Pakistan International Airlines and IndiGo, respectively, were recently announced, expanding Manchester's connection to India.
