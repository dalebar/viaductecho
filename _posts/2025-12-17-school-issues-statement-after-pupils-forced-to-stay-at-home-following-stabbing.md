A school in Bury had to close after a stabbing incident late on Tuesday night. Four individuals were arrested, including two 23-year-old men and two 16-year-old boys, following the attack that injured a 19-year-old man. Greater Manchester Police cordoned off Cecil Street for investigation purposes, impacting both Holy Trinity Primary School and St Marie's RC Primary. Holy Trinity was initially closed as a precaution, but later stayed shut for the rest of the day, though the school assured parents that no pupils or staff were at risk. The police confirmed the victim’s injuries are not life-threatening, and the school intends to resume normal operations on Thursday, December 18. GMP is actively investigating the stabbing.
