Voyeurism offences in Manchester have dramatically increased over the past decade, particularly linked to a disturbing trend of 'nightlife videos' featuring unsuspecting women recorded during nights out. Recently, one channel garnered over 300 million views for posting such unauthorized clips, often featuring intoxicated women in revealing outfits, leading to troubling misogynistic comments. Greater Manchester Police reported a 144% rise in voyeurism and exposure-related crimes in the city centre, with total offences almost doubling across the region in ten years. While filming people in public isn't illegal, authorities stress women should feel safe when out. Victims are encouraged to report incidents so investigations can be conducted. Police patrols are active in nightlife hotspots to ensure safety. Meanwhile, a man was arrested for voyeurism last year after related videos emerged, marking a notable intervention amid growing concerns. The Manchester Evening News continues to highlight this issue, working alongside law enforcement to address the troubling trend and protect individuals' privacy.
