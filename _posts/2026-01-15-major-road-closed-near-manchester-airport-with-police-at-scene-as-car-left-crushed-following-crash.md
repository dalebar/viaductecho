A major road near Manchester Airport was shut down on Wednesday evening due to a collision involving two vehicles at the Finney Lane and Styal Road junction. Emergency crews, including police, paramedics, and fire teams, responded around 5pm, finding a silver Toyota significantly damaged on a pedestrian island. Two people were treated for minor injuries at the scene. The road remained closed for about an hour while the area was cleared. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service sent three fire engines to assist, and they worked swiftly to ensure safety while the paramedics managed the casualties. Firefighters were on the scene for roughly 45 minutes.
