Temperatures have dropped dramatically across Greater Manchester, with many waking up to snow and severe frost. The Met Office has a weather warning for snow and ice in place until noon today (January 5). This has disrupted travel, particularly affecting rail and road services. Liverpool John Lennon Airport was temporarily closed for runway clearing, while Manchester Airport remains operational but advises passengers to allow extra time for their journeys due to weather-related disruptions.

Five flights from Manchester have been cancelled, three of which were heading to Amsterdam, as wintery conditions have also been affecting operations at Schiphol Airport. Other cancellations include flights to Belfast and Aberdeen. Passengers are encouraged to monitor flight statuses closely, as delays and changes can occur on short notice.
