The free travel trial for elderly and disabled people on Greater Manchester buses, which took place in August, has been extended to November. This trial allowed concessionary pass holders to travel any time before 9.30am, generating over 100,000 journeys. Many benefited, accessing work, social events, and medical appointments. After its success, a group of charities and organisations pushed for it to become permanent, leading to the second trial in the busier November period. Joe Troop from Trafford Foodbanks highlighted the positive impact of unrestricted travel, mentioning how vital it is for older and disabled individuals. Transport for Greater Manchester plans to gather more feedback to inform future decisions, while Andy Burnham has noted the trial's popularity. The goal is to make this change permanent, with the final decision expected by the end of 2025. Interested individuals can share their experiences with Joe Troop via email.
