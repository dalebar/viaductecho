The Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce has gone into administration but has quickly resurfaced under new ownership, saving 37 jobs in the process. Earlier warnings indicated that the chamber's events business, Chamber Space, was running unsustainable costs, especially post-pandemic. Now, the main operations have transitioned to a newly formed entity, ensuring continuity of vital support services for the business community. 

While the Chamber Space conference services will not return, the new organisation is committed to helping businesses navigate a challenging economic landscape. It promises seamless service delivery, focusing on core functions like business support, international trade, and policy influence. Clive Memmott, the previous chief executive, will step down as the new leadership team, including finance director Sarah Blatch, leads the organisation forward.

The new Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce 2025 expresses gratitude to all members and staff who have supported the chamber through this transition. The aim is clear: fostering sustainable growth and representing businesses effectively to decision-makers in the region.
