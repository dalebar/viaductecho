A woman, aged 50, has been arrested in Middleton after a disturbance with neighbours on Aspinall Street late Sunday evening. Greater Manchester Police responded just after 8:20pm to reports of the incident, and the woman was taken into custody on suspicion of making threats to kill. Emergency services, including paramedics and firefighters, were present at the scene, but thereâ€™s been no wider threat to the public. The police have since stood down the scene. The woman remains in custody as investigations continue.
