Greater Manchester taxi drivers can get a boost with a new £4.45 million fund to upgrade their older cars to meet emissions standards by 2026, but only if they’re registered locally. Andy Burnham announced this fund alongside an existing £8 million package for black cabs. Drivers can access either a £5,000 interest-free loan or a £1,000 grant to help with upgrades, but it’s targeted at those who are properly licensed in Greater Manchester. Burnham aims to tackle the “Wolverhampton problem,” where many private hire vehicles are licensed out of area but operate locally. He’s lobbying the government for stricter regulations against this practice. Plans are underway to centralise taxi licensing under Transport for Greater Manchester, reducing the number of licensing authorities significantly, which is hoped to limit out-of-area working. The mayor insists these changes should not just reduce the problem but aim to effectively end it.
