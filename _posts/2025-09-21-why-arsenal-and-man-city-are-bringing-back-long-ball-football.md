Hoofing the ball upfield used to be a tactic seen mainly in lower leagues, but that's changed with Pep Guardiola's evolving influence on team play. High pressing and coordinated tactics have made this approach more common and effective. Interesting to note, Arsenal's David Raya surprisingly delivered 42.1% of his passes as long, despite their ball-dominating style. Manchester City also employed more long passes from goal-kicks lately. Both teams play similarly, focusing on ball domination and quick pressing to regain possession. While Arsenal's strategy has allowed for more direct play this season, the Liverpool game presented a different challenge. Overall, Arsenal and City have crafted intricate attacking styles, even as the competition intensifies. The best managers adapt to these tactical trends, showing why they stand out.
