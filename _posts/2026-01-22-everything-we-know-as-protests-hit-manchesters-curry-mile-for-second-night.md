Manchester's Curry Mile has witnessed two nights of protests linked to the ongoing conflict in Syria, primarily between government forces and the Kurdish-led SDF. The demonstrations drew large crowds to Wilmslow Road, with the first night escalating into violence, resulting in scuffles, property damage, and items thrown at police.
