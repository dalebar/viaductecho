Residents of the College Bank tower blocks in Rochdale, known as the Seven Sisters, are determined to stay put despite their homes being labelled unsafe. The iconic structures, built in the 1960s, house over 700 flats.

Rochdale MP Paul Waugh shared his concern, noting that tenants have already been living in uncertainty for years.
