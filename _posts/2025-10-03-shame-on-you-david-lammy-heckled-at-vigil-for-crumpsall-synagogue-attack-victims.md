At a vigil for victims of the Crumpsall synagogue terror attack, the Deputy Prime Minister faced heckling from the crowd while David Lammy spoke. Shouts of "shame on you" and "you’ve allowed it to grow on the campuses" voiced the audience’s anger. Mr Lammy, expressing grief over the senseless Yom Kippur murders, highlighted national solidarity with the Jewish community and condemned terrorism. Amid the disruptions, he pleaded for reflection on plans for marches over the weekend. Mark Adlestone, chair of the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester, urged attendees to let Mr Lammy speak. A banner at the event demanded "No more words. We demand action." This marks the third visit by a government official following the tragedy, with Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also visiting the site.
