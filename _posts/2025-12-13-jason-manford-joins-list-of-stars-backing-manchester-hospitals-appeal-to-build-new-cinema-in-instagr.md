Jason Manford has thrown his support behind a charity appeal aiming to raise £1.1 million for a new cinema in Greater Manchester hospitals. In a heartfelt Instagram message, he urged locals to donate just £2 to help reach the goal by Christmas. The appeal, launched by Manchester Foundation Trust Charity, will fund a fully accessible MediCinema at the Oxford Road Campus, which includes the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary. The cinema will provide a much-needed escape for long-term patients and their families, allowing them to enjoy films together. Other celebrities like Wayne and Coleen Rooney, Mason Mount, and Sir Jimmy Anderson have also backed the cause. The campaign has raised £250,000 so far, with Manford stressing that small donations can make a difference. He emphasised the importance of community support, noting that even a small amount could create a magical experience for children stuck in hospital. To contribute, text CINEMA followed by your amount to 70580 or visit the charity’s website.
