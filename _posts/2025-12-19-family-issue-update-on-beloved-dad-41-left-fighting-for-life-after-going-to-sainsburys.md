Lewis Rimmer, a 41-year-old dad from Bromley Cross, is recovering in hospital after being critically injured when a Range Rover struck him outside Sainsbury's on October 27. He had stopped by for a lottery ticket while celebrating his daughter's birthday. The driver, a 56-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and remains on bail. Lewis has suffered serious injuries but is reportedly getting stronger, as his partner Sarah shares hopeful updates. A fundraiser for Lewis and his family, which includes two young daughters, has amassed over £111,000, highlighting community support during this tough time. Close friend Andy Tonge noted the incident has resonated with many, especially as it took place in a local spot frequented by families. Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses or anyone with video footage of the event to come forward.
