Sunday in Stockport looks a mixed bag with partly cloudy skies and a good chance of rain showers. You can expect temperatures to be quite mild, ranging from 14°C to a pleasant 20°C. With humidity around 73% and winds gusting up to 17 mph, it’ll feel a bit breezy. 

The day kicks off mild, but you’ll see some sunshine peeking through later on. Just be prepared for the occasional shower due to that 58% chance of rain. If you're commuting, best to have an umbrella or a light raincoat handy, especially since the wind might pose a challenge for taller vehicles. 

Dress in layers—something you can easily toss on or off depending on the weather—and bring along some waterproof gear for outdoor plans. Also, don't forget to keep hydrated and secure any lightweight items outside. Enjoy your day, whatever you get up to!
