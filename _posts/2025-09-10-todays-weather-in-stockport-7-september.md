On Sunday, Stockport's weather is looking a bit mixed, with partly cloudy skies and a good chance of rain. Expect temps to start at a mild 14°C and peak at around 20°C. Humidity will be pretty high at 73%, and there's a 58% chance of those pesky rain showers. Winds will be a brisk 17 mph, so it might feel a bit chillier. 

If you're commuting, it’s wise to pack a light raincoat or brolly since rain is on the cards, and drivers should keep an eye out for gusts that could affect handling, especially in taller vehicles. Dressing in layers is a smart move to stay comfy as temperatures fluctuate. Plus, waterproof gear will keep you cosy during any outdoor activities. With the humidity and wind, don’t forget to keep hydrated and secure any lightweight items outside!
