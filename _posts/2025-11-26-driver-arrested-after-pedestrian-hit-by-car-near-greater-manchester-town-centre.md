An elderly pedestrian was injured after being hit by a car near Bury town centre on November 25. The incident occurred on Haymarket Street at the junction with Angouleme Way, prompting police and paramedics to close the road temporarily. The man was taken to hospital but his injuries aren't believed to be life-threatening. Bury Council advised the public about the road closures and potential delays due to the collision. A man suspected of driving under the influence of drugs was arrested in connection with the incident and is being questioned. Following the situation, a delivery truck collected the vehicle involved, and the road has since reopened, although bus routes were diverted during the incident.
