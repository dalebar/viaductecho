A Manchester City fan, Matthew Delaney, has been slapped with a three-year Football Banning Order after attacking a rival fan following his team’s loss to Brighton last August. The incident occurred near Brighton’s Amex Stadium when Delaney, 19, confronted a 54-year-old man who was simply pushing his bike. Delaney verbally abused him before striking him on the face, leading to injuries. He pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm at Brighton Magistrates’ Court and will not be allowed to attend any Manchester City or England games in the UK for three years. Additional restrictions include bans on entering Manchester city centre on match days and being within three miles of any regulated international match in the UK. He has also been ordered to pay nearly £700 in fines and compensation. Sussex Police’s football officer condemned the assault, highlighting the importance of ensuring public safety during sporting events.
