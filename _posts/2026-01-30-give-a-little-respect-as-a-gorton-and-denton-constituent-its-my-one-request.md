Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor with big ambitions, saw a chance to step back into Parliament but was quickly knocked back by Labour’s NEC, who cited costs for a by-election. Locals are feeling frustrated that Burnham wasn't allowed to run, seeing it as Labour’s best shot against Reform. The political scene has turned sour, with Labour and Reform exchanging barbs—like Labour mocking Greens for a spelling blunder. Residents have made it clear they want a strong candidate and feel burnt by the drama. Despite Burnham’s absence, the upcoming by-election is gearing up to be fiercely contested, and constituents are hoping for some respect in the process, wanting normalcy in their daily lives without the political circus overshadowing their community.
