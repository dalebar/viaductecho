Regulars at the Queen Adelaide pub, where Hatton often shared laughs over a pint of Guinness, struggled to process the loss. His friend and landlord, Simon Boot, fondly remembered him as a humble, approachable four-time world champion who truly represented Hyde positively. Alison, Simonâ€™s wife, recalled Hatton's warmth, especially around their family, noting that he was someone who could just be himself.
