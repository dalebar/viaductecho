This morning at Manchester Airport, five flights have been cancelled, primarily to Amsterdam, due to wintry weather affecting the Netherlands. The impacted flights include Easyjet and KLM services scheduled for early today. Cancellations also extend to destinations like Belfast and Aberdeen. The Met Office has issued warnings for travel disruption due to snow and ice, predicting 1-3 cm of snow across northwest England and potentially 5-8 cm in some higher areas, particularly in Wales. They’ve cautioned that icy conditions could form widely, which adds to the weather woes. In the midst of all this, the Manchester Evening News is encouraging readers to stay updated with their weekly highlights.
