The government’s advisors are in Greater Manchester to study its impressive economic growth, averaging 3% per year over the last decade—double the UK average and outpacing London. Manchester has been chosen as the hub for the new Industrial Strategy Advisory Council, following Andy Burnham's announcement of the £1bn Good Growth Fund aimed at distributing wealth beyond the city centre. The council has partnered with the University of Manchester for insights to shape the UK’s industrial strategy. Dame Clare Barclay, council chair and former Microsoft UK CEO, highlighted Manchester's innovation and collaborative spirit as key to its success, indicating a desire to replicate this growth nationally. Both the council and university aim to enhance local growth, with a strong focus on improving living standards through job creation and investment. The partnership is seen as an opportunity to deepen connections within Manchester’s innovation ecosystem, ultimately benefiting the entire UK, as noted by Minister Blair McDougall.
