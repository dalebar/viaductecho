A coroner has found significant failings in the care of 22-year-old Cerys Lupton-Jones, a student nurse who died at a Greater Manchester mental health facility in May 2022. The coroner, Zak Golombeck, stated her death was 'contributed to by neglect' and described the situation leading up to it as a 'shambles'. Cerys was discovered unconscious after a ligature incident, which followed another similar event earlier that day. Concerns were raised about 'falsified' observation logs and inadequate staffing. The Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Trust admitted to failing Cerys and has since implemented numerous changes to improve patient safety, including a new hospital and enhanced observation processes. While her family welcomed the acknowledgment of neglect, they expressed their heartache over Cerys' passing. The trust has apologised, and the coronerâ€™s findings aim to prevent such tragedies from happening again.
