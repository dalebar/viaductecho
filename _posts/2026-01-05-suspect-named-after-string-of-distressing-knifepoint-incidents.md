A man has been charged after a series of alarming knifepoint incidents in Wythenshawe, south Manchester. Police were alerted to a man brandishing a knife and shouting on Friday morning, January 2. Allegedly, he robbed a woman at knifepoint and then attempted to steal a car before escaping in another vehicle with a victim on board. He reportedly broke into a house on Carloon Road shortly after. Armed police arrived at the scene, and Johnathan Windsor, 33, from Golborne, has now been charged with multiple offences, including robbery, attempted robbery, kidnap, and possession of a knife. He’s set to appear at Stockport Magistrates' Court today, January 5, and is currently in custody.
