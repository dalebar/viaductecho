Rochdale train station, nearly 200 years old, is set for a major facelift as part of a broader redevelopment in the area. Plans include a new 25m entrance canopy with greenery, improved underpass, pedestrian-friendly upgrades, and a revamped station square. Nearby, Mossley and Greenfield stations are also getting platform extensions under the Transpennine Route Upgrade to accommodate larger trains.

In Ramsbottom, a proposed one-way traffic system was scrapped after local opposition. Another project in north Manchester aims to build two high-rise blocks with 509 flats, set to change the Cheetham Hill skyline.

Meanwhile, there’s concern over affordable housing in Salford, with a developer opting out of building planned affordable homes due to financial issues.

Stockport’s MP highlighted the need for more affordable housing as locals struggle with rising rents. New developments in Stockport include apartments for rent-to-buy, with one site recently opened.

Additionally, roadworks are affecting several major routes within Greater Manchester, including long-term closures for rail bridge replacements and road upgrades.
