A teenage boy has been arrested in connection with a sexual assault reported at Plant Hill Park in Blackley, Greater Manchester, on December 15. He was taken into custody on Tuesday morning, and the police are continuing their investigation. A cordon was set up near the playground while specialist officers gathered initial evidence and spoke with the victim. Police are treating this as an isolated incident, reassuring the community that there’s no wider threat. Detective Superintendent Wesley Knights emphasised the importance of the victim's welfare and urged anyone with information to reach out, whether by calling 101 and quoting log 3478 of 15/12/25, or contacting Crimestoppers anonymously.
