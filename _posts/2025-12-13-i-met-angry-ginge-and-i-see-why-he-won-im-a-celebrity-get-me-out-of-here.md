On a frosty Saturday morning, Angry Ginge returned to coaching at Winton Wanderers FC after winning I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here. Hailing from Salford, he made history as the first social media star crowned King of the Jungle. Following his jungle adventure, he celebrated with his team’s win over rivals Little Lever at the Ginge Power Stadium. The 24-year-old was a hit with fans, taking time for autographs and selfies, showcasing his down-to-earth nature. When asked about being home, he expressed excitement and a longing for football. Despite the overwhelming fame after his win, he noted, "I don't think it'll ever sink in." He humorously mentioned missing the people from the jungle, though not the jungle itself. When asked about which was a bigger win—the match or his jungle title—he admitted it’s tough to choose, but right now, the jungle victory stands out until they clinch the league.
