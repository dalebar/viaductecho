GMP Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson has received a knighthood for his impressive work transforming the police force with a "back to basics" approach. After being honoured by the Princess Royal at St James' Palace, he expressed that the accolade reflects the hard work of thousands of officers under his leadership. With 37 years in policing, including stints at various constabularies, Sir Stephen took the reins of GMP amid challenges and has since led the force to significant improvements, making it a top performer. His no-nonsense approach has revitalised policing standards, emphasising professionalism and community respect. Under his command, GMP has seen major increases in arrests, stop-and-searches, and crime-solving rates, alongside a notable decline in overall crime. Additionally, Sir Stephen highlighted GMP's successful Operation Vulcan, which tackled organised crime in Cheetham Hill by shutting down numerous illegal shops. With his family by his side, he remains committed to showcasing the dedication of police officers, reinforcing that most are hardworking and compassionate individuals serving the public good.
