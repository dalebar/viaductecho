Cancer Research is set to close its charity shops in Hazel Grove and Stockport town centre by May 2026, part of a larger effort to shut down 200 shops nationwide. The charity cited inflation and shifts in consumer behaviour as reasons for the closures, stating that many shops were becoming unprofitable. A spokesperson assured that a leaner, more efficient retail operation would allow for more funding towards cancer research and improved service for all involved. While the decision comes with difficulty, they stressed it was made with careful thought and a commitment to support those impacted by the changes. After the closures, there will still be 320 Cancer Research shops open across the UK.
