Stockport’s weather on Saturday is looking pretty grey and wet. Expect overcast skies with a strong chance of rain all day, temperatures between 8°C and 11°C, and high humidity at around 87%. A brisk wind at 18 mph will make it feel chillier, so make sure to bundle up with warm layers and bring along your brolly.

Morning clouds will thicken throughout the day, so prepare for sustained wet conditions. Commuters should factor in potential delays due to the rain and slick roads—take it easy out there! And if you’re planning on heading out, waterproof gear is a must for staying comfy. Consider sticking to indoor plans to dodge the downpour and stay dry. Stay safe, folks!
