A predatory rapist, Kasir Bashir, is on the run after evading trial and has been sentenced to 29 years in absentia for the systematic abuse of two girls in Rochdale. Six other men have also received long prison sentences for their roles in the exploitation of the victims, now adults. The courageous testimony of the two women led to the convictions. Bashir, whose crimes involved grooming through connections with market trader Mohammed Zahid—jailed for 35 years—took advantage of the girls' vulnerabilities, subjecting them to horrific abuse in various locations. The victims shared their harrowing experiences, detailing how they were manipulated, assaulted, and made to feel powerless. Key figures in the abuse included taxi drivers who also exploited the girls. Despite enduring this trauma, both women displayed remarkable strength throughout the lengthy trial, which has finally brought some semblance of justice. Authorities are determined to find Bashir, and advocates emphasize the importance of supporting victims in similar situations. The case underscores the community's commitment to safeguarding children and holding offenders accountable.
