Rachel Reeves recently outlined her second budget since Labour's rise to power, aiming to alleviate the cost of living while raising £26bn through various tax increases. Key highlights include a £150 reduction in average household energy bills and the freezing of rail fares. The controversial two-child benefit cap has been lifted, which is expected to help lift 450,000 children out of poverty, a move praised by campaigners in Greater Manchester. Tax thresholds will remain frozen, which some argue could burden working individuals as wages rise. A new 'mansion tax' on high-value properties was announced, but local leaders worry the revenue will go directly to central government. 

Mayors, including Andy Burnham, have been granted the authority to introduce a tourist tax, with funding aimed at improving local public services. The budget also includes provisions for infrastructure and housing developments in Greater Manchester. While Reeves reaffirmed commitments to Northern Powerhouse Rail, detailed plans for the project remain unspecified despite earlier promises. Overall, the budget combines supportive measures amid pointed criticism regarding tax reforms affecting working families.
