A light aircraft crash in Greater Manchester involved a small Cirrus SR 20, carrying two people, near Littleborough. The incident occurred shortly after 11:00 GMT on farmland close to the M62, prompting a major emergency response including police, fire services, and an air ambulance. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a large yellow parachute, likely deployed from the aircraft, caught in a pylon. The air ambulance later transported a person to Salford Royal Hospital. The Air Accident Investigation Branch is on-site, working to gather evidence and understand the circumstances of the crash. Authorities are asking the public to avoid the area while investigations continue and to come forward with any relevant information.
