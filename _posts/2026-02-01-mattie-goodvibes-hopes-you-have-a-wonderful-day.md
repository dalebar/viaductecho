Mattie GoodVibes, a vibrant content creator from Cheadle Hulme, has taken Greater Manchester by storm. With his bright outfits and quirky sunglasses, he spreads positivity by showering compliments on random passers-by while filming their reactions. Formerly a TV producer known for working with Keith Lemon and producing popular shows, he pivoted to creating his own content after his dog’s illness reignited his passion for fun and creativity. With over 170,000 Instagram and TikTok followers and nine million YouTube views, his videos, especially his light-hearted supermarket tannoy announcements and public compliments, have resonated widely, garnering 130 million views last year alone.

Mattie’s videos capture the heart of smaller Manchester towns, where he finds genuine interactions and joy. He believes that making others smile also brings him happiness, describing himself as a "big Cheshire cat." Through his playful approach and community-focused content, Mattie's friendly antics are brightening the days of many across the region. You can catch him sharing his good vibes on various social media platforms.
