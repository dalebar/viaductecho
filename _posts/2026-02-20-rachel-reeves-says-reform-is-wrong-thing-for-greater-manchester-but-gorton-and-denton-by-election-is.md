Chancellor Rachel Reeves has described the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election as "too close to call," warning voters against backing Reform. In her chat with the Manchester Evening News, she emphasised the stark choice between Labour's Angeliki Stogia, who promotes unity, and Reform's divisive rhetoric. She expressed disappointment over Andy Burnham's blocked attempt to stand for Labour after Andrew Gwynne's resignation, stating it’s vital he remains as mayor. With polling day set for February 26, 2026, tensions have risen due to controversies, including police probes into Reform UK and Labour's claims of misleading tactics. The election features a mix of candidates from various parties, with Stogia facing off against Reform’s Matt Goodwin and others. Voters are gearing up for what promises to be a nail-biting election.
