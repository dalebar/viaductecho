**Saturday**: Things take a turn as the clouds roll in, bringing rain or even snow, with a high of 8°C and a low of 2°C. There's a full 100% chance of precipitation, so you’ll want to be prepared for wet conditions.

**Sunday**: More clouds and ongoing rain are on the cards, with temperatures hovering between 3°C and 7°C and a high humidity of 92%. Pack the raincoat!

**Commuting Tip**: Friday's chill might bite in the morning, but Saturday's weather could cause delays, so stay alert to local weather updates.
