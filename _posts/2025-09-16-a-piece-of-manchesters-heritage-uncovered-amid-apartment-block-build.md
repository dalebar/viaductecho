While building a new apartment block in Manchester, developer Capital&Centric has stumbled upon remnants of the 19th-century Dolphin Foundry. Located near Piccadilly station, this site revealed fascinating artefacts like wrought iron hooks from a rotary crane and remnants of casting pits and drainage systems, highlighting its industrial past. The Ferrous development plans include 107 apartments, a rooftop terrace, café-bar, and two green pocket parks, aiming to transform the area into a vibrant neighbourhood. This project is part of a broader effort to revitalise Piccadilly East, following previous ventures like Ducie Street Warehouse and Jenga Hotel. Construction should kick off later this year after archaeologists finish their work. John Moffat from Capital&Centric emphasised the significance of building on such historic ground, aiming to create not just homes, but lively community spaces.
