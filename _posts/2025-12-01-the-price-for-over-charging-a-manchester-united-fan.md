A Manchester United fan and his son got scammed by a Hackney taxi driver after travelling from Ireland to catch a game at Old Trafford. They took a taxi driven by Mandeep Singh, who didn’t turn on the meter. Instead of the expected £8 fare, Singh charged them £15. The father was taken aback but paid to keep their dinner reservation. Later, he reported the incident to Trafford Council, and Singh was found guilty in court of overcharging. The magistrates determined his fare was 92% higher than it should have been. Singh was fined £440, alongside costs. Cllr Rose Thompson from Trafford Council expressed satisfaction that the issue was reported, highlighting the importance of fair practices in local transport services.
