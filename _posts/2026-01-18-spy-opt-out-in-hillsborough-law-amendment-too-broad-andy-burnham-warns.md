Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, are urging the Government to reconsider an amendment related to the Hillsborough Law. They believe it provides security services with too broad an opt-out, which could undermine the law's intent. The amendment allows security heads to decide on disclosing information, leading to concerns it could obscure serious failures under the guise of national security. Both mayors have witnessed devastating events in their regions and are committed to transparency. They praised the government's progress on the Hillsborough Law but called for a revision to ensure accountability. Campaigners argue that the amendment gives intelligence chiefs unchecked power and that lawmakers should be the ones deciding on information relevancy. Notable incidents, such as the Manchester Arena bombing, highlighted the need for accountability. A government spokesperson assured that the legislation aims to hold authorities accountable while maintaining national security. The Hillsborough Law is designed to prevent state obfuscation following the tragic events of the 1989 Sheffield disaster.
