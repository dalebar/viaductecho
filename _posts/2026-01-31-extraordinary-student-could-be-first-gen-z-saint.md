Pedro Ballester, a Manchester student who passed away at 21 from cancer in 2018, is being considered for sainthood by the Catholic Church. His father described him as a young man who "lived an ordinary life in an extraordinary way." The Catholic organisation Opus Dei is advocating for his canonisation, noting that Pedro's story has inspired many across the globe. Church officials have interviewed over 60 people to determine if he led a life of "heroic virtue." 

Pedro touched many lives, including meeting Pope Francis while at the Christie cancer hospital, where he presented a card signed by fellow patients. His funeral drew over 500 attendees, including notable figures from the Vatican, and his grave has already attracted visitors. Opus Dei, which promotes Pedro's cause, aims for him to join saints like St Carlo Acutis, inspiring young people to seek faith and happiness. Pedro's legacy continues to resonate, with many seeing him as a friend and guide in their spiritual journeys.
