The funeral for boxing icon Ricky Hatton is set for Friday, October 10, following his passing at 46. Itâ€™ll be held at Manchester Cathedral at noon, with thousands expected to pay tribute. While the service is invitation-only, fans can line the streets during the nearly two-hour cortege journey from his Hyde home to the city centre. There are nine spots along the route for people to show their respects. In honour of Ricky, the Manchester Evening News and Daily Star are fundraising for mental health charities close to his heart, including Andy's Man Club and the Campaign Against Living Miserably. Additionally, the newly established Ricky Hatton Foundation aims to support those dealing with mental health issues, ensuring no one has to face such battles alone.
