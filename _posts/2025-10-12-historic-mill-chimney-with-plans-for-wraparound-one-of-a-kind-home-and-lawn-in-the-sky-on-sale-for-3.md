A historic mill chimney in Barrow Bridge, Bolton, is up for auction, starting at £300,000, with planning permission for a unique wraparound home partway up. This extraordinary project offers a contemporary two-storey residence of about 3,939 sqft, featuring three spacious bedrooms (easily adaptable to four), modern bathrooms, and a stunning open-plan living area on the first floor. Built in the early 19th century, the chimney stands as a testament to Bolton’s industrial past and overlooks the scenic wooded valley. The design includes a robust steel frame, glazed panels, and a private rooftop garden for breathtaking views of the West Pennine Moors and the Manchester skyline. It’s an incredible chance to blend history with modern living!
