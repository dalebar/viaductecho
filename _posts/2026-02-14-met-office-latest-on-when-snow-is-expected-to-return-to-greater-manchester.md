On Valentine's Day, Greater Manchester is enjoying a rare sunny spell, as a Met Office forecaster calls it 'the best day we've seen for some time.' But, don't get too comfy just yet – clouds are moving in, and a yellow weather warning for snow and ice kicks in at 9pm. This warning is set to last until 10am Sunday, affecting areas like north and east Manchester, Bolton, and Rochdale. Expect rain, sleet, and snow to roll in around 10pm, with heavier snow hitting regions like Bolton and Tameside by 1am. After a wet night, Sunday morning should be drier, though more heavy rain is on the way around 11.30am. So, hold onto your umbrellas, folks; it's about to get wintry again!
