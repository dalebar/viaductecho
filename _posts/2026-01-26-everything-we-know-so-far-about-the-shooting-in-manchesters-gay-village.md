Six men were arrested following a shooting in Manchester's Gay Village on January 24. Police responded to reports of a disturbance on Richmond Street around 5am, finding a man with a gunshot wound to his leg; thankfully, his injuries weren’t life-threatening. Armed officers located a firearm inside the property, and detectives believe the shooting was targeted. The six suspects, aged between 23 and 26, face charges related to affray and firearms offences. Authorities have stated the incident is not being classified as a hate crime and are actively investigating the motive behind it. A cordon was established on Richmond Street for forensic examination, with another scene secured on Princess Street where a Mercedes G-Class Wagon was present. Witnesses or anyone with information are encouraged to contact Greater Manchester Police.
