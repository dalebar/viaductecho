Bath secured their second consecutive win in the Premier League, triumphing 28-16 over Sale during a grim, rainy night at the Rec. With challenging weather conditions making the match even tougher, both teams had to adapt their play. England fly-half George Ford nailed a drop-goal after a previous penalty attempt hit the posts, pushing Bath ahead to 14-9. Bath's head of rugby, Johann van Graan, was pleased with the performance. The team's lineup featured De Glanville, Cokanasiga, Lawrence, Redpath, Arundell, Ojomoh, and Spencer (captain), among others, all contributing to the victory.
