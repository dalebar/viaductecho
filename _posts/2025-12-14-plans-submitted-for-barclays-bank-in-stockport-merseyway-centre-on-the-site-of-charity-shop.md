Plans have been put forward for a new Barclays banking hall in the Merseyway shopping centre, Stockport. The proposal involves transforming the YMCA shop on Arden Walk, complete with a modern interior, new signage, and a revamped shopfront. The bank aims to operate Monday to Saturday, from 9am to 5:30pm, and will feature an ATM outside, alongside various facilities like consulting offices and a waiting area inside. It will employ about eight full-time and five part-time staff. The timeline for opening hinges on planning approval, which Stockport Council is set to decide by 27 January 2026. There’s no word yet on the fate of Barclays' existing site on Bridge Street, which is just a short walk away. Stockport Nub News has reached out to Barclays for more details.
