Greater Manchester Police are urgently searching for Alistair “Alec,” who has been missing since 9 December. Last seen in Queens Gardens, Cheadle, he is about 5ft10in, with a medium build, blue eyes, and a bald head, wearing a light brown jacket with fur, a brown hoodie, blue jeans, and brown shoes. Officers are quite worried about his wellbeing and have been carrying out house-to-house inquiries and searches in local woodlands with trained dogs. Detective Inspector Craig Turner mentioned they've been working hard over the past month and have distributed leaflets featuring Alec’s image. They are appealing to the public for any information, urging anyone who might know something to call 101 and reference log number 1921 from 18th December.
