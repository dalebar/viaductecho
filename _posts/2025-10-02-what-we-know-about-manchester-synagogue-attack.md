The incident unfolded around 09:31 BST when a car targeted the public, and a security guard was reportedly stabbed. Greater Manchester Police confirmed the fatalities and mentioned that the alleged attacker was also believed to be dead after being shot by officers. Mayor Burnham stated that the immediate danger seems to have passed. The attack occurred on Yom Kippur, a significant day in the Jewish calendar when many congregate at synagogues.
