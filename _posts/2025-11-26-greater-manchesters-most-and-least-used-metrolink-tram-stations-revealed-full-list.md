Footfall data reveals Greater Manchester's busiest and quietest Metrolink tram stations. St Peter’s Square tops the list with nearly 4.5 million passengers in 2024, holding onto its spot from previous years. Deansgate-Castlefield and Piccadilly Gardens follow, with the former seeing 2.1 million users and the latter 1.7 million. On the flip side, Wythenshawe has the least-used stops, with Robinswood Road seeing only 23,850 visitors last year, followed by Crossacres and Peel Hall at 42,950 and 45,250 respectively. Overall, Metrolink is thriving, boasting 12 million more journeys between 2022 and 2024, with 45.6 million trips in 2023. This growth comes amid a campaign against fare dodging and an increase in penalty fares. Fran Wilkinson from TfGM noted that contactless payment is now the favoured method for travel, highlighting a significant rise in usage since it launched in 2019. Metrolink is making strides to enhance passenger confidence with more staff on the network to check tickets. You can look up your usual stop or see the station rankings in the full report
