Counter protestors gathered in Manchester city centre today to oppose a Britain First march promoting 'remigration'. Signs reading 'Refugees welcome' and 'Smash the Far Right' highlighted the counter protestors' views. The far-right group was set to assemble outside Piccadilly station at noon for their march. Multiple counter-protests, including Resist Britain First and Stand Up To Racism Manchester, started around 11.15am, with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking at the SUTR rally in Piccadilly Gardens at 11.30am. To maintain order, police implemented a 10-hour dispersal order, aimed at reducing potential anti-social behaviour and distress during the events. Photos show large crowds in Piccadilly Gardens with homemade signs like "Stop Racist Reform UK" and 'Migrants make our NHS'. Manchester council leader Bev Craig voiced that Britain First is not welcome in the city, promoting unity against hate. The protests coincide with ongoing travel disruptions at Manchester Piccadilly station due to a major overhaul, which won’t be completed until Sunday.
