Gangaa Govin is buzzing to reunite with her best mate Ibrahim, who’s flying in from Malaysia after three years apart. She’s settled in Oldham now, studying business and missing their chats, even if WhatsApp isn’t quite the same. Meanwhile, the arrivals hall at Manchester Airport on Christmas Eve is filled with excited families reuniting, bringing to mind scenes from "Love Actually." Imogen Storey and her family are welcoming Ruby back from Germany, while Giovanna Ryder can’t wait to see her mum Gail, who recently returned from Texas. Hamish Pratt, originally from New Zealand, is thrilled to see his brother and son, sharing the joys of a UK Christmas. Aimee Bentley is keeping a secret surprise for her best friend Lucy, who’s been away studying. It's all about love, friendship, and the heartwarming chaos of festive reunions at the airport.
