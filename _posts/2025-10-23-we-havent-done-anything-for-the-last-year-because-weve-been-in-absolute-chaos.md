In Salford, a debate has sparked over councillors taking parental leave and missing public meetings. Labour councillor Stuart Dickman hasn't attended since April due to shared parental leave, prompting concerns as councillors are expected to attend meetings or risk losing their positions. An extraordinary meeting was held on October 22 to discuss extending his leave, with independent councillor Andrew Walters questioning the fairness of the absence policy. He noted his own limited parental leave, suggesting alternatives like virtual meetings. Mayor Paul Dennett defended Dickman, mentioning his attendance at events during leave and confirming plans for his return in December. Councillor James Prady shared his regret over missing early family time due to work commitments. Ultimately, the council approved Dickman's absence until January 31, 2026, and Councillor David Lancaster's absence until May 31, 2026.
