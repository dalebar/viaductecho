Thursday in Stockport looks a bit grim with a mix of clouds and rain throughout the day. Temperatures will hover between 8°C and 11°C, feeling quite damp due to high humidity at 80%. Expect consistent rain showers with a 100% chance of precipitation, plus a brisk breeze reaching up to 23mph, making it feel cooler.

If you're commuting, be ready for wet conditions and potential delays, so plan for some extra time. As for the day itself, wearing a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear is a good idea. Just a heads up, managing an umbrella might be tricky in the wind, plus watch out for slippery spots. Stay dry, mate!
