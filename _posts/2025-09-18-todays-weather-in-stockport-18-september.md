Today in Stockport, expect a mixed bag with partly cloudy skies giving way to rain by late afternoon. Temperatures will range from a mild 12°C to a pleasant 20°C, but high humidity at 87% might make it feel a bit muggy. There’s a 52% chance of rain, so having an umbrella handy is a smart move. Winds could reach up to 23 mph, adding a chill to the air, especially later on. If you're commuting, factor in some extra travel time due to potential delays and slippery roads. For outdoor plans, it’s wise to secure any loose items and consider indoor activities for the later part of the day. Stay dry and enjoy!
