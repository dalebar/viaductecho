On 2 October, Yoni Finlay nervously prepared to lead Yom Kippur prayers at his synagogue for the first time. He felt an unsettling presence, later describing it as "radiating off" someone nearby. During the tense situation, he recalled hearing screams to "close the door" just before police arrived about seven minutes later. A stray bullet hit the synagogue, wounding Mr Finlay and fatally striking his friend Adrian Daulby, 53, who was helping to barricade the door with others. Despite the tragic events, Mr Finlay expressed no ill will towards the police and described his shock as not entirely surprising given the circumstances.
