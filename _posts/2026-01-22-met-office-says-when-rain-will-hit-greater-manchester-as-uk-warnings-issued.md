Greater Manchester is set for a rainy day with persistent showers expected, though the region should dodge the heaviest downpours affecting other parts of the UK. The Met Office has issued three yellow warnings and one amber warning for heavy rain, particularly impacting areas in the South West, Wales, Northern Ireland, and northern Scotland. Today, January 22, light rain will linger throughout the day, with heavier spells anticipated in Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, and Tameside around 11am and again between 1pm and 2pm. Expect highs of 9C and lows of 4C overnight. 

Looking ahead to Friday, there will be light rain until the early evening with slightly cooler temperatures, 8C and lows of 5C. The weekend appears mostly dry but cloudy, with Saturday offering sunny intervals, especially for Bolton, Salford, Trafford, and Wigan. Sunday’s weather will be overcast with a small chance of rain in the evening. Saturday could reach 9C and drop to 2C by Sunday night.
