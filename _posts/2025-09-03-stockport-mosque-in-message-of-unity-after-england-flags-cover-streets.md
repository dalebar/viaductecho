A mosque in Stockport has spread a message of unity following the appearance of St George’s cross flags on lampposts around the area. This is part of a national initiative called ‘operation raise the colours’. The Stockport Islamic Centre, located nearby, expressed support for the movement, with caretaker Ghulam Abbas stating he feels a sense of belonging after over 50 years in the UK. He emphasised that displaying the flag is a symbol of unity amidst division in the community. The growing wave of patriotism has seen England flags and Union Jacks popping up across Greater Manchester, including roundabouts painted with the St George’s colours. New resident Ejiro Chukwadi from Nigeria also welcomed the flags, appreciating the display of national pride. The movement has largely been allowed to continue unless it poses safety risks.
