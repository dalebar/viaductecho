Families impacted by the Manchester Arena bombing believe MI5 has let them down and should face more scrutiny. In a letter to the Prime Minister, they argue for MI5's inclusion in a new law to prevent cover-ups in public life. An inquiry revealed that the bombing, which killed 22 people in May 2017, could have been prevented if MI5 had acted on vital intelligence. The families expressed frustration, asking how many times MI5 needs to prove untrustworthy before action is taken. The proposed Hillsborough Law, backed by Sir Keir, aims to hold public officials accountable and ensure transparency following disasters, inspired by the Hillsborough tragedy that claimed 97 lives. Meanwhile, a judge has ruled that nearly £20 million will be paid to children injured in the bombing, with amounts varying based on severity of injuries, following extensive legal proceedings. Some victims sustained life-changing injuries and psychological trauma from the attack, which occurred during an Ariana Grande concert.
