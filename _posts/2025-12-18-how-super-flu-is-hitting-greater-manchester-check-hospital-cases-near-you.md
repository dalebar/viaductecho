Flu cases remain high in Greater Manchester, with an average of 159 hospital beds occupied by flu patients daily in the week ending December 14, although this is a slight drop from the previous week. The North West overall saw a 4% drop in flu hospitalisations, but other regions like southwest and East England are experiencing significant increases. NHS England warns that despite easing in some areas, hospitals are still under pressure due to a mix of winter viruses and doctors' strikes. Professor Meghana Pandit emphasised the importance of seeking NHS care, as we're not out of danger yet. This year's flu spike is mainly attributed to a mutated strain of the influenza A(H3N2), nicknamed 'super flu'. The Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust had the highest daily intake with 107 patients, while other local trusts reported fewer cases.
