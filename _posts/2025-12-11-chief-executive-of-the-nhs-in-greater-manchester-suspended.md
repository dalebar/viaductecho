Mark Fisher CBE, the chief executive of NHS Greater Manchester, has been suspended pending an internal investigation. His suspension was confirmed by the NHS on December 11, with no specific reasons disclosed. The interim leadership is being handled by deputy chief executive Colin Scales. Fisher, who was set to retire in March after 42 years in various senior roles, including significant positions in government and civil service, was appointed chief executive when the Greater Manchester Integrated Care Board was established in 2022. The NHS emphasized that the suspension is precautionary, in line with their whistleblowing, HR, and governance processes, and urged against assumptions as no findings have been made yet. They’ve stated that confidentiality prevents further comments at this stage.
