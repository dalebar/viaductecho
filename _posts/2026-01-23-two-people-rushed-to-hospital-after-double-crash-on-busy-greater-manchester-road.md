Part of Queensway in Rochdale was sealed off by police following two collisions within an hour on January 23. First, a crash involving two vehicles around 6pm resulted in a child being taken to hospital with back injuries. Shortly after, at 7.05pm, officers responded to reports of a man hit by a car, who was also taken to hospital, but thankfully, his injuries aren't life-threatening or life-changing. The police cordoned off the area near the junction with Oldham Road while emergency services, including multiple GMP cars and an ambulance, were on the scene. A damaged Vauxhall Corsa was spotted, likely linked to the second incident.
