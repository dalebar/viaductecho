A man from Bramhall has been arrested on suspicion of being a loan shark after an investigation by the Illegal Money Lending Team (IMLT) on 21 January. Working with Greater Manchester Police, they executed a warrant at his home and also searched a business in nearby Disley. He’s now in custody for questioning. The IMLT collaborates with Trading Standards in Stockport and Cheshire to combat illegal lenders, highlighting their harmful impact on vulnerable individuals. Dave Benbow from the IMLT emphasised their commitment to tackling illegal lending across England, urging anyone targeted to seek help confidentially. Common signs of illegal lending include holding onto important documents and using intimidation. It’s estimated that a million people in England are in debt to loan sharks.
