Over the week of 17-23 November, Greater Manchester saw a significant knife surrender under Operation Sceptre, with 368 knives dropped into amnesty bins. The initiative aimed to combat knife crime alongside educational efforts by Greater Manchester Police (GMP), which also conducted undercover test purchases to ensure retailers weren't selling to underage individuals—most passed the test. In total, officers seized 63 knives and made 116 arrests during this period. Superintendent Richard Thompson highlighted GMP's commitment to tackling knife crime, focusing not only on arrests but also on educating retailers about proper knife display and security measures. Deputy Mayor Kate Green praised GMP's proactive approach, emphasizing the importance of community engagement in preventing young people from carrying knives and addressing underlying issues.
