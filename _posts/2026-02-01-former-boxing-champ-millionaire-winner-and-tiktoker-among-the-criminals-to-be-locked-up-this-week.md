This week, several high-profile criminals were sentenced in Manchester. Former boxing champ John Murray, 41, was jailed for three years after assaulting two women during a parking dispute. He had a notable boxing career before his retirement in 2014 due to injury.

John Eric Spiby, an 80-year-old millionaire lottery winner, was sentenced to 16 years and 6 months for running a sophisticated drugs lab in Wigan, producing fake prescription pills that caused significant harm. His son and an associate also received lengthy sentences for their roles in the conspiracy.

Liam Dooney, 53, ran a scam involving cloned companies to illegally store and distribute over £500,000 worth of poultry. He was jailed for two and a half years.

Jennifer O'Brien, a TikToker, received a 17-year sentence for multiple rapes and assaults against a woman, despite denying the charges.

Additionally, Janzib Rigby, 30, was sentenced to eight years for kidnapping and torturing a woman over a debt, along with several accomplices receiving varying sentences.
