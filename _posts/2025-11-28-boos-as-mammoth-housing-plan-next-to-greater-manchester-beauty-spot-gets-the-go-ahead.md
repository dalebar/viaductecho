Bloor Homes has gained approval to build 309 homes on former green belt land in Littleborough, even though locals are fiercely opposed. The plan also includes a new primary school and an extended car park, situated near popular Hollingworth Lake. Over 1,000 objections were sent to Rochdale Council, primarily due to concerns about traffic congestion, pollution, and the pressure on local health services. 

Despite the pushback, Bloor Homes maintains they’re supplying desperately needed housing, with promises of road improvements and a £970,000 investment in local infrastructure. Local councillors expressed frustration that the development prioritises profit over community needs and highlighted issues like oversubscribed secondary schools. 

Many residents, including those living nearby, fear their peaceful environment will be overwhelmed by new traffic and noise. The planning committee, faced with widespread discontent at the meeting, ultimately granted permission, citing the development's alignment with broader regional housing strategies. The project continues to stir debate, with many wondering if the necessary facilities and infrastructure can truly keep pace with the influx of new homes.
