King Charles met survivors of a tragic car and knife attack at a Manchester synagogue, where two men lost their lives. Despite the dreary weather, around 150 people gathered outside to catch a glimpse of him. Dressed in a kippah to honour Jewish identity, the King spoke with the three survivors, including Bernard Agyemang, who was injured in the attack and arrived in a wheelchair. The synagogue had just reopened for the first time since the incident, celebrating Jewish festivals. Superintendent Kirsten Buggy expressed it was a "privilege" to meet the King, while Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson thanked him for recognising the hard work of emergency services in the wake of the attack.
