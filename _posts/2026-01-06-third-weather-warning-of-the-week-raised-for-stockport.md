Stockport's got its third weather warning of the year from the Met Office, this time for ice. It's effective from midnight tonight until 10am on Wednesday morning (January 7). The warning highlights that icy patches overnight could cause a bit of disruption, especially on untreated roads, pavements, and cycle paths. It’s a similar situation across most of Great Britain. After some rain clears out, clear skies are expected, leading to those pesky icy patches on wet surfaces. Just a heads-up: be careful out there, especially Wednesday morning! This follows previous warnings earlier in the week for snow and ice.
