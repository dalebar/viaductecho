Two drivers were taken to hospital following a crash on Ladbrooke Road, Tameside, on Sunday evening. Emergency services, including police, firefighters, and paramedics, arrived at the scene around 6:30pm to find two badly damaged cars, one in the road near a roundabout and the other in a garden after crashing through a hedge. Thankfully, the injuries of the drivers were not serious. The road was cordoned off for investigations, and residents reported hearing a police helicopter following the incident. The firefighters from Stalybridge Community Fire Station attended and worked alongside police for about an hour to secure the area. Further details are yet to be released.
