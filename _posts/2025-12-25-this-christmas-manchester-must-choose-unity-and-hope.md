This Christmas, as we celebrate with family and friends, we’re reminded that true spirit lies in community. Despite recent dark events, like the synagogue attack on Yom Kippur and anti-Islamic graffiti, Manchester shows incredible resilience. We’ve seen a rise in divisive rhetoric, but Mancunians of all backgrounds are coming together, pushing compassion over hatred. Rabbi Dovid Lewis and Imam Dr Nasser Kurdy are leading the way, teaching kids about unity in diversity. On a brighter note, the joyous return of Oasis and the introduction of Awaab's Law—ensuring better protections for tenants—have filled 2023 with hope. As we reflect on the year, let's focus on what unites us and strive for a stronger, prouder Manchester. From all of us at the Manchester Evening News, we wish you peace, hope, and a very Merry Christmas!
