Emergency services have cordoned off part of Salford Quays after a body was sadly retrieved from the water near the Salford Watersports Centre. This happened around lunchtime on December 5, with multiple Greater Manchester Police vehicles, fire engines, and ambulances responding to the scene. A police spokesperson has confirmed the recovery, but formal identification is pending. No details about the individual or the incident have been released yet. The Quays road is closed in both directions, and a blue forensic tent has been set up at the location, with officers maintaining the cordon. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service has assisted the police during the operation.
