Green Party leader Zack Polanski has announced Hannah Spencer as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton MP seat in the upcoming by-election. Speaking at a packed community centre event, Spencer, a plumber, highlighted her hands-on experience with the struggles faced by people in their homes. Polanski emphasized the competitive nature of the race, framing it as a contest between the Green and Reform parties, while taking aim at Reform’s Matt Goodwin. He noted that Labour’s dominance might wane, suggesting they’ve taken voters for granted. Spencer, a Trafford councillor, aims to address inequality and improve representation for working people in Parliament. She advocates for accountability from the Greater Manchester mayor and stresses the need for diverse voices in political decision-making, especially following the pandemic. Spencer's local roots and experiences are positioned as key strengths against traditional party politics.
