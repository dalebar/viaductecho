A man was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation and minor burns following a house fire in Bolton. The incident occurred around 10:45 am on February 22 at a terraced property on Hilden Street, prompting a swift response from three fire engines. Fire crews battled the blaze for about three hours, managing to extinguish the flames while dealing with severe damage to the property.
