Altrincham's historic Clock Tower, dating back to the 1880s, is set for restoration to resume its ticking after being stopped due to power supply issues. The Grade II listed structure, linked to Altrincham Station, has been in need of repairs since October last year, with Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) working on it. A new motor, expected to be fitted in early February, is part of a £6,000 repair plan covered by TfGM’s maintenance budget. Residents have taken to social media, reminiscing about the clock’s significance as a community landmark, sharing memories of meeting friends and even a cheeky climb by one local after a night out. TfGM assured that they are on track to restore the clock to its former glory soon.
