A group of survivors, including a woman from Oldham, have expressed support for safeguarding minister Jess Phillips amid calls for her resignation connected to the troubled grooming gangs inquiry. The inquiry's progress has been hampered by the departure of its chair candidates and five women from the victims liaison panel. Four of those who left would reconsider if Phillips steps down, while five others pledged to stay only if she remains in her role. They believe maintaining her position is crucial for consistency during the inquiry. The survivors also stressed that the inquiry's scope should extend beyond grooming gangs to include those who don't fit existing stereotypes. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer and other ministers have backed Phillips. The search for a new chair is ongoing, as former candidates have withdrawn. The government aims to engage with survivors to better address their concerns and preferences in the appointment process, while Baroness Louise Casey will assist in finding new candidates. Concerns have been raised about the treatment of survivors throughout this process, with calls for greater respect and transparency.
