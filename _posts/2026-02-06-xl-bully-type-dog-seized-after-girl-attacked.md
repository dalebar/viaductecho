A 10-year-old girl named Mina Bestun is in hospital with serious injuries after being attacked by a dog in Bolton. The incident occurred on Roseneath Road, prompting police to seize two dogs, one identified as an "XL bully type" and the other as a terrier. A man, 28, and a woman, 52, were arrested for possessing a dangerously out of control dog. Mina's father, Bestun Ibrahim, stated she is lucky to be alive and urged dog owners to supervise their pets to prevent similar incidents. The police haven't confirmed whether the dogs will be destroyed.
