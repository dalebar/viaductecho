Bikers in Stockport recently spread festive cheer by delivering over £17,000 worth of presents to disabled young people and adults through Roughley’s annual 'Toy Run'. On 7 December, hundreds of riders, decked out in holiday gear, set off from Stockport Tesco to the Together Trust charity in Cheadle. They brought along 3,199 toys valued at nearly £15,800 and made cash donations of over £1,250, marking an impressive increase compared to last year. This year’s event was especially memorable as it celebrated 25 years of support from the bikers. Lottie Jordan from the Together Trust expressed her gratitude, highlighting the bikers' kindness and generosity, which made a significant difference to the charity's Christmas appeal. The team was overwhelmed by the bikers’ contributions, marking the milestone in style!
