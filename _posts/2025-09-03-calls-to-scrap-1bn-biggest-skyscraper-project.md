A property developer's £1bn proposal for Greater Manchester, which includes plans for the region's tallest skyscraper, is facing calls to be scrapped. The project features 10 tower blocks, with the tallest reaching about 895ft (273m) and 78 storeys. Local resident Keville expressed that the proposed changes do not meet the community's needs. However, a spokesperson for HIM, the developer, expressed disappointment over the calls for withdrawal, stating the plan is compliant with policy and was recommended for approval by planning officers.
