The Regulator of Social Housing has raised serious concerns about Oldham Council's management of social housing. A new report highlights the council’s limited awareness of its landlord responsibilities and significant engagement flaws with tenants. Due to Oldham's reliance on Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) for housing management, the council had a light touch in oversight until recent regulatory changes mandated greater involvement. While tenant satisfaction and repairs performance appear satisfactory, the council struggles with accountability and accessing essential data from PFI firms. Less than half of homes have had recent condition surveys, raising questions about their state despite claims of decent living conditions. Councillor Elaine Taylor acknowledged the judgement and outlined steps for improvement, including expanding the social housing management team and enhancing communication with tenants. The council received a C3 rating, part of a broader inspection where few councils scored higher. Overall, the council aims to bolster governance, safety checks, and tenant engagement following the watchdog's findings.
