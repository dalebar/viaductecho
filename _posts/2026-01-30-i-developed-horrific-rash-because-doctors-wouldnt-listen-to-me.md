Lily Thompstone, 23, from Bury, Greater Manchester, dealt with gut issues for years, often dismissed by doctors as IBS. After waking up with swollen lips and developing a widespread rash, she sought help at A&E, receiving steroids for the swelling. Despite multiple visits to GPs, where she was misdiagnosed with light sensitivity and psoriasis, she felt her symptoms were more serious. Eventually, after persistent pushing, she was diagnosed with endometriosis in June 2024, finding the condition throughout her body. Lily believes her rash was her body's way of signalling distress after years of ignoring symptoms. Though grateful it led to her diagnosis, she faced significant mental health challenges and urges other women to advocate for themselves and not to overlook their discomfort. She highlights the importance of listening to your body and seeking answers, saying, “Let this be your sign to stop stressing your body out before it turns on you.”
