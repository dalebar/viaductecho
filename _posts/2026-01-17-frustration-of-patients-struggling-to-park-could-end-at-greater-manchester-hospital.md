A new multi-storey car park is set to open at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to tackle parking frustrations for patients and visitors. Launching on January 16, the facility will provide 356 spaces, plus 64 surface spaces for staff, 21 disabled parking spaces, and 20 electric vehicle charging points. Chief Executive Mary Fleming highlighted the project’s importance for enhancing the visitor experience and thanked the community for their input during the planning stage. The new car park will add a total of 420 spaces across the WWL trust, with recent improvements including card payment options and an ANPR system. Chief Finance Officer Tabitha Gardner expressed gratitude for patient feedback and praised the teams behind the swift development.
