Two Labour councillors in Stockport, Joe and Rosemary Barratt, have left the party, criticising Keir Starmer’s leadership for failing to provide the necessary vision for change, claiming that Labour is 'sleepwalking' towards a majority Reform government. Joe Barratt, who served as deputy leader, expressed his disillusionment after over 15 years in the party, stating that Labour has lost its way and the party's current direction isn’t addressing the country’s urgent needs. The Barratts have now formed the Bredbury and Woodley Independents and are looking to challenge both Labour and the Lib Dems in the upcoming 2026 elections. They feel that local political figures like Andy Burnham should guide Labour to regain public trust. Meanwhile, Stockport Labour, now the largest opposition group with 19 councillors, is selecting a new deputy after their departure. Coun Christine Carrigan, the Labour leader, expressed disappointment but remains committed to serving residents. The situation has led to concerns about a fragmented council landscape ahead of the next local elections, with potential threats from independent groups aiming to expand their influence.
