Progress is well underway on Marple's new community and leisure hub, set to open in Autumn 2026. The facility will feature a modern library, a five-lane swimming pool, a 60-station gym, a café, and the relocated Marple Clinic. With the roof on and the pool in place, teams are now focusing on the exterior and preparing for the interior fit-out later this year. Cllr Micheala Meikle expressed excitement for the project, highlighting its potential to greatly benefit the town by providing modern leisure and health services, while creating a welcoming community space. The hub is replacing outdated buildings, including the former swimming pool that closed in 2018. It promises to transform the skyline and become a cherished landmark for local residents.
