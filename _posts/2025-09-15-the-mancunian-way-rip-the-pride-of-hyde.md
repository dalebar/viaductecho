The four-time world champion was discovered at his home in Tameside, sparking an outpouring of grief across the community. Hatton, known for his relentless fighting style and down-to-earth personality, won hearts not just for his boxing prowess. He openly discussed his struggles with mental health and addiction, making him relatable and beloved. Growing up in Hattersley, he cherished his roots and maintained a close connection to his local pub mates, who treated him like one of their own. The atmosphere at The Queen Adelaide, one of his favourite pubs, was heavy as locals remembered their hero. Hatton was not just a champion; he was a man of the people, well-loved for his quick wit and humour, and he enjoyed mingling with fans even after achieving fame. His legacy extends beyond the ring, becoming a source of pride for the area he represented.
