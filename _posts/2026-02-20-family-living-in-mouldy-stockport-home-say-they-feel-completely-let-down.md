A family in Stockport has been struggling with a mouldy home for years, feeling let down by their landlord, Stockport Homes. Dylan Cullen, 21, and his family have lived at their property on Otley Grove for 12 years, battling persistent damp issues that remain unresolved despite attempts by Stockport Homes to fix them. The family has reportedly spent a fortune on re-decorating every few months, and health concerns are rising due to the ongoing mould. Dylan expressed frustration with the landlord's unresponsiveness and inadequate repairs, stating they've had three failed damp-proof courses and that surveyors recommend a complete bathroom replacement, which Stockport Homes has declined to do. The situation is affecting the family’s finances and health, particularly Dylan’s mother, whose well-being has suffered over the years. Stockport Homes has faced criticism for slow repairs and is working to reduce their backlog, but tenants like Dylan remain dissatisfied with the lack of timely solutions.
