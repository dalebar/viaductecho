Staff on the Bee Network in Greater Manchester are getting training to better assist passengers with dementia. By year's end, 540 employees across buses, trams, and interchanges will be equipped with the skills to support those living with dementia, enhancing the inclusivity of public transport in the area. About 10% of those over 65 in the UK have dementia, making this training vital, as this age group represents one in six journeys in Greater Manchester. Dr Joy Watson, an Alzheimer's campaigner, is pushing for this initiative. Vernon Everitt, the Greater Manchester Transport Commissioner, highlighted the importance of accessible public transport for maintaining independence among those with dementia. He noted that the training will empower staff to recognise when someone needs help. All frontline staff will complete Alzheimer's Society training by the end of the year, with plans to include bus drivers in future training efforts.
