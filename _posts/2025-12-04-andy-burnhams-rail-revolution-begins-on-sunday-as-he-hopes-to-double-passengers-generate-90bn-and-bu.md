Greater Manchester kicks off its 'rail revolution' this weekend, with Mayor Andy Burnham aiming to double train passengers, build 75,000 homes, and grow the economy by £90bn. The plan involves integrating 96 stations and commuter rail lines into the Bee Network, allowing easy transfers between trams, trains, and buses at the lowest fares. Starting Sunday, tickets are simplified and average prices reduced by 5%. By next year, selected rail lines will adopt tap-and-go tech, similar to buses and trams, eliminating the need for tickets. The initiative also identifies Ashton and Stalybridge as key areas for growth, with railway land primed for development. Despite some industry sceptics calling the plans 'ambitious,' Burnham insists there’s solid collaboration among the rail industry players, putting a united front behind the vision, even as some elements remain a way off, like a new underground station at Piccadilly. Overall, it's an optimistic step towards a more integrated, affordable transport network for the region.
