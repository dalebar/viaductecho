A flood alert's been issued across two Greater Manchester boroughs due to a yellow weather warning for rain, with four alerts now in effect. Heavy downpours are expected to persist, raising river levels in areas like Bramhall, Stockport, Sale, Altrincham, and Urmston. Residents in low-lying areas, particularly around Micker, Cringle, Sinderland, and Poynton Brooks, should stay vigilant. The Environment Agency also warns of potential flooding along the Lower River Irwell, impacting Manchester city centre, as well as the River Bollin around Hale, Knutsford, Wilmslow, Macclesfield, and Bollington. An earlier warning is in place for the Upper River Irwell affecting parts of Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, and Bury. Locals are urged to prepare and stay updated on alerts, ready to follow flood plans if necessary. Meanwhile, Manchester Airport's dealing with delays and one runway's closed for repairs due to the weather.
