Heavy rain is forecast for Greater Manchester today, with downpours expected through the morning and afternoon, easing to lighter rain later. Friday will start dry with some sun but will see heavy rain return in the afternoon. Temperatures will peak at around 8C, dropping to 2C tonight. The weekend looks milder, with overnight temps of 5C on Friday and highs of 11C on Saturday and 12C on Sunday, although light rain is expected Saturday morning. Sunday should be cloudy but dry. Looking ahead, next week will bring drier weather with pleasant sunny intervals on Monday and Wednesday, when temperatures could reach 14C on Tuesday—pretty close to Barcelona! Expect overnight lows between 7C and 9C.
