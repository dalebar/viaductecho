Train services between Manchester and Liverpool were paused due to a police incident. Manchester Piccadilly announced that Northern trains were suspended, while TransPennine Express and East Midlands trains would reroute via Newton-le-Willows. As of now, services have resumed as normal, but some routes remain affected, particularly those between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly via Warrington Central. The disruption was caused by a trespassing incident blocking all lines. National Rail noted that trains could face cancellations, delays of up to 60 minutes, or diversions.
