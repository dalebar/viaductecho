The bus strikes in Greater Manchester, which were set to disrupt around 190 services starting tomorrow, have been called off last minute. Most bus routes will now operate normally this weekend after Unite the Union announced it would suspend the strikes while they ballot drivers on a new pay offer from bus operators Metroline and Stagecoach. Mayor Andy Burnham expressed relief at the decision, emphasising the importance of bus drivers for the Bee Network and hoping for a swift agreement to prevent future disruptions. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) warned that there might still be some limited disruption, advising passengers to check their service status before travelling.
