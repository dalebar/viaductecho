In Prestwich, armed police swooped on a house linked to Jihad Al-Shamie, the suspected attacker involved in a synagogue shooting that left two men dead and three injured. Neighbour Simon Barlass witnessed the event unfold on Langley Crescent, where police cars and approximately 25 armed officers arrived shortly after the attack on October 2. Barlass described the officers as heavily equipped, some even with shields and a chainsaw. The house they surrounded is reportedly where Al-Shamie lived with a family member. While he didnâ€™t see any arrests made, he did observe officers taking boxes in and out of the property. Barlass, who previously lived in the same house, mentioned seeing a 'Syrian family' and recognised a car he believed was associated with the attack parked nearby in the days leading up to the incident. Counter-terror police confirmed that several individuals, including two men and a woman, have been arrested in connection with the case.
