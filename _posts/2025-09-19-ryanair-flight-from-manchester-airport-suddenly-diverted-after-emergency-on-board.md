A Ryanair flight from Manchester to Malaga had to divert to Bordeaux, France, due to a medical emergency. The incident happened about 80 minutes into the flight on Thursday night. The pilot signalled for emergency assistance and landed in MÃ©rignac airport at roughly 10:20 pm, where medics were ready to help the ill passenger, who was then taken to a hospital. Ryanair later confirmed that the flight continued to Malaga a few hours later without further issues, though details on the passenger's condition remain unknown. The airline praised the crew for their swift action in arranging medical assistance.
