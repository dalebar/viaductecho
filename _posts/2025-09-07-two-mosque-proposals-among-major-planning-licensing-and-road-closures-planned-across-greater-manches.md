Several significant planning proposals have been tabled across Greater Manchester this week, including plans for two major mosques. The Jalalia Jaame Mosque in Rochdale is set for an upgrade, with a new dome and minaret, as well as increased interior space to meet modern needs. Meanwhile, plans for a new mosque in Prestwich have hit a pause for councillors to visit the site. 

In further developments, Bury council is collecting feedback on a proposal to close or restrict traffic on a town centre road to enhance social spaces. A new housing estate with 350 homes on green belt land near the M66 has also been proposed. Other notable projects include the creation of a nursery at an old farm in Chadderton and major changes planned for Stockport town centre, funded by nearly Â£10m from the government.

Additionally, plans for a telecommunications mast in Old Trafford and a new transport hub in Ashton connecting bus, tram, and train services are also on the cards, showcasing a busy week of urban development in the region.
