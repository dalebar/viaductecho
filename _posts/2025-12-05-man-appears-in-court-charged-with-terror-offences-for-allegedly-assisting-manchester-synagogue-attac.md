Mohammad Bashir, 31, from Cheetham Hill, is facing four terrorism charges after allegedly driving Jihad Al-Shamie to the UK's Defence Academy for reconnaissance before the recent synagogue attack in Manchester. This latest court appearance revealed that the acts were intended to assist Al-Shamie, who tragically carried out the October 2 attack on Heaton Park Synagogue, resulting in two fatalities before being shot by police. Bashir also faces three additional charges for sharing terrorist content via WhatsApp, including materials titled 'The Book of Jihad' and videos promoting martyrdom. He was arrested at Manchester Airport on November 27 and is currently remanded in custody, with his next court date set for December 12 at the Old Bailey.
