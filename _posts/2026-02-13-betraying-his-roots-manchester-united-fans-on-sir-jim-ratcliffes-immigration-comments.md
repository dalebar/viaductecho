Sir Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, has faced backlash over his comments about immigration, stating that Britain has been "colonised by immigrants" and warning against the rising welfare costs linked to immigration. His remarks stirred controversy, particularly among residents of Failsworth, where he grew up. While some, like 62-year-old Rob Cosgrove, criticized him for "betraying his roots," arguing that immigrants enrich a country, others, like 84-year-old Ann, acknowledged his views but felt it wasn't racist to highlight perceived favoritism towards immigrants. Fans outside Old Trafford expressed their disgust at his comments, with one supporter calling for his resignation from the club. Matthew, 24, labelled Ratcliffe's remarks as "horribly unfounded," emphasising the need for respect towards immigrants. The debate highlights a split in opinions, with many feeling that his wealthy lifestyle in Monaco undermines his position to comment on these issues.
