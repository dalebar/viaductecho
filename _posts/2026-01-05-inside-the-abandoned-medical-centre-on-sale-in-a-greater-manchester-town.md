The old Donald Wilde Medical Centre in Coldhurst is set for auction on February 3, with a guide price of £275k. This abandoned facility, which closed sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic, used to serve around 5,000 patients who were told to find new GP services via abrupt messages. Now, the 3,110 sqft building is being marketed as a prime investment opportunity, with potential for refurbishment or conversion into various uses, pending approvals. 

A TikTok creator featured the site, prompting mixed reactions from viewers, some nostalgic about its past as a top doctors’ practice in Oldham. Locals speculated about its future, including turning it into a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO), as another similar conversion is being considered by the council, despite local pushback. Questions also linger about the sudden closure, with no clear explanation provided, although Oldham CCG indicated it was by mutual agreement with the GPs in charge. The property still holds remnants of its former life, complete with furniture and fittings from when it operated as a medical centre.
