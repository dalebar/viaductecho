A corner shop in Bury town centre, Express Mini Market, was temporarily shut down for two months after illegal goods worth up to £40,000 were discovered. Bury council used legal powers for the first time to enforce this closure due to multiple violations, including complaints about selling vapes to underage customers. The crackdown led to the seizure of over 6,300 illegal cigarettes, 1.7kg of hand-rolling tobacco, and 3,010 non-compliant vapes, among other unsafe products. Councillor Charlotte Morris emphasised that this is part of a wider initiative to tackle illegal trading and public health concerns surrounding unsafe tobacco products. The council aims to prevent businesses from resuming illicit activities once the two-month closure is over and encourages the public to report any suspicious activities. Chief Inspector Michael Barton from GMP's Bury district stressed the importance of addressing the sale of dangerous goods.
