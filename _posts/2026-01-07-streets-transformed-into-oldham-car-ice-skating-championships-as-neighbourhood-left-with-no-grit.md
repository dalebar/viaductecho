Residents in Glodwick, Oldham, are taking action after heavy snowfall left their streets untreated, turning them into a slippery hazard. While the council has managed to clear main routes, many residential areas, particularly around Waterloo Street, lack grit bins, which were removed in 2023. Locals like Naseeb Abbas have expressed frustration, noting that the icy roads are making daily life a struggle. Brothers Sonny and Shahjahan Chowdhury have even started spreading salt from bags to help their community, highlighting the dangers of cars skidding and elderly people having difficulty crossing streets. Council officials state that while they focus on main roads for gritting, there are over 600 grit bins across the borough, and placements are based on specific criteria. Some councillors can fund additional bins from their budgets, but the decision made in 2023 not to sponsor them has left residents feeling unsupported during this wintry weather. A local councillor acknowledged that grit bin provision should be seen as a fundamental service, not just an optional extra.
