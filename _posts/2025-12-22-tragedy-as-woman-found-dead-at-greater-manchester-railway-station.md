A woman in her 30s was found dead at Bryn railway station in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Wigan, on Friday evening (December 19). Emergency services were called at around 6pm, but sadly, she was pronounced dead at the scene. British Transport Police confirmed that the incident isn't considered suspicious and they'll prepare a file for the coroner. Local councillor Danny Fletcher expressed his support on Facebook, sending thoughts to the woman's family and friends, and mentioned that the council would assist where needed. Train services between Wigan North Western and Liverpool Lime Street were briefly halted but resumed by 9.15pm. Anyone struggling emotionally is encouraged to contact Samaritans for support, available 24/7, even during the festive season.
