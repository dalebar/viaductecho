Vietnam Airlines and Vietjet Air have joined the trend of banning power banks onboard flights, following concerns over lithium battery safety. This comes after several incidents reported by the US FAA, highlighting the risks of thermal runaway from lithium batteries stored in overhead bins or carry-on baggage. Passengers can still bring power banks onboard but can’t use them or charge them inflight. Emirates, which operates routes from Manchester, will enforce similar rules from October 1, 2025, allowing one power bank but prohibiting its usage during the flight. This decision is aimed at enhancing safety after a power bank incident caused significant damage to an aircraft earlier this year. The UK Civil Aviation Authority advises keeping lithium batteries in carry-on luggage, ensuring they’re switched off to reduce fire risks. As travellers from Manchester and beyond rely on these devices, it’s essential to follow the guidelines to ensure a safe flying experience. Keep your gadgets stashed and safe, folks!
