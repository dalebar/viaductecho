Manchester's Chinese New Year celebrations for 2026 are set for the weekend of February 14-15, leading up to the official event on February 17, marking the Year of the Fire Horse. The festivities will feature a vibrant dragon parade, live performances, street food, and family activities — transforming Chinatown with red lanterns and music. However, expect significant traffic disruptions with various road closures and parking restrictions around the city centre. 

Key closures include: Nicholas Street, St James Street, and Faulkner Street from 5am on February 14 until midnight on February 15. On parade day, additional closures will affect Peter Street and Oxford Street between 10am and 3pm. Parking will also be suspended in affected areas during this time. Accessible parking will be relocated to Fountain Street and Mount Street throughout the celebrations. The dragon parade promises to be a highlight, commencing at noon and concluding in Chinatown for an exciting finale!
