On Wednesday, Stockport’s weather looks a bit dreary, with clouds and rain set to dominate the day. Expect chilly temperatures from 2°C in the morning to a peak of 11°C in the afternoon, but brisk winds at 27mph will make it feel even cooler. As the morning rolls in, skies will go from partly cloudy to completely overcast, with a guaranteed downpour by midday. Evening will continue with rain, and as night falls, temperatures will drop again. 

If you're commuting, give yourself extra time as roads might be slippery and visibility can drop during heavy rain. Best bet? Bring a sturdy coat or an umbrella. Dressing in layers is the way to go to handle the temperature swings, and with those winds, you might want to stick to indoor plans if you can. Stay on top of the weather updates to tweak your day as needed!
