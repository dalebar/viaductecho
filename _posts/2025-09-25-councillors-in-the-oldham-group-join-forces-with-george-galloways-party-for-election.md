A bunch of independent councillors in Oldham have teamed up with George Galloway’s Workers Party for the upcoming local elections. They’re rolling out two candidates, Rangzaib Nazir in Werneth and Saqib Javaid in South Chadderton, under the banner of ‘Oldham Group and Workers Party’. This alliance stems from a recent meeting, aiming to boost their electoral chances and strengthen their relationship. The Workers Party is known for its socialist and working-class stance, alongside socially conservative views and an anti-Nato position. Kamran Ghafoor, the leader of the Oldham Group, expressed excitement about the partnership, focusing on dismantling Labour's hold in the area. They’re also open to collaborating with other political entities. Galloway emphasised that this is about giving power back to the people of Oldham, marking the start of a broader movement. The elections are set for May 7, 2026, so it’ll be one to watch!
