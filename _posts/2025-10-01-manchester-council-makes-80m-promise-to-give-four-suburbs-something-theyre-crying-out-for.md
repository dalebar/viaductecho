Manchester council has committed £80 million to improve four local areas: Benchill South & Wythenshawe Central, Harpurhey South & Monsall, Clayton Vale, and Gorton South. Each neighbourhood will receive £20 million from the government to address what residents really want. Local councillors emphasise that the funding will be shaped by community voices, ensuring residents have a say in how it’s spent. Coun John Hughes stated it will be built with the community, not imposed on them. Coun Astrid Johnson expressed excitement about empowering residents to shape their neighbourhoods, while Coun Emma Taylor urged for quick action to start community discussions and implement changes. Plans include reviving high streets, enhancing parks, and revitalising public spaces. Aiming for community-led decisions, PM Keir Starmer noted that the real impact comes from those invested in their communities—the local residents.
