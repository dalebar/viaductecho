The Christmas markets in Manchester have been a staple since 1999, but before that, the festive season had its own lovely charm. Reflecting on Christmases from the 1950s to the 1990s, thanks to Mirrorpix and Manchester Libraries, we can enjoy a peek into simpler times through nostalgic photos. 

Images capture the bustling Christmas tree at Victoria Station, queues of eager shoppers at Kendals, and children on Santa’s lap at the former Lewis’s. There are scenes of snowy streets, festive displays in department stores, and kids enjoying a 'Christmas Wonderland' in Piccadilly Gardens during the 80s and 90s. 

These snapshots remind us that the spirit of Christmas in Manchester has always been about community, joy, and a touch of festive chaos. They spark fond memories—did any of these images resonate with your own Christmas experiences in the city? Let’s hear your thoughts!
