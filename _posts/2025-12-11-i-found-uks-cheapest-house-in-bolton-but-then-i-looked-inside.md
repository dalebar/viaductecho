YouTuber David Burnip has been on a mission to find the UK's cheapest properties, and his latest find in Bolton, Greater Manchester, left him shocked. He explored a two-bedroomed terraced house that was absolutely filthy, featuring mouldy walls and cobweb-filled ceilings. Disturbingly, the previous tenants had only vacated three weeks prior. David found it unsettling, especially in a room decorated with Barbie posters, which suggested a young girl had lived there.

The house, which he referred to as a "House of Horrors," was in dire need of a complete makeover. Despite its condition, the property fetched over three times its guide price at auction, selling for £103,000 after a surprising bidding war. David highlighted the oddity of the situation, noting that the kitchen looked as if it had "been attacked by the Amazon jungle," yet the market still responded with interest. Though it’s a leasehold property, which can be less desirable, the sale proved how unpredictable the housing market can be.
