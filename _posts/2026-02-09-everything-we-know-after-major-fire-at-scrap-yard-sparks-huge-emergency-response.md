A large fire broke out at the J Davidson scrap site on Craven Road in Broadheath just before 3pm on Sunday, February 8. Emergency services, including five fire engines and an aerial ladder, responded rapidly as thick smoke filled the air, visible from miles away across Greater Manchester. Roads were cordoned off for safety, and residents were advised to stay clear and keep their windows shut. This incident closely mirrors a similar fire at the same site last March, involving scrap vehicles. While the cause of the blaze remains under investigation and hasn't been confirmed, it reportedly involved a significant quantity of metal. J Davidson has yet to comment on the situation.
