Concerns are rising for Houldsworth Golf Club in Reddish, Stockport, established in 1910, as plans to build 122 homes on part of its land could threaten its future. With over 500 members, the club's directors warn that losing significant parts of the car park and golf course would jeopardise its viability. The council’s draft local plan, aimed at addressing housing needs, has caused alarm about the loss of green spaces. Members are particularly worried about the impact on community events and access for older golfers. Despite being informed of the plans only through social media, the club has officially objected to Stockport Council. Local councillor Rachel Wise emphasised the importance of preserving green spaces like the golf club, while Coun Jake Austin from the Lib Dem administration described the government’s housing targets as a 'land-grab'. Community members are advocating for a balanced approach to housing and the preservation of amenities.
