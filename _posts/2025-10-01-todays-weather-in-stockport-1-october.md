Wednesday in Stockport is looking quite overcast and damp, with rain likely throughout the morning and afternoon. Temperatures will be between 12°C and 15°C, but the 85% humidity and 11 mph winds will make it feel chillier. So, it’s definitely a day for the umbrellas and raincoats! 

Expect mostly cloudy skies all day, which means little sunshine to lift the gloom. With the damp and muggy atmosphere, outdoor plans may not be very appealing. For those heading out, make sure you dress warmly in layers and keep waterproofs handy to stay comfy. 

If you're commuting, plan for potential delays due to wet roads and reduced visibility. Better to take it slow and steady! If you have to be outside, watch for slippery spots and puddles. Overall, it might be best to hunker down indoors, but if you do venture out, just be prepared for the drizzly weather!
