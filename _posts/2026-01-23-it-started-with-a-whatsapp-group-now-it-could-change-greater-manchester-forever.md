On February 8, 2025, a significant scandal rocked Tameside politics, centered around a WhatsApp group called "Trigger Me Timbers," which included MP Andrew Gwynne. The group was found to contain antisemitic remarks and offensive comments about constituents, leading to Gwynne's sacking as a junior health minister and his subsequent resignation after 21 years as an MP. Following the scandal, numerous Labour councillors and MPs were suspended or expelled. Gwynne stepped down on January 22, citing health issues, leading to a potential by-election in Gorton and Denton, possibly on May 7. 

Speculation has arisen around Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham possibly returning to Westminster for the vacant seat. While he's committed to his mayoral role, he hasn’t ruled out a leadership bid. However, Burnham would need the Labour National Executive Committee's permission to stand, which could be challenging due to their influence and potential restrictions like an all-female shortlist. This development could significantly impact local governance and the direction of policy in Greater Manchester, leaving many curious about the future.
