Rail passengers in Greater Manchester are facing disruptions due to a crew shortage and a broken rail in Hazel Grove. Northern has warned of potential cancellations and delays affecting services through Stockport, particularly on routes between Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport, and Buxton. With this happening just before Christmas, it's likely to be extra busy. A National Rail spokesperson noted that the broken rail is blocking trains towards Manchester Piccadilly, causing delays of up to 15 minutes or diversions. Services from Sheffield, Buxton, and various other routes are impacted, including TransPennine Express and East Midlands Railway. Some trains may be diverted, leading to longer journey times. Ticket restrictions have been lifted for those affected, and passengers are advised to check for updates before heading out. Disruption is expected to last until around 6.15pm.
