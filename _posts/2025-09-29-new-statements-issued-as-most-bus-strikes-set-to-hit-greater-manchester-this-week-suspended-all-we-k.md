The planned strike action by over 2,000 bus workers in Greater Manchester has been suspended. Unite the Union members from Stagecoach Manchester, First Bus Rochdale, and Metroline Manchester were set to strike from September 30 to October 2 due to pay disputes. Recent talks have led to a breakthrough, particularly with Stagecoach and First, who have put forward revised pay offers. Stagecoachâ€™s proposal includes an almost nine per cent pay increase by April 2026, while First has yet to disclose full details of its offer. Workers at Metroline are also considering a new proposal. Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham expressed optimism about resolving the situation fairly for the drivers while maintaining affordability for the Bee Network. Both Stagecoach and First confirmed that strike plans have been called off, highlighting their commitment to finding a fair resolution for their staff. Metroline has not yet commented on the developments.
