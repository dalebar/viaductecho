Rochdale's set to host a brilliant night-time light and audio experience in early 2026, described as a heartfelt 'love-letter to Rochdale.' This event will feature stunning projections, moving images, and immersive 3D sound, telling local stories through the voices and memories of residents. It aims to reshape the town's narrative and comes back four years after its first run in Deeplish. The performances will light up familiar spots like Rochdale Town Hall Square, running from 28th January to 31st January and from 3rd February to 6th February at 6pm and 7.30pm daily. Kick-off is at Rochdale Train Station, finishing at the Town Hall. It's free, but booking is a must. The route's accessible for wheelchairs and prams, and there'll be headphones and helpful volunteers throughout. Don't miss out—book your free tickets!
