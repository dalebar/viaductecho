A new river walk, 'The Mersey Valley Way', is set to launch, stretching 21km from Stockport to Manchester along the River Mersey. It will enhance 4km of current pathways for better accessibility for walkers, wheelchair users, prams, cyclists, and horse-riders, with expected completion by Spring 2026. The initiative, part of a government plan for nine new river walks, aims to boost outdoor access, especially for those in lower-income groups, like the 36,000 residents in poverty in Stockport. Improvements will include upgraded paths, lighting, and signage to draw walkers from neighbouring areas and support local businesses. Cllr Grace Baynham highlighted its potential to enhance health and wellbeing for all ages and backgrounds. With over 3 million residents within an hour's journey, the route will be accessible via public transport and cycle paths. Both Baroness Hayman and local leaders expressed enthusiasm for increasing nature access in the region, focusing on the benefits of enjoying the outdoors.
