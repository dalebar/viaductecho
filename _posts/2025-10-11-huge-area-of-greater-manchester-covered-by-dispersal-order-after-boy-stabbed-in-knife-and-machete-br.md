Police in east Manchester and Stockport have ramped up stop and search powers in response to a stabbing incident involving a teenage boy. The violence erupted in the Ryder Brow area of Gorton on the night of October 10, prompting officers to respond to reports of a group armed with knives. A 17-year-old boy was found injured and has since been arrested for violent disorder. Following the incident, a Section 60 Order was implemented, allowing police to search individuals in a designated area without needing specific suspicion. The order is effective for 24 hours and covers several local areas. Detective Inspector Natasha Feerick reassured residents that the police are committed to tackling violent crime and have increased patrols in the vicinity. Theyâ€™re also asking anyone with information to reach out to Greater Manchester Police or contact Crimestoppers anonymously.
