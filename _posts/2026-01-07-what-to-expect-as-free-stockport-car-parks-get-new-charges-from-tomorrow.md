Starting 8 January, Stockport's council is introducing charges at 18 free car parks, with an additional six charging from 10 February. The new fees range from 50p for an hour to £2.40 for a whole day. Councillors believe this move will help fund the roads and public services amid budget pressures. A limited number of resident permits will be available for nearby locals without access to on-street parking, costing £47.50 per year (£23.75 for Leisure Key holders).

Councillor Grace Baynham emphasised the need for the charges to maintain the transport network, although some councillors voiced concerns about the impact on local businesses, suggesting a one-hour grace period for quick visits. However, Cllr Baynham ruled that out, citing cost implications. The introduced charges aim to improve parking turnover for shoppers.

The car parks affected include spots in areas like Marple Bridge, Bramhall, and Cheadle Hulme, with more charges coming to additional locations soon.
