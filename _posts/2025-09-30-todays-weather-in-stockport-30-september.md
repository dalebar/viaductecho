Today in Stockport, expect a lovely partly cloudy day with mild temperatures ranging from 8°C to 17°C. It'll feel a bit muggy with humidity at 80%, but no rain is forecasted, so it should stay dry. Light winds at around 8 mph will keep things comfortable for outdoor plans. 

For commuters, the weather’s solid for travel, given the dry roads—just keep an eye out for usual traffic. Layer up for those brisk morning and evening temps, and maybe carry a light jacket. Staying hydrated is a good shout too. Enjoy your Tuesday!
