In Trafford, seven out of the top ten secondary schools in Greater Manchester have excelled in GCSE results, according to the latest data from the Department for Education. This year's performance rankings reveal Altrincham Grammar School for Girls at the top with an impressive 99.5% of pupils achieving a grade 5 or higher in English and Maths. Following closely are Saint Ambrose College and Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, both at 98%. Other notable mentions in the top spots include Sale Grammar, Stretford Grammar, and Urmston Grammar. The only school outside Trafford in the top ten is Cheadle Hulme High School, a fee-paying institution. Due to pandemic disruptions, there's no 'added value' progress score this year, which usually helps families gauge improvement over time. GCSE results across England have shown a slight overall increase, though the pass rate for English and Maths dipped slightly from the previous year, highlighting ongoing regional disparities, particularly between the North East and London.
