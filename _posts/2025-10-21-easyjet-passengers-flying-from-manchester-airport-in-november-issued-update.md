easyJet is shifting all its flights at Manchester Airport to the revamped Terminal 2 starting November 19. This change comes as part of a £1.3 billion upgrade of the terminal, which has nearly doubled in size. Terminal 1 will close to enable Terminal 3’s expansion, and easyJet will join other airlines like British Airways and Aer Lingus in operating from the new terminal. Passengers are encouraged to allow extra time for their journeys and follow the airport signage, as staff will be around to assist during the transition. Terminal 2 boasts new shops and facilities, including a Lego store and Joe and The Juice. This transformation aims to enhance the travel experience for over 70% of airport users, with the original Terminal 2 set to be fully updated soon.
