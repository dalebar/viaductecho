Following an attack on Heaton Park synagogue in north Manchester on October 2, schools in the area are reassuring parents that pupils are safe and classes are running as normal. The incident, which occurred early on Yom Kippur, involved a suspect who was shot by armed police after driving into a group of people and stabbing an individual. Tragically, two members of the public were killed, and three others are in serious condition. Hospitals in the region briefly went on lockdown but this has since been lifted. Increased police presence has been established at synagogues across Greater Manchester to ensure safety. Local schools like Marlborough Road Academy and Light Oaks Junior School have communicated with parents, confirming that they have consulted with police and there have been no disturbances, ensuring the schools remain secure. Authorities are committed to keeping the Jewish community safe during this difficult time.
