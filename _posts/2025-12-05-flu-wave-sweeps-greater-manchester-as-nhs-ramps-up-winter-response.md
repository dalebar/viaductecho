A&E departments in Greater Manchester are feeling the strain as flu cases surge, leading to increased hospital admissions. NHS England reports that flu cases have skyrocketed, with hospital bed occupancy hitting record highs for this time of year, averaging 1,717 patients a day. Health officials are implementing extra measures to cope with the demand, including enhancing primary care and reinforcing infection-prevention tactics. They advise anyone with flu-like symptoms to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid mixing with others, particularly vulnerable individuals. The NHS also stresses the importance of vaccinations to mitigate pressure on services. With expected industrial action from December 17 to 22, the NHS is preparing for potential peak demand as emergency departments are already extremely busy. In some instances, patients have waited over 50 hours for a bed. The NHS encourages everyone eligible in Greater Manchester to get their flu jab ahead of Christmas. For guidance on urgent care needs, using NHS 111 or local primary care services is recommended.
