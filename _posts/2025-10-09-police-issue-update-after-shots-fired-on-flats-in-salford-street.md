Five men have been arrested in connection with a shooting at flats on Lissadel Street in Pendleton, Salford, on October 6. Shots were fired between 8.45pm and 9pm, leaving several bullet holes in the windows and front door. Police were notified the next morning, leading them to establish a cordon for forensic investigation. The suspects, aged 20 to 39, have since been released on bail. Brian Cooper, a local resident, expressed his shock at the incident, saying he only learned of it from police while visiting his mum. He described the area as quiet and mentioned this was unexpected. Detective Chief Inspector Martyn Johnson acknowledged the community's concerns and called the use of firearms unacceptable, urging anyone with information to come forward.
