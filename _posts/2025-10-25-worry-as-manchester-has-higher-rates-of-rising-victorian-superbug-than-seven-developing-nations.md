Cases of tuberculosis (TB) are on the rise in Manchester, now reporting a higher incidence rate than several developing nations, including Armenia and Trinidad and Tobago. In England, notifications of TB reached 5,490 in 2024, a 13% increase from 2023. The rate in Manchester stands at 25.3 per 100,000, significantly above the WHO's low-incidence threshold of 10. Four areas in Greater Manchester also exceed this threshold: Bolton, Oldham, and Salford. TB, once a major killer, is now curable, yet it remains a serious public health issue, particularly in urban areas and among deprived populations. Symptoms to watch for include a persistent cough lasting more than three weeks, fever, and unexplained weight loss. The UK Health Security Agency urges quick action to identify and treat cases to stem the rise. If you suspect you could be at risk, it's crucial to see your GP.
