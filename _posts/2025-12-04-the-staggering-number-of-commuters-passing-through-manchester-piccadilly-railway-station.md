Manchester Piccadilly has been crowned the second busiest railway station outside London for the second consecutive year, registering 27.4 million passenger movements in 2024/25—an increase from 25.8 million the previous year. It just beat Leeds for second place, while Birmingham New Street remains the busiest outside the capital with 36.6 million. Central Manchester's other station, Victoria, also saw a notable rise with 8.4 million passengers. While the figures underline Manchester's growing importance as a transport hub, all top 10 most-used stations in the UK are still in or around London, led by Liverpool Street with a hefty 98 million entries and exits. Other busy North West stations include Liverpool Central and Lime Street. The Office of Rail and Road highlights a broader rise in rail travel, influenced by investments like the Elizabeth line, with 1.73 billion journeys made nationally—up 7% from last year. These insights help shape the future of Britain’s rail network.
