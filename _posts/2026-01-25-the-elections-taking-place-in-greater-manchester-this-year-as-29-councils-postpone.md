Westminster has allowed 29 councils to delay their elections to next year, extending councillors' terms from four to five years. This move ties in with plans to streamline local governance in England by merging two-tier councils into single-tier systems, aimed at reducing waste and improving efficiency. However, all ten councils in Greater Manchester – including Manchester City, Bury, and Bolton – will still go ahead with their elections on May 7, as they aren’t part of this restructuring. Additionally, Gorton and Denton will see a parliamentary by-election soon, sparked by MP Andrew Gwynne stepping down. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is expected to run in that by-election, but if elected, he'd have to resign from his mayoral role, leading to another vote for his replacement. As it stands, there won’t be a mayoral election this year, as Burnham was last re-elected in 2024, with the next election set for 2028.
