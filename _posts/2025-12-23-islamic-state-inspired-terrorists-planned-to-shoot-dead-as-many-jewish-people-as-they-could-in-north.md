Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein plotted a horrific attack in north Manchester, targeting Jewish communities, aiming to kill as many people as possible, including children. They planned a mass shooting during a pro-Israel march, seeing their actions as martyrdom in the name of Allah. Over several recorded discussions, Saadaoui revealed chilling intentions to attack synagogues, schools, and community gatherings, showing a particular fixation on harming children. They scouted potential targets, expressing vile anti-Semitic sentiments and even discussing poisoning water at schools to inflict harm. Their ‘primary target’ was a pro-Israel march, which Saadaoui described as a gathering of ‘original Jews supporting Israel’. They planned to execute their attack using firearms, with Saadaoui claiming that their attack would be live-streamed. Both men are now remanded, waiting for sentencing at Preston Crown Court on February 13.
