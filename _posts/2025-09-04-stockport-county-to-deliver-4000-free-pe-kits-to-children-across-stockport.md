Stockport County is set to distribute 4,000 free PE kits to local children this September as part of their 'Kits by County' initiative, which began in 2024. The initiative aims to ensure that all children in the borough can participate in sports, irrespective of their families' financial situations. Following the distribution of 3,000 kits already, the club is on target to donate a total of 12,000 kits to primary school students.

The project has noticeably increased PE participation, with some schools reporting that children who previously missed classes due to stigma are now attending. Funded through fan contributions and corporate donations, the scheme highlights the club's commitment to community support. Owner Mark Stott commented on the importance of inclusion and opportunity in sports. Goalkeeper Corey Addai shared his personal experience, emphasizing how crucial access to PE is for building confidence in children. The club encourages other organisations to adopt similar initiatives in their areas.
