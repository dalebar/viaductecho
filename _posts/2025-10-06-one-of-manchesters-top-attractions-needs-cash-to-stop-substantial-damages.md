The People’s History Museum (PHM) in Manchester is facing significant damage due to leaks from its ageing roof, as confirmed by museum bosses. This popular attraction, ranked sixth on TripAdvisor, draws in over 125,000 visitors each year. PHM has applied for planning permission to replace the roof of its Grade II listed Edwardian pump house, but can only proceed with repairs if they secure necessary funding. The building, opened in 1909 and designated a heritage site in 1992, is vital to Mancunian history, once powering local civic buildings and mills. The museum’s spokesperson emphasised their commitment to preserving this unique structure but highlighted their reliance on donations and fundraising for the work to move forward. The planning application includes extensive roof repairs and masonry work. Excitingly, despite these challenges, PHM is gearing up to host festive markets from November 21-23, kicking off with a launch event on November 20, featuring live music and mulled wine.
