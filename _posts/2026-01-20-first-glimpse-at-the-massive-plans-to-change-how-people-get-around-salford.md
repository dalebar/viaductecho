Salford is set for a transport overhaul, aiming to enhance public transit, cycling, and walking along the busy number 50 bus route from Manchester to MediaCity. This initiative, backed by the council and Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), is part of a £2.5bn regeneration plan that will introduce faster, more reliable bus journeys and improved cycling lanes. Key upgrades include new bus lanes, upgraded stops with better accessibility, and safer junctions with pedestrian signals. Councillor Mike McCusker emphasised the goal of making travel safe and efficient for everyone in Salford while reducing congestion. The local community is invited to share feedback on the proposals through an online survey until February 22 and attend two public drop-in sessions. The changes also tie in with expansions to the Metrolink and new bus routes, supporting Greater Manchester’s vision for a more connected transport system.
