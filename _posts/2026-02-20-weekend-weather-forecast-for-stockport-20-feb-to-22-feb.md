This weekend in Stockport, expect cloudy skies and rainy days typical of autumn. 

**Friday** kicks off with overcast skies and persistent rain, hitting a high of 10°C and a low of 3°C. It’ll feel quite damp with 100% chance of rain and brisk winds at 21mph, so grab that umbrella!

**Saturday** looks similar, with cloudy conditions and a slight temperature bump to 12°C. Humidity will rise to 88% and there’s a 97% chance of rain. Winds ease slightly to 19mph, but still pack your waterproofs.

**Sunday** offers a bit of a break with partly cloudy skies, though rain is still possible. Temperatures will remain steady at around 12°C, with 84% chance of rain and winds at 22mph.

Commuters should brace for potential delays due to wet roads, and those with weekend plans might want to consider indoor activities. Local museums, cafes, and theatres could be nice spots to escape the dreary weather. Stay dry and make the most of the weekend!
