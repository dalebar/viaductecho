If you're up for a stroll around Manchester, the Castlefield Naturehood Trail is a cracking option! It's a lovely circular walk, about three miles long and step-free, making it wheelchair-friendly and perfect for parents with prams. You can easily find it on the Go Jauntly app. The route starts at Deansgate-Castlefield tram station, which has a lift, and takes you past the trendy Castlefield Viaduct, now a gorgeous sky garden by the National Trust. 

Along the way, you'll discover Roman Gardens, Saint John's Gardens, and learn about the area’s industrial history at Castlefield Basin. It’s a calm escape from the city bustle, and the circular path makes it a breeze to get back to where you started. 

Plus, the app has other great walks, like 'Moments of Joy in Manchester' and routes to the Trafford Centre. If you’re short on time, give the Manchester whistle-stop tour a go for a quick peek at the city's highlights. Get your walking shoes on and explore some of Manchester's hidden gems!
