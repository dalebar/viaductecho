The express train from Stockport to London is back on to accept passengers after some initial controversy over a timetable change that would have run it empty. The Avanti West Coast service, the quickest between Manchester and London, takes just under two hours, stopping only at Manchester and Stockport. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) had planned a change for 15 December, aiming to ease network congestion by moving an empty train during busy periods. However, this sparked backlash for leaving early commuters without a fast option and wasting resources. The ORR quickly reversed its decision, so the 7.09am service from Stockport to Euston will continue to welcome passengers.
