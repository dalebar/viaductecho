Chilling footage has emerged of Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove away from his Prestwich home before his horrific attack on the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue on Yom Kippur, October 2. The 35-year-old, in a black Kia Picanto, was seen calmly driving to the synagogue where he struck a volunteer guard with his car and then fatally stabbed a man. Al-Shamie, who wore a fake bomb vest, was shot dead by armed police shortly after. Tragically, two worshippers lost their lives—Adrian Daulby, struck by police gunfire, and Melvin Cravitz, who was outside when he was attacked. Previously a university dropout from Syria, Al-Shamie was out on bail facing serious charges and had been influenced by extremist ideologies. His ex-wife spoke of a three-year abusive relationship, revealing he tried to radicalise her by forcing her to watch extremist videos. It’s a deeply troubling incident that has shocked the local community.
