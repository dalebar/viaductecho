A couple from Stockport had a rough time flying back to Manchester with Ryanair after their flight from Faro Airport on September 16 was delayed due to a plane inspection. They stood on the tarmac with no info for nearly an hour before the flight was cancelled at midnight due to a fault. Ryanair promised hotels and refreshments, but when the couple and other passengers were taken back into the terminal, they found no accommodation availableâ€”just three staff members and an empty airport. With no shops open, they were left without food or drink for six hours, including vulnerable passengers who had to sit on the floor in the dark. When they finally boarded a replacement flight at 6am, chaos ensued with no seating manifest. To top it off, Ryanair charged full price for refreshments after a long night. The couple described the whole ordeal as treating them "like cattle" and declared they would never fly with Ryanair again. No comment has been made by the airline.
