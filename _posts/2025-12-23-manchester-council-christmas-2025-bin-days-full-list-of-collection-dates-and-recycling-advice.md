Manchester council has shared its bin collection schedule for the upcoming Christmas and New Year period, noting some changes due to the bank holidays. Collections on December 22, 23, 24, and 30 will remain unchanged, but Thursday collections (Christmas Day and New Year’s Day) will shift to the following Saturday and Friday, respectively. A full collection schedule is available on the council's website.

Residents can recycle real Christmas trees with some important conditions—remove all decorations and either book a charity collection or chop the tree for the green bin. Several drop-off sites are available for tree recycling throughout January. 

When it comes to recycling festive waste, cardboard and paper should go in the blue bin (boxes must be flattened), and leftover food can be disposed of in the green caddy, after removing packaging. Most plastics are acceptable in the brown bin, provided they are emptied first. However, some plastics and electrical items need to be placed in the grey bin or taken to the tip. Happy recycling, Mancs!
