A tragic stabbing attack outside a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur has left two people dead and the suspect shot by police. The incident occurred during one of the Jewish community's holiest days, leading to heightened fears among Jewish leaders who described it as an act of terrorism. The suspect reportedly drove a car towards congregants and was deemed a threat, leading to his shooting by armed police. Three others were seriously injured in the attack near the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Crumpsall. The Jewish Representative Council expressed their shock and sorrow, reflecting on the rising antisemitism linked to the broader conflict in Gaza, and extended support to those affected. They thanked Greater Manchester Police and the Community Security Trust for their rapid response. This solemn day is likened to Christmas for Christians, marked by fasting and reflection rather than celebration, making the violence all the more harrowing for the community.
