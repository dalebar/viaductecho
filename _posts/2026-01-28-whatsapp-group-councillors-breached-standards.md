Six Labour councillors in Greater Manchester have been suspended for breaching a code of conduct over offensive messages shared in a leaked WhatsApp group, dubbed "Trigger Me Timbers." The group included notable figures like former MP Andrew Gwynne and other councillors, and the messages contained racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, and even death threats. Complaints were raised by local residents, leading to an independent investigation that reviewed over 39,000 messages. Findings revealed severe misconduct, with some councillors making disparaging remarks about local residents and public figures. Councillors Warrington, Newton, and Jones have since apologised for their comments. The report's results are set to be considered by the Tameside Council standards committee on 2 February.
