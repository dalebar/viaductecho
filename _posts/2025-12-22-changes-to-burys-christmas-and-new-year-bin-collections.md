Bury Council's made some changes to waste collection over the Christmas and New Year. Brown bin collections will be paused from December 22 to January 4, and collection days for grey, green, and blue bins will shift for most households. Here’s the revised schedule: 

- Tuesday to Monday (Dec 23)
- Wednesday to Tuesday (Dec 24)
- Thursday to Wednesday (Dec 25)
- Friday to Monday (Dec 26)
- No changes on Tuesday and Wednesday (Dec 30-31)
- Thursday to Friday (Jan 1)
- Friday to Saturday (Jan 2)

Residents should put bins out by 7am, ensuring lids are closed. Extra waste can’t be collected, but can go to local waste recycling centres, open except Dec 25 and Jan 1. They encourage squashing rubbish to save space, and plastic pots can now go in the blue bin. Crews will work through the festive period but delays may occur due to winter weather or illness. If a bin’s missed, residents can report it online, and please park thoughtfully for easier access.
