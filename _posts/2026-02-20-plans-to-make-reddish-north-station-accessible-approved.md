Network Rail is set to partially redevelop Reddish North Station to enhance accessibility, responding to longstanding issues, particularly for disabled travellers. Current plans include a new footbridge with lifts, access stairs to both platforms, resurfaced pavements, more tactile paving, seating, a toilet, and public help points. Previous plans were stalled due to the station's locally listed footbridge, but a new Heritage Statement now allows for careful dismantling and relocation of the bridge. Local campaigner Nathaniel Yates expressed his delight after eight years of advocacy, while Stockport MP Navendu Mishra announced these long-awaited improvements as part of the Access for All Programme. Temporary facilities will be in place during construction, which is part of a broader initiative that aims for 63% of railway stations in Greater Manchester to have step-free access by 2028, backed by a £34m investment from the Greater Manchester Combined Authority.
