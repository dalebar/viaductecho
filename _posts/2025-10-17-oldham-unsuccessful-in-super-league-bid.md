York Knights and Toulouse Olympique are set to join an expanded 14-team Super League next season, having been chosen by an independent panel from nine applications. The panel, overseen by Lord Jonathan Caine and comprising several Rugby Football League (RFL) officials, deemed the two clubs ready for the top flight. York, finishing first in the Championship and securing the League Leaders' Shield and the 1895 Cup, has had a notable rise since its inception in the early 2000s. This promotion means the other Championship hopefuls—Oldham, Widnes Vikings, Doncaster, and London Broncos—will remain in an expanded second tier next season.
