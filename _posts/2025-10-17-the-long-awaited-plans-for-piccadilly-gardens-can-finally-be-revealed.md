A major revamp of Piccadilly Gardens is on the horizon, kicking off in the new year after the Christmas markets. Manchester’s long-discussed redesign will focus on enhancing green space by removing the fountains, expanding the playground, and reintroducing flowers with public input. The area aims to improve safety, with a dedicated police presence working alongside a revamped space for events and transport links. Expected completion of the initial phase is within 12 months, with more plans in the pipeline, including a new transport hub by the end of the decade. Councillors are keen to make Piccadilly Gardens a spot Mancunians can be proud of again, while recent police efforts target reducing crime and anti-social behaviour. This overhaul is seen as a vital step to revitalise a beloved space in the city, responding to community desires for cleanliness and safety. Overall, it promises to make a lasting impact on the area’s future.
