A vacant building in Stockport town centre is being revamped into an artists' hub known as GRIT Studios. Located at Kingston House on Kingston Street, this space will offer affordable studios for around 30 local creatives, boosting the area's arts scene. GRIT has previously operated a studio near Canal Street and aims to support grassroots talent in the region. John Macaulay from GRIT expressed excitement over this new venture, highlighting the importance of providing accessible creative spaces amid rising costs in city centres. Stockport Council is backing the initiative, viewing it as a chance to enliven the building before its eventual demolition for the Stockport 8 project. Additionally, a mural will be painted nearby to enhance the environment. The council emphasises community support and the need for affordable options for local artists during the town centreâ€™s regeneration.
