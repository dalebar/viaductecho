There’s an exciting blues festival happening at the Spinning Top and Garrick Theatre from 20-21 September! With over 30 acts lined up, headlining is local blues legend Norman Beaker, a 2017 Blues Hall of Fame inductee. Other acts include ZZ Not, Stevie Williams & The Most Wanted, and Mandy's Angels. It’s kicking off at midday on both days, and tickets are pretty reasonable at £28 in advance or £30.80 with a booking fee—about a quid per act!
