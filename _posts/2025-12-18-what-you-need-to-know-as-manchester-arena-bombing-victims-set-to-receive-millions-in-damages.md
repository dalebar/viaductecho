Victims of the Manchester Arena bombing are set to receive millions in damages, with 16 claimants—including children—awarded around £20 million after a hearing at the Civil Justice Centre. An additional 352 claimants will also receive undisclosed amounts. This settlement follows an agreement between the victims' lawyers and several defendants, including Greater Manchester Police and arena operators SMG. The organisations involved have issued apologies to the bereaved families and survivors, acknowledging their failures on the night of the attack on May 22, 2017. They've also committed to implementing changes to prevent such tragedies in the future.
