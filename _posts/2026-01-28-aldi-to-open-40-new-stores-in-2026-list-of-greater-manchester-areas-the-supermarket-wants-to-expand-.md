Aldi's set to open 40 new stores across the UK this year as part of a £370 million investment, which is a chunk of their £1.6 billion two-year investment plan. This is aimed at hitting 1,500 stores in the UK by 2026. While exact locations for the new stores haven’t been confirmed, they’ve mentioned eight potential spots in Greater Manchester, including areas like Manchester, Wigan, and Bolton. Aldi's boss, Giles Hurley, emphasised their commitment to providing quality groceries at affordable prices and filling gaps in areas lacking an Aldi. Overall, it looks like a solid move to expand their presence up and down the UK.
