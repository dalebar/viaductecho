Rochdale is set to embrace the padel trend with the launch of the Rochdale Padel Club, aiming to introduce six new courts, four of which will be covered for weather protection. The facility will feature a clubhouse with changing rooms, a caf√©, and a terrace, situated near Rochdale Cricket Club. Padel, a racket sport blending tennis and squash, is easy to learn and encourages community connection. Jordan Ingoe, the club's founder, brings experience from around the UK, hoping to create a welcoming space for all ages. Local figures like Eddie Hamilton from Rochdale Sports Club are excited about the new addition, believing it will enhance the sports scene in the area. Padel is known for its physical benefits, providing a full-body workout and improving overall health. This project promises not only to promote a new sport but to strengthen community ties in Rochdale.
