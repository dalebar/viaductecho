Drivers in Hindley town centre, Wigan, are facing serious traffic chaos this Christmas Day due to all traffic lights being out at a busy junction. The crossroads, where Liverpool Road meets Market Street and Atherton Road meets Wigan Road, is seeing heavy congestion. Councillor James Palmer, representing Hindley Green, took to Facebook to warn motorists, sharing footage of the situation. He reported that an engineer from GMP is on the way to fix the issue. Palmer advised everyone to approach the junction with extra caution. Merry Christmas!
