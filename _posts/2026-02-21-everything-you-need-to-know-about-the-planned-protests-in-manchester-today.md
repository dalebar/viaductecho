Today, February 21, far-right group Britain First is holding a 'March for Remigration' in Manchester city centre, beginning on Store Street behind Piccadilly Station. In response, multiple counter protests are organised, including Resist Britain First and Stand Up To Racism, which will gather in Piccadilly Gardens at 11:30am; independent MP Jeremy Corbyn is set to speak. Another counter demo from Resist Britain First will take place at Sackville Gardens starting at 11:15am. Greater Manchester Police have issued a section 34 dispersal order to manage the situation, allowing officers to remove people from specific areas for up to 48 hours to curb potential crime and anti-social behaviour. It’s going to be a bustling day, especially with Manchester City’s home match against Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium at 8pm, all while Piccadilly station is effectively shut down until February 22 due to significant refurbishments, leading to cancelled services and rail replacement buses.
