Nathan Taggart, a 40-year-old bargain hunter from Bury, made an unexpected find at a jumble sale when he discovered a sex toy in a waterproof ORTLIEB messenger bag that he bought for £3. Known for his thrifting adventures, Nathan recorded a video of his discovery, expressing his shock and disgust as he held up the item with a plastic bag as a glove. He noted that he usually finds things like loose change and receipts but had never encountered anything like this before. Keen to return the item to its rightful owner, he attempted to post on a local community page but was met with restrictions. Reactions from viewers ranged from disbelief to humour, with one commenting it was the strangest thing to come from a donation. Nathan's quirky find has certainly sparked a bit of chatter, adding a cheeky twist to his thrifting tales!
