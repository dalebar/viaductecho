Commuters in Greater Manchester are facing a rough few days as bus strikes disrupt services from September 19 to September 22. With two-thirds of bus routes affected, many missed medical appointments or found themselves stranded at bus stops, leading to increased taxi costs. The strike is due to a pay dispute involving staff from Stagecoach, Metroline, and First. Some areas like Bolton and Wigan still have services running, but key transport corridors like Wilmslow Road and Oxford Road were unusually quiet. Passengers encountered lengthy waits and confusion at stops, with many turning to taxis or rideshares, which have surged in demand. Notable experiences include a mother struggling to get her ill son home and a trainee dietician opting for an Uber instead of her usual bus. Middleton bus station was particularly hit hard, with only a handful of services available. Overall, the strikes have thrown a spanner in the works for many, highlighting the heavy reliance on bus transport in Manchester.
