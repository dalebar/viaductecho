Two football clubs, Bilston Town FC and Droylsden FC, have suspended supporters involved in violence during a recent non-league match in Wolverhampton. Despite the fighting, no arrests were made, and police were called to the scene. The clubs are conducting their own investigations, in collaboration with the police and the Football Association, whilst monitoring social media videos of the incident. They stated that the suspensions will remain until inquiries are complete, emphasising zero tolerance for any form of disorder. Police are gathering evidence, including eyewitness statements and reviewing footage, to determine what happened during the FA Vase tie.
