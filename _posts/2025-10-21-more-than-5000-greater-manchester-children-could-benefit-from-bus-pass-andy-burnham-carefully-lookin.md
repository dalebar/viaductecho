Over 5,000 kids in Greater Manchester might get a free school bus pass, as proposed by mayor Andy Burnham. Recent data shows 5,397 children living in temporary housing are missing school due to a little-known rule: they only qualify for free bus travel if they’re over two miles from school and no suitable school is nearby. This creates a tough situation for homeless parents—either pay for transport or move their kids to new schools, away from friends and familiar staff. The Manchester Evening News is advocating for a bus pass for these children if they live more than 30 minutes' walk from school. Burnham is considering the proposal but needs to ensure it can be funded sustainably. New statistics from a Freedom of Information request highlight the scale of the issue, with 172,000 children in temporary accommodation across the UK, which raises concerns about their basic rights.
