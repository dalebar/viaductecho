This morning felt a bit like déjà vu in Manchester with party conference season upon us and yet another northern rail project stalling. At the Conservative Party conference, Rishi Sunak spoke about the HS2 line, which has faced setbacks since transport secretary Louise Haigh’s remarks last year about funding for the Liverpool-Manchester line being scarce. The latest disappointment came with Keir Starmer postponing an expected announcement on Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), leading to frustrations from local leaders like Mayor Andy Burnham and Manchester council leader Bev Craig. But there's a glimmer of hope! Sunak expressed strong support for NPR, which aims to connect Manchester and Liverpool with a high-speed line. The plan has seen delays due to cost analyses but adds an airport stop, and officials believe an announcement could be imminent. NPR not only promises faster travel but also lays the groundwork for bigger transport improvements in the region, including a potential underground Manchester Piccadilly, which could free up city centre land for new developments. Overall, while the project is paused, it's not abandoned, and Greater Manchester has a lot riding on its future.
