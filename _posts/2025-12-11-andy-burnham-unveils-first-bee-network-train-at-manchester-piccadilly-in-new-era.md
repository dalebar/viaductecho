Andy Burnham has kicked off a bright new chapter for Greater Manchester's railways, unveiling the Bee Network Rail initiative. Posing by a yellow Bee Network train at Manchester Piccadilly, he promised a more integrated transport system, expected to work like an Oyster card for commuters. The first two lines—Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge, and Piccadilly to Glossop—will start on December 13, 2026, with more services rolling out over the next few years. Burnham is pushing for a unified yellow livery for the trains, unlike the newly revealed Union Jack design by Great British Rail. He emphasised the need for collaboration among various stakeholders to make this vision a reality. The transport commissioner acknowledged the challenges of integrating the system, whilst Northern's managing director highlighted their commitment to delivering more reliable services. Burnham's enthusiasm for a more efficient and affordable transport network shows a collaborative approach to improving Greater Manchester's ageing infrastructure.
