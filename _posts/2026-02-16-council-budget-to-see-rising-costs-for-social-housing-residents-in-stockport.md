Stockport Council announced a 4.8% rent increase for social housing and a 5% rise for shared ownership properties. This hike, along with increased service charges, is part of the council's preparation for the annual Housing Revenue Account (HRA) Budget. With over 14,000 social housing properties in Stockport, rents are still significantly cheaper—up to 77% lower—than private rentals, which now average over £1,000 per month. Councillors noted that despite these increases, Stockport Homes offers some of the lowest social rents in the region, crucial for supporting residents. The council's strategy ensures continued investment in housing while also establishing a hardship fund for those struggling to pay. Cllr Jake Austin stressed the importance of balancing affordable rents with necessary income for maintaining and improving housing stock.
