Andy Burnham's been making waves lately, even though he's ruffled quite a few feathers. While he’s popular compared to Keir Starmer, who seems to be losing support, Burnham isn't aiming for the leadership role just yet—partly because he’s not an MP. However, he’s been vocal about his policy ideas leading up to the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, which has raised eyebrows and stirred some tension, particularly with No 10. His approval ratings have taken a hit recently, dropping nine points, although they still outweigh Starmer's. Some local leaders worry Burnham’s outspokenness could jeopardise investment in Greater Manchester. Still, supporters like Neal Lawson argue for calm and see Burnham as a strong leader for the party’s future. While he’s not officially in a race for leadership, he’s certainly keeping the conversation going, leaving many speculating about what’s next.
