In the Gorton and Denton byelection, pensioners Sheila Burns and Joan Cook are set to support Reform UK candidate Matthew Goodwin, who aims to be the first MP for the party in Greater Manchester. The campaign heavily focuses on immigration, with slogans urging to "stop the boats" and prioritise locals over immigrants. Many residents express concerns about crime and refuse to back Labour, feeling they're ignoring working-class issues. Alternately, some are considering voting Green due to dissatisfaction with Labour's stance and leadership.

Disillusionment with all political parties is palpable, as many voters cite corruption and ineffective policies, leading to lower election turnout. While Labour supporters hope for a win, several suggest a rise in Green votes could cut into their support. The contest is complicated by community concerns over poverty, housing, and public services. Overall, there’s a blend of anger and hope among voters in this fragmented constituency, each awaiting change while grappling with complex issues that inform their picks in the upcoming election.
