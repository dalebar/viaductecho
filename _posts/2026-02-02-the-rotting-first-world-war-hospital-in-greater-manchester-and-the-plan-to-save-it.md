Basford House, a crumbling former WWI hospital in Old Trafford, might get a new lease of life as six two-bed flats. Built in 1860 and converted into a hospital during the war, it treated patients until 2015 but has since suffered neglect and damage. Developer Promenade Firswood Ltd plans to overhaul the decaying structure, which has partially collapsed, but notes the exterior remains sound for renovation. Alongside the flats, they aim to build 29 new houses on the cleared land around Basford House—mostly three and four-bed homes. However, none will be classified as affordable. Earlier plans for a larger development faced criticism from Trafford Council for being too imposing next to the historic site. The new proposal also includes 76 parking spaces and 106 bicycle spaces.
