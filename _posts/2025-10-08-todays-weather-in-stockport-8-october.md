Wednesday's weather in Stockport is set to be a bit of a mix. Expect rain early on, clearing to partly cloudy skies as the day goes on. Temperatures will range from a mild 11°C to 14°C, but high humidity and brisk winds will give it a chilly feel. With a 100% chance of rain in the morning, don’t forget your waterproofs if you’re heading out!

The morning showers might make roads slippery, so allow a bit more time if you’re commuting or on public transport—an umbrella or raincoat would be a smart choice too. By midday, things should improve a bit, making for a refreshing walk in the breeze.

Dress in layers to keep comfy; start with waterproofs and switch to a light jacket as the skies clear. Best to focus on indoor activities in the morning, then enjoy the outdoors later when it’s nicer.
