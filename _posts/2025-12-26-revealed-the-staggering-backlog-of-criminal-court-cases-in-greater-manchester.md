There's a significant backlog in criminal court cases in Greater Manchester, with the open caseload rising from 76,957 nationally to 79,619 in just six months. Locally, the Crown Court backlog has jumped from around 2,000 to nearly 4,900 cases between 2019 and 2025. Notably, over 20,000 cases have been stuck for over a year, showing a worrying trend. The time for resolving cases has also increased, with serious offences like sexual crimes taking around 420 days to reach trial.

Sarah Sackman, Minister for Courts and Legal Services, highlighted that this situation is unacceptable for victims, who are waiting far too long for justice. The rise in cases is particularly steep for sexual offences and violent crimes. As the backlogs climb, the government has proposed reforms, including potentially removing juries from certain trials to expedite the process. This issue stems partly from previous austerity measures, which led to court closures and a strain on the justice system. Without fundamental changes, the backlog could hit 100,000 by 2028, leaving victims and suspects facing years of uncertainty.
