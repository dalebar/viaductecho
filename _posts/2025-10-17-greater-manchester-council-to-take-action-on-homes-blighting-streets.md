Bury Council's cabinet has approved a policy to enforce the sale of long-standing empty properties to address housing shortages. If property owners owe the council over £1,000, the council can sell the property. This move aims to tackle problems caused by empty homes affecting nearby residents and to recover debts. The policy might also apply for debts below £1,000 if the empty property's condition severely impacts neighbours. The council highlighted that enforced sales could help bring these homes back into use, either through auction or private sale, while covering the costs of works and legal fees from the sale proceeds. Any leftover money would then go to the former property owner. It's all part of their strategy to make better use of resources and support local housing needs.
