Bolton council is rolling out new traffic restrictions outside eight primary schools as part of its expanding ‘School Street’ programme to enhance safety for pupils and their parents during drop-off and pick-up times. Following a successful pilot at St Bede’s CofE Primary School, the council has secured an additional £81,600 from Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), boosting the total funding to £120,000. The targeted schools will operate under an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO) for six to nine months, allowing time for monitoring before any permanent changes are made. The restrictions will include exemptions for residents and emergency services, supported by signage, physical barriers, and trained marshals to ensure smooth operation. This initiative, developed in partnership with TfGM, aims to promote safer, healthier, and more sustainable school travel, with a completion target set for July 31, 2026.
