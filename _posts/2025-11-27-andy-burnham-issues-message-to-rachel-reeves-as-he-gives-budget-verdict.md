Andy Burnham's feeling chuffed about the recent budget, giving a nod to Rachel Reeves for paying attention to Greater Manchester's needs. He’s particularly upbeat about the green light for a tourist tax, which he’s pushed for ages. This levy will apply to overnight stays in hotels and B&Bs, with the cash going towards boosting public transport. He also praised the government for freezing rail fares and ending the two-child benefit cap, which he believes has unfairly burdened larger families and pushed them into poverty. While he welcomed significant funding for Greater Manchester and the commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail, he urged clarity on its specifics—seeing it as vital for growth. Overall, Burnham’s quite positive, viewing the budget as a stepping stone to solid growth for the region in the coming decade. He stressed the importance of affordable public transport, especially through the Bee Network, and highlighted the urgent need to support families struggling under the weight of housing pressures.
