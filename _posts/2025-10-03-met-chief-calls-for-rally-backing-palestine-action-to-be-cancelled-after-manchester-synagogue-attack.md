Following a recent terror attack at a Manchester synagogue, the head of the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, has called for the cancellation of a Palestine Action rally planned for Trafalgar Square. The attack, which resulted in two deaths and several injuries, has heightened fears within Jewish communities. With over 1,000 people expected to attend the demonstration tomorrow, Rowley argues that police resources would be better focused on community safety rather than managing a large gathering in support of a proscribed organisation. He emphasised that the timing of the protest, shortly after the attack, is insensitive and could exacerbate tensions. Although they cannot legally ban the protest, police are prepared to deploy additional officers to ensure public safety and address any law-breaking. There's also increased concern for Muslim communities, as fears of hate crimes rise. The Met has stated it will enhance police presence around both Jewish and Muslim sites to provide reassurance. Overall, the police aim to maintain safety amidst heightened community anxieties in London.
