On a pivotal night in Manchester, local leaders faced off to advocate for the HS2 project. While Andy Burnham and his crew were sidelined, Andy Street, the former Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, found himself in a rather unusual meeting with then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in his hotel room. Street recalled how he negotiated key concessions regarding HS2's routes, particularly securing Euston as the starting point rather than Old Oak Common. However, he felt his outspoken efforts ultimately cost him his mayoral position, losing by a narrow margin to Labour's Richard Parker. Post-election, Street and Burnham banded together to propose a different plan, pushing for a privately funded railway line north of Handsacre to ease the capacity issues faced by the West Coast Mainline and M6. Although the future of Northern Powerhouse Rail remains uncertain, a government announcement is anticipated before the autumn budget. Street expressed pride in his actions, arguing they benefitted local residents, even if it led to his political downfall.
