Gary 'Mani' Mounfield's funeral took place on December 22 at Manchester Cathedral, drawing friends, family, and music legends to pay their respects. The Stone Roses bassist passed away peacefully at 63 from respiratory issues linked to emphysema. His coffin, adorned with the iconic 'Bye Bye, Badman' artwork by John Squire, was carried inside by close mates, including Ian Brown and Bobby Gillespie, who shared heartfelt memories. 

High-profile attendees included Sir David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Weller, and Liam Gallagher, along with many fans who lined the streets to honour the Mancunian icon. Mani's death came shortly after losing his beloved wife Imelda, and he is survived by their twin sons, Gene and George. The emotional send-off reflected Mani's significant impact on music and the community, with cheers erupting as his cortege travelled from Stockport to the cathedral. It truly was a touching farewell for a beloved figure in the music scene.
