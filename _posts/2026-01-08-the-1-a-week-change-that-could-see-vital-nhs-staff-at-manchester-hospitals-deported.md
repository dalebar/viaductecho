Plans to change UK visa and settlement rules could drive thousands of migrant NHS and social care workers out of the UK or leave them vulnerable to exploitation, warn health leaders. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's proposal to extend the qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain from five to ten years has sparked outrage, particularly in Greater Manchester, where a significant portion of social care staff are on visas. Mayor Andy Burnham highlighted the hardship faced by these workers, lamenting the potential for exploitation and job insecurity.

The changes could wreak havoc on the NHS, which relies heavily on these workers, especially as waiting lists remain a pressing concern. Many migrant workers report having faced extortionate fees to obtain employment and inadequate living conditions. A recent survey found alarming statistics on the lack of employment contracts and overcrowded accommodations among migrant care workers.

Local leaders are calling for advocacy and solutions, emphasising that the current proposals threaten not only the workers but also the broader healthcare system, which faces critical staffing challenges.
