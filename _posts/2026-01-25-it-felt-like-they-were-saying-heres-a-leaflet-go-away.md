Dancing with Dementia, a beloved community group in Greater Manchester, shares the personal journey of Lesley Fisher, who struggled with her sister Jean's dementia diagnosis from 2014. After losing Jean, Lesley dedicated herself to supporting others facing similar challenges, highlighting the poor respite care for both carers and those living with dementia. She and fellow trustee Elaine shared their frustrations with healthcare professionals, often feeling dismissed during their struggles. Lesley also pointed out the stigma surrounding dementia, with many, like her sister, reluctant to acknowledge their condition. Current concerns suggest over half a million undiagnosed cases in the UK by 2040, prompting new guidelines urging GPs to reassess patients. Despite the challenges, Dancing with Dementia serves as a crucial support network, with many families crediting the group with transforming their lives. They have gained recognition, winning the King's Award in 2024 and the 'I Love Manchester Award', proudly showcased at Swinton Gateway, where they help numerous care homes and hospitals across Greater Manchester.
