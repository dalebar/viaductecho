David Taylor, now 85, kicked off his referee journey in 1960 after a serious knee injury cut short his amateur playing days. Inspired by a friend's suggestion, the Bury native started officiating in the Bury Amateur League and has since logged an impressive 66 seasons. His family believes this might be a world record, and they’re pushing for recognition. Throughout his career, David has witnessed football evolve, though he feels many refereeing challenges remain unchanged. He admits that the dissent from players has always been tough, but he’s learned to adapt his approach over time. While he sees some rule changes as detrimental, like handball regulations, he appreciates others for keeping the game flowing. He's even had his share of incidents, including a punch thrown by an irate player. Despite comments on his age, David takes it in stride, relying on his keen eye over raw fitness. Now officiating in the Lancashire Amateur League and the Manchester League, he enjoys the camaraderie and hopes to continue for a few more seasons. His dedication is evident, having worked at the Manchester Evening News for over 30 years and still relishing the challenges of grassroots football.
