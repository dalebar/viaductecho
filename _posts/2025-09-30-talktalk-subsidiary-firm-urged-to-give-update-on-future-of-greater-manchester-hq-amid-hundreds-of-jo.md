Platform X Communications (PXC), a part of the TalkTalk Group based in Salford Quays, has announced plans to cut 350 jobs due to a major restructuring, while creating around 70 new roles, resulting in a net loss of 280 positions. The company’s headquarters, located at Soapworks near MediaCity, is still slated to remain operational despite concerns about job losses. Salford MP Rebecca Long-Bailey has called for clarity on how many Salford positions are affected and the support available for staff. She emphasises the importance of protecting skilled jobs in the area as PXC has been a key player in Salford’s tech economy. A PXC spokesperson mentioned the firm is constantly reviewing its operations to stay efficient and focused on innovation and service delivery. Concerns regarding the long-term plans for the site persist, and Salford council has also been approached for a comment.
