Andy Burnham's office is facing challenges over the "Places for Everyone" development masterplan, which has been in the works for 11 years. Originally crafted with nine Greater Manchester boroughs on board, the plan's intent to develop green belt land has sparked controversy and legal scrutiny. A legal test introduced by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) reduced the list of protected green belt areas from 49 to 19, which campaigners now argue was a misstep in law. They claim the new criteria constrained inspectors' decisions and limited their ability to consider exceptional circumstances for green belt additions. While the GMCA and associated lawyers maintain that the new test was accepted by all parties involved, the campaigners allege they received insufficient time to respond. A judge has yet to rule on the case, but regardless of the outcome, the "Places for Everyone" plan will continue, prolonging the dispute surrounding it. Burnham's office is left in a state of anxious anticipation about the plan's future amid an ongoing saga.
