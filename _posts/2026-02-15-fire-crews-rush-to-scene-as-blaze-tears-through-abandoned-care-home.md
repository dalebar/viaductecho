Emergency services are dealing with a fire at a derelict building, believed to be the former Avondale Nursing Home in Eccles, which broke out around 7.15 pm on February 14. New Lane has been shut off, and the public is advised to steer clear of the area. Fire crews from Salford, Agecroft, and Eccles are on-site, working hard to bring the blaze under control using breathing apparatus and hoses. Thankfully, no injuries have been reported. The Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service is currently damping down hot spots and ensuring the area is safe. If you're in the vicinity, it's best to find alternative routes.
