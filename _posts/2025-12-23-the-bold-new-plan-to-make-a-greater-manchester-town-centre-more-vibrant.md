Tameside town hall has greenlit an ambitious plan to transform Denton into a greener, safer, and more vibrant place, with nearly £17m in improvements set to begin before March 2026. Funded by the council's Levelling Up pot and Transport for Greater Manchester, the initiative focuses on safer travel routes, enhancing walkways for kids headed to school, and planting trees along ‘green corridors’. Shaped by community feedback, the plan includes a mix of quick wins and longer-term goals, like new pedestrian and cycle routes and improved connections between key areas. Plans are also in place for traffic calming measures, redesigned road junctions, and transforming streets into child-friendly zones. With excitement from local leaders, the council sees this as a unique opportunity to revitalise Denton, ensuring it reflects residents' desires for better public spaces and transport links. Phased delivery will continue until 2028, with efforts underway to secure additional funding for further enhancements.
