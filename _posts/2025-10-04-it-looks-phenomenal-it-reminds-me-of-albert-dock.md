Exciting news for Bolton! The £100m regeneration of the Church Wharf area has been approved, bringing new life to this long-vacant site. Watson Homes will build 418 homes, a 130-room hotel, and commercial spaces, creating a vibrant community for over 1,000 residents. Bolton council leader Nick Peel highlighted the significance, calling it a key development for the town's future as it progresses alongside other local projects. 

The site, near the River Croal, will include a public plaza named Churchbank Square, restaurants, shops, and leisure facilities, and features a mix of housing options, including affordable units. Planning committee members praised the design, noting its homage to Bolton’s industrial heritage. Watson Homes is keen to create a neighbourhood that fosters community, with construction set to start in 2025 and completion expected by 2029. This is seen as a pivotal moment for Bolton, marking a new chapter in its regeneration journey.
