Former Manchester United player Gordon McQueen, who passed away at 70, reportedly linked his dementia to his extensive history of heading footballs during his career. His daughter, Hayley, recounted that after turning 60, McQueen exhibited personality changes, feeling unwell mentally and physically, despite being active during his playing days. He was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2021 and exhibited symptoms like swallowing and balance issues.

After his death in June 2023, the family donated his brain for research, revealing evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) along with vascular dementia, but no signs of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Professor Willie Stewart, who examined the brain, noted a strong correlation between CTE and repeated head injuries, emphasising that McQueen's football experiences likely contributed to his condition. The inquest, indicating a complex relationship between CTE and vascular dementia, continues.
