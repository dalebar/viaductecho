Manchester Road in Cheadle has reopened after being closed due to a gas leak from January 26. The road, a key route into south Manchester, faced significant traffic disruptions. Cadent, the gas company, confirmed that workers had to conduct essential repairs after detecting a gas smell and subsequently discovering a leak. The closure impacted drivers turning from High Street and Stockport Road and required bus services to be redirected. The road reopened on February 2 after repairs were completed, with Cadent thanking the public for their patience during the disruption. In addition, Stockport Council has started roadworks on Stockport Road nearby, which will involve nightly closures from 8pm to 5am and are expected to last about a week, with arrangements made for affected bus services. Residents are reminded to report any gas leaks by calling the National Gas Emergency Service.
