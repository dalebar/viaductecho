A viral TikTok featuring kids Renée and Ivan has stirred up a lively debate among Greater Manchester locals about how to pronounce "Play-Doh." In the clip, Renée corrects her dad Nyle's Bolton accent from "pleh daw" to "play dow," cracking him up. The video has since amassed over 260,000 views, drawing comments from across the North as users weighed in on the pronunciation differences between Bolton and Manchester accents. Participants noted the subtle variances, claiming "Bolton = play daw" and "Manc = play doww," while others playfully sided with the kids. The discussion even spilled over onto Reddit, where users highlighted how accents can shift quite dramatically across short distances in Greater Manchester, with studies confirming distinct accent groups like 'Manc' in the city centre and 'Lancashire' in Bolton and nearby areas. Whether folks say "pleh daw" or "play dow," this clip has sparked a charming revisit of regional dialect pride!
