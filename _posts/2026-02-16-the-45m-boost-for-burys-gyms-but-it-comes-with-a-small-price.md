Bury Council is pumping £4.5m into upgrading fitness and leisure spaces in Ramsbottom and the town centre, focusing on modernising the facilities on Stubbins Lane and Bolton Street until 2030. The upgrades will involve repairs, maintenance, and some redecorating to keep things up to scratch. However, residents will see a rise in membership costs—from £26 to £29.25 per month—due to a £14m budget gap the council faces by 2026/27. This increase is seen as necessary to cut back on the council’s £1m annual subsidy for the leisure centres. Councillor Tamoor Tariq emphasises the importance of these facilities in promoting health and community interaction. The aim is to gradually increase prices by 10% over three years, bringing them closer to Manchester’s rates while keeping all leisure centres operational. Plus, a new £40m community hub in Radcliffe, featuring pools and gym spaces, is set to open later this year.
