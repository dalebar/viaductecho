Phil Neville and his family are rallying support for a campaign aiming to raise £1.1m to build a cinema for patients at Manchester Royal Infirmary. The Nevilless are passionate about this initiative, due to their personal experience with the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, which supported them when their daughter Isabella was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Julie shared how the hospital meant everything to them and helped them through tough times, allowing Isabella to thrive. The Manchester MediCinema Appeal has already raised £579,000, reaching halfway towards its goal, and aims to create a 50-seat accessible cinema for patients and families. This will offer a much-needed escape, with up to 260 films screened annually, all at no cost to the NHS. Phil emphasised that every donation helps, no matter the size, encouraging everyone to contribute to this worthwhile cause. If you’re interested in getting involved or donating, check out the campaign's website.
