Hey everyone, just wanted to wish you all a very merry Christmas and say thanks for sticking with us this year! It's been almost three years since Stockport Nub News kicked off, and what a ride it’s been, covering all sorts from new openings to major events. Your clicks and shares mean the world to us. Let's raise a virtual toast to Stockport and all the connections we share, no matter how small. Whether you're in the borough or have moved away, those memories of our town unite us in a lovely little way. Wishing you all the best for the new year. Thanks for reading! Cheers, Alasdair
