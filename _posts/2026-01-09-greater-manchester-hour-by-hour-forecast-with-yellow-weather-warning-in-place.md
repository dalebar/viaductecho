Storm Goretti's hit Greater Manchester with snow, wind, and rain, causing travel disruptions. Luckily, the region escaped the worst, unlike the South West and Midlands, which faced harsher conditions. A Met Office yellow weather warning for snow is active until noon, with forecasts indicating heavy snowfall could lead to more travel difficulties later on. Certain areas, like Oldham and Rochdale, have already seen significant snow, making it tricky on roads like the A460 in Saddleworth. For today, expect cloudy, cold, and wet weather with sporadic rain or sleet, and some snow, especially in the hills. Tonight should be mostly dry but watch out for frost and ice!
