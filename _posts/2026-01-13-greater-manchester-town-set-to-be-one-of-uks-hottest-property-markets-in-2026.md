Wigan is being highlighted as one of the UK's up-and-coming property hotspots for 2026, according to Zoopla’s recent data. Various indicators, like home affordability and sales speed, were analysed across 120 UK postal areas to predict housing market trends. Scotland dominates the top ranks, with Motherwell at the forefront, while Wigan stands out as the only English area making the cut. With an average house price of £175,800, Wigan has low unsold properties and quick sales, indicating solid growth potential. Other promising areas in England include Liverpool and Stoke-on-Trent. Meanwhile, southern regions, including London, are expected to see slower price growth due to rising mortgage rates and property taxes. Richard Donnell from Zoopla emphasised the importance of understanding local market conditions when making buying or selling decisions, stating there are still decent opportunities across the country, particularly in northern England.
