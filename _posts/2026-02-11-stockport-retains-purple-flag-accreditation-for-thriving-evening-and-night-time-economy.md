Stockport is buzzing after retaining its Purple Flag accreditation, marking its commitment to a lively and safe evening and night-time economy. This accolade reflects the town's mix of entertainment, dining, and culture, ensuring a welcoming atmosphere for both residents and visitors. Key highlights include the popular Stockroom, which draws around 100,000 visits a month, and the LSAVI initiative that trains local venues to enhance safety and security. The success comes from collaborative efforts between the council, businesses, and community organisations, creating a vibrant town centre where people feel confident to live and socialise. In the past year, Stockport has welcomed 10 new bars and restaurants, hosted popular events like Foodie Friday, and even clinched titles like Foodie Neighbourhood of the Year. Since first earning Purple Flag status in 2019, Stockport has consistently demonstrated its dedication to improving the night-time experience.
