CCTV footage showed a chaotic protest on Wilmslow Road, also known as the Curry Mile, in Rusholme on January 20. The demonstration began peacefully but turned disorderly when some protesters started damaging property and clashing with police. The protest, related to the conflict involving Syrian forces, drew large crowds, with footage capturing significant movement and noise as people waved flags and ran across the road. The police had to issue a Section 34 dispersal order, allowing them to clear the area as vehicles were blocked, and public transport was diverted. Although damage was reported and items were thrown at officers, no arrests were made at the scene. Superintendent Stephen Wiggins mentioned that police aim to support peaceful protests but would act firmly against disorderly behaviour. The crowd dispersed by around 10pm, and police are now reviewing CCTV to identify those involved, encouraging anyone with information to reach out.
