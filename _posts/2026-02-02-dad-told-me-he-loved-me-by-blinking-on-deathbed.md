A teenager named Wiktoria has shared a touching story about her father, Emanuel, who passed away after suffering a cardiac arrest at Salford Crescent station in June 2025. After being revived for 45 minutes by an off-duty police officer, Wiktoria cherished their final communication, where Emanuel blinked three times to express his love. Despite not being able to speak, they found a way to connect through blinks. Wiktoria described this moment as a precious gift she will carry for life. 

About seven months later, she and her mother Claudia met Ch Insp Michael Parker, the officer who saved Emanuel's life for those crucial 16 extra days. They expressed immense gratitude, calling him their "angel," as he provided them invaluable time with Emanuel before his passing. Parker humbly acknowledged his role, stating he acted on instinct. He was later honoured with a commendation for his actions.
