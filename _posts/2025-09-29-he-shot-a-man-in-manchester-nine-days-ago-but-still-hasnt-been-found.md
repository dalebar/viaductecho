A gunman who shot a 22-year-old man in the foot in Gorton, east Manchester, has yet to be caught after nine days. The incident occurred on September 20 around 12:15am when police responded to reports of gunfire near Ryder Brow pocket park. Luckily, the victim only suffered a graze after officers found a bullet lodged in his shoe. Greater Manchester Police described the shooter as an "unknown man," and forensic teams searched the area thoroughly. This incident is among four recent shootings in Greater Manchester that week, with the Gorton shooting considered unrelated to the others, two of which were linked and took place in Newton Heath. There was also a separate shooting in Ashton-in-Makerfield where only blanks were fired.
