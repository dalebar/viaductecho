Two sites in Greater Manchester are set to be among the first 12 'new towns' announced by Labour, aimed at tackling the housing crisis by building 1.5 million homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed will share these plans during his speech at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool. One key project is the Victoria North development, which will add 15,000 homes between Manchester city centre and Collyhurst, focusing heavily on affordable housing. Progress is already visible as Collyhurst Village's first council estate is complete. Adlington in Cheshire is another site that will cater to the Greater Manchester area. Other promising locations include Tempsford, Crews Hill, and Leeds Southbank. Labour's initiative, inspired by past housing booms, aims to restore the hope of home ownership, with the establishment of a 'New Towns Unit' to streamline these projects. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasised the goal of making home ownership a reality for families, reflecting Labour's commitment to revitalising Britain through these new developments.
