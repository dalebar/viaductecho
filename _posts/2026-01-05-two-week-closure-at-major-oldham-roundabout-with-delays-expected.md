The Big Lamp Roundabout in Oldham will face road and lane closures from January 5 to January 18, causing delays for drivers in and out of Shaw. These closures are part of crucial safety works by Cadent Gas Limited, who are replacing some very old gas pipes, some dated back to 1900, along Church Road and the roundabout. Church Road will be closed until January 16, while Manchester Road, Oldham Road, and Crompton Way will have lane restrictions and temporary traffic lights. Cadent emphasised that the work is essential for public safety and maintaining gas supplies. The local council has confirmed the road closures will be in effect for about two weeks, and they appreciate everyone's understanding amid the disruption.
