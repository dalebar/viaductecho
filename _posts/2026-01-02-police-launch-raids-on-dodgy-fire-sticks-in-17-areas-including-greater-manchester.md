Greater Manchester is among 17 UK regions cracking down on modified Amazon Fire Sticks, which allow access to premium content unlawfully. Police and anti-fraud teams are actively targeting these users, as nearly five million Brits have reportedly watched illegal sports broadcasts. Major organisations like the Premier League and Sky are collaborating with authorities to combat this issue. Modified Fire Sticks, often referred to as "fully-loaded," can expose users to risks like data theft and cybercrime, with fines up to £50,000 for both sellers and viewers. The most recent model of the Fire Stick aims to thwart these illegal activities by blocking unauthorised apps and requiring downloads solely from the Amazon Appstore. The crackdown has extended to Ireland, where authorities are also targeting unlawful IPTV operations. Overall, illegal streaming is seen as a significant threat, diverting funds from the entertainment industry and compromising user safety.
