Stockport Council has faced a surge of complaints about missed bin collections since introducing a £59 charge for garden waste in May and changing blue bin paper collections to monthly instead of fortnightly. Reports show an initial peak of around 2,300 missed collections in June, causing confusion among residents and affecting collection efficiency. However, complaints have been declining since then, with the council managing over a million collections monthly. Despite the overall percentage of missed collections being low (0.14%), statistics indicate an increase in failures from 55 to 140 per 100,000 bins. Additionally, the council anticipates a significant recycling rate drop in 2025/26, partly due to a dry summer leading to less garden waste. While many have embraced the new chargeable service, some residents are exploring alternatives, including composting. Council members remain optimistic about improving collection performance as staff become more familiar with their routes.
