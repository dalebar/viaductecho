Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has launched a significant investigation into its officers and staff accused of inappropriate contact with sex workers. This probe began after former Inspector Toby Knight, who held hundreds of meetings with sex workers on duty, was dismissed. So far, three individuals have been sacked, with another 10 under investigation, including a suspended Superintendent. The allegations point to 'non-legitimate' interactions, which are deemed unacceptable under new National Police Chiefs' Council guidance. GMP is prioritising safeguarding vulnerable sex workers while cracking down on misconduct, with the Anti-Corruption Unit actively investigating both the Knight case and wider issues, such as officers skiving while working from home. Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods assures the public that the majority of officers are diligent and that any wrongdoing will be addressed swiftly, as the force aims to uphold integrity and professionalism in their ranks. Additionally, GMP commits to collaborating with partners to ensure the safety and wellbeing of sex workers in the community.
