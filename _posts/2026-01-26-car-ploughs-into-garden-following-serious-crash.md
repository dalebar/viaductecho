A road in Ashton-under-Lyne was closed after a serious crash involving two vehicles on Sunday evening. Emergency services, including police, firefighters, and paramedics, responded around 6.30pm at the junction of Ladbrooke Road and Sycamore Crescent. The collision caused significant damage to both saloon cars, one ending up in the middle of the road and the other crashing into a garden. Pictures from the scene showed a rapid response ambulance, firefighters, and police officers present. Residents reported hearing a police helicopter overhead shortly after the incident. A fire engine from Stalybridge Community Fire Station was dispatched, and firefighters worked with police to secure the area for about an hour. An investigation is currently underway, and Greater Manchester Police has been contacted for further comments.
