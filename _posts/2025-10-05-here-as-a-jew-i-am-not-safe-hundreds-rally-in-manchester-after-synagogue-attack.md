At a rally in Manchester, Sharron Haskel, Israel's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed her fear for safety in the UK after a synagogue attack, visibly wearing a bulletproof vest. The event, organised by the North West Friends of Israel, aimed to honour victims of the October 7 attack and included hundreds of participants, displaying Israeli flags alongside Union Jacks at Manchester Cathedral. Speeches highlighted solidarity within the Jewish community, with Marc Levy from the Jewish Leadership Council emphasising the need for action against antisemitism. Key speakers like Labour MP Christian Wakeford and other advocates called for unity and voiced frustrations over the government's handling of Jewish hate. Levy remarked on the rallyâ€™s importance, noting it as a stand against fear while championing their identity as proud British Jews. The community's recent pain followed a tragic attack that claimed lives and left others injured, underscoring the need for solidarity in the face of escalating tensions.
