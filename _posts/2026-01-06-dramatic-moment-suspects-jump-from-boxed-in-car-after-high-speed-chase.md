Video footage shows a dramatic scene in Bolton where three suspects leapt from a boxed-in car after a high-speed police chase. The pursuit started early on Sunday morning when police spotted a 'suspected stolen' car with false plates. Officers attempted to intercept the vehicle, but the driver fled, leading to a ten-minute chase before police deployed a stinger to halt it. The suspects then jumped out, vaulting over a fence into woodland, but police pursued them, managing to detain two right away. The third suspect initially escaped but was later found by the dog unit. All three men were arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft of a motor vehicle. They’ve since been bailed for a police station visit, although two were also wanted back in prison and have returned there.
