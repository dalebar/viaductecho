The Post Office in Stockport town centre is moving to TG Jones, previously WHSmith, just a short walk from its current location on Great Underbank. The relocation date will be announced soon, and the new office will operate from Monday to Saturday, totalling about 46.5 hours a week. Opening hours are set for 9am to 5.30pm on weekdays and 9am to 1pm on Saturdays. The new Post Office will be on the first floor at TG Jones, featuring two open-plan serving positions and plans for self-service machines later on. A temporary counter will be set up in the meantime. This move is part of a shift towards a fully franchised network, which the Post Office believes will ensure a sustainable future for its services in UK communities, including Stockport.
