LEON restaurant near Manchester Piccadilly has suddenly closed as part of a major restructure after applying for administration. The fast-food chain, founded in 2004, is shutting down unprofitable locations and cutting jobs, blaming the "unsustainable" tax burden and changes brought on by the pandemic. Although the Manchester site had been operating for eight years, it’s now listed as 'permanently closed' on Google, with seven other locations shut in recent weeks. LEON plans to support affected employees with a redundancy programme and a partnership with Pret A Manger for job opportunities. Co-founder John Vincent remarked on the challenges facing the industry, particularly following its acquisition by Asda, which he noted struggled to integrate LEON into its strategy. Administrators from Quantuma are now working on the next steps, aiming to help LEON emerge from administration and return to its core principles.
