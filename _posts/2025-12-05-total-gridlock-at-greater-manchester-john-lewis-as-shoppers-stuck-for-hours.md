Yesterday, visitors at a bustling shopping hub in Greater Manchester found themselves stuck for nearly two hours in gridlock at the John Lewis car park in Cheadle. Eyewitnesses reported being stationary for up to 50 minutes at around 2pm, with one individual stuck for an eye-watering hour and 45 minutes trying to exit. The chaos was attributed to roadworks causing a lane closure, with a warning issued for others to avoid the area during peak shopping times. Local officials confirmed that the work, which included vegetation clearance, would be ongoing from December 3 to 4, worsening traffic at an already busy junction. Frustration was evident, especially as this disruption followed significant delays from previous gas repairs, with one lane on the A34 still coned off. Comments from locals highlighted the frustration of selecting such a hectic time of year for the works, especially with the Christmas rush approaching. John Lewis has been reached for comment.
