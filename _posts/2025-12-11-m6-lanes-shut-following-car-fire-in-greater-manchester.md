There was a car fire on the M6 near Wigan this morning, leading to the closure of two lanes on the northbound carriageway between junctions 26 and 27. This caused delays for drivers heading towards Lancashire. Initially, both lanes were closed, but one lane reopened shortly after, and by midday, all lanes were back open, though slow traffic lingered. Fire services have since cleared the scene, and recovery operations were underway. Drivers are still encouraged to allow extra travel time. Further updates on the situation will be provided as they come in.
