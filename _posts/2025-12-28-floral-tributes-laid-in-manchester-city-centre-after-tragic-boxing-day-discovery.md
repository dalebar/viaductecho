A body was discovered in Manchester city centre by the Bridgewater Hall on Boxing Day morning, leading to a police investigation. The man was pronounced dead on the scene, but authorities confirmed his death is not being treated as suspicious. It’s believed he may have died while sleeping rough, as the area is known for being frequented by homeless individuals. With temperatures dropping to about 4C that night, the situation is a stark reminder of the struggles faced by some during the festive season. Floral tributes have been laid at the spot, where a police tent remained for much of the day. Greater Manchester Police is continuing their enquiries and will release more information as it becomes available.
