A tribute artwork to the late music legend Mani has raised over £11,292 for the Stockport NHS Charity. Artist Mark Reynolds, known as Stuff by Mark, created the piece following Mani's passing, and all proceeds from print sales go to the charity, which supports Stepping Hill Hospital and NHS services in Stockport. Mani and his wife Imelda, who also passed away in 2023, were dedicated supporters of the charity. Mark expressed how much Mani meant to him and the global impact of his loss, while Stockport NHS Charity Manager Kate Leadbeater praised Mark for his talent and generosity. The response to the prints showcases the love people have for Mani and his music.
