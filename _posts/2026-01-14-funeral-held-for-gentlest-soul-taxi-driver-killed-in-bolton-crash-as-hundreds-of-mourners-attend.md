Masrob Ali, a beloved 54-year-old taxi driver from Blackburn, was mourned by hundreds at his funeral following a tragic head-on crash in Bolton that also claimed the lives of three teenagers. Friends and family gathered at the Masjid-e-Sajedeen mosque, where Masrob was remembered as a kind and gentle soul. The service was shifted to a larger venue to accommodate the expected turnout. Masrob's family, who wanted a quick burial in line with their beliefs, faced a delay due to ongoing investigations. His daughter described him as the “gentlest soul” and a devoted father who had emigrated from Bangladesh at 12. Police are investigating the incident and have requested witnesses or anyone with footage to step forward, while urging caution against sharing graphic content related to the tragedy on social media.
