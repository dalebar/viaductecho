Manchester's council leader, Bev Craig, expressed solidarity with the Jewish community following a tragic attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, which left two victims dead and several others seriously injured. The incident occurred on October 2, with police shooting a suspect at the scene. Craig described the attack, happening on a significant holy day, as shocking and called for unity across the city during this dark time. Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell announced increased security measures to protect local Jewish communities, while Crumpsall MP Graham Stringer underscored the importance of community resilience, saying the attack aimed to harm interfaith relationships. Stringer and others emphasized Manchester's commitment to tolerance and support, reminding residents of their capacity to come together, similar to the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack. Greater Manchester Police assured ongoing communication with local synagogues for continued reassurance.
