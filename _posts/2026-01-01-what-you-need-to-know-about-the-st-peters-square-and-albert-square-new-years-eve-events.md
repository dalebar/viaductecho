Manchester is ringing in 2026 with its first-ever official New Year's Eve events in both St Peter's and Albert Squares. At midnight, a dazzling free fireworks display will light up the sky above Central Library, with about 20,000 folks expected at St Peter's Square, the prime spot for viewing. Gates open at 10pm on a first-come, first-served basis, with security checks in place. Only small bags and no glass bottles are allowed, keeping it family-friendly and alcohol-free, with hot drinks and snacks on offer. 

Meanwhile, Albert Square will host around 2,000 people, featuring the UK's biggest mobile ferris wheel and plenty of food stalls, open until close at 12:30am. Attendance will be tightly controlled, so reach here early. Each square won’t allow movement between them once capacity hits, and facilities are available until 1am. So, get ready for a brilliant night in Manchester!
