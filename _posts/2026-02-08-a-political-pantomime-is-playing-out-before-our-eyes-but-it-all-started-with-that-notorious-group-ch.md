A year after the WhatsApp scandal, ‘Trigger Me Timbers,’ unraveled political tensions in Greater Manchester's Labour party, particularly affecting Denton and Reddish. Offensive messages exchanged between local councillors, including Andrew Gwynne, exposed deep divisions within the party, leading to Gwynne's dismissal as a minister and eventual resignation amid local pressure, instigating a by-election. During a recent standards committee meeting at Dukinfield Town Hall, six councillors faced scrutiny for breaching the council code of conduct due to their participation in the controversial chat, filled with inappropriate comments. Brenda Warrington, the only councillor to appear before the panel, apologised for her remarks but maintained that the chat was private and part of a political vendetta against her. Ultimately, the committee found Warrington and the others at fault, imposing formal censure and training. As the political atmosphere grows more fragmented, the upcoming by-election on February 26 has heightened tensions, with the Greens and Reform parties poised to compete against Labour as Keir Starmer’s leadership falters amid ongoing fallout from the scandal.
