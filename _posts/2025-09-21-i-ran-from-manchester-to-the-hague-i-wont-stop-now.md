Raja Aslam, a 37-year-old runner from Blackburn, has completed an impressive 350-mile journey from Manchester to the Hague in just nine days, running around 13 miles a day. He's fundraising for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award charity, which helps young people develop life skills. Raja's trek began at Media City and included an overnight ferry to Rotterdam, with many supporters encouraging him along the way. Despite some challenges, like running alone and dealing with detours, he captured his adventure through TikTok videos featuring his GoPro. His efforts have raised £7,673 so far, exceeding his expectations. Raja, who has been a foster carer for five years, aims to inspire foster children to join the programme. Even after finishing his run, he jumped right back into more running events, including local park runs and upcoming marathons. His dedication is evident, and he's grateful for the backing from his community and the Blackburn Road Runners. If you fancy supporting his cause, you can donate via his fundraising page.
