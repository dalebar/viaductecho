Oldham is still in the lurch over its much-needed new police station, which, bafflingly, won't have any jail cells. Town hall officials and local MPs are in talks with Greater Manchester authorities, trying to find a suitable spot. Currently, officers have to drive out of town to book arrested criminals, wasting over an hour that could be spent on the streets. It's been over five years since the old station on Barn Street was deemed well past its sell-by date. Councillor Sam Al-Hamdani expressed frustration, saying residents are kept uninformed about progress and timelines for the new facility. MP Jim McMahon has been pushing for justice reform in the area since the closure of the Magistrates' Court and other stations, feeling the town has lost its sense of justice. The talks for a new justice centre and proper police facilities are ongoing, and the deputy mayor, Kate Green, is keen on a new station fit for purpose, though no new updates have surfaced recently.
