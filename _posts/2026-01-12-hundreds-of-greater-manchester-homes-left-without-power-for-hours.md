Nearly 800 homes in Levenshulme, south Manchester, were left without power today after an unexpected underground cable incident. The outage began around 2pm and has persisted for several hours. Electricity North West is on-site working to restore power, with an estimated return time before 2am tomorrow (Monday, January 12). They’ve acknowledged the situation was unforeseen but are doing their best to sort it out swiftly and safely. The affected postcodes span a wide range, including M12 and M19 areas. Fingers crossed for a quick resolution!
