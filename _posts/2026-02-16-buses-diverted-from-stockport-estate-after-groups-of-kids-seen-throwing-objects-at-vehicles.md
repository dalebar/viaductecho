Residents in Brinnington, Stockport, have expressed concerns about youth gangs causing disruptions over the weekend, with reports of objects being thrown at the number 325 bus. The incidents led to bus diversions, affecting local transport as passengers were forced to use taxis instead. TfGM stressed the reckless nature of these actions, which jeopardised the safety of drivers and passengers. Local councillor Christine Carrigan described the behaviour as thoughtless, while residents highlighted that the area has a history of anti-social behaviour. Some noted that the kids, lacking activities, might be engaging in such acts out of boredom. However, a long-term resident mentioned that despite the issues, the estate is generally a good place to live. In response to the unrest, Greater Manchester Police are taking action to address anti-social behaviour, having recently conducted operations that resulted in multiple arrests and seizures. The community is encouraged to report incidents to ensure safety and support.
