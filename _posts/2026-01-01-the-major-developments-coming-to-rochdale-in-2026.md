Rochdale is gearing up for a construction boom in 2026 with the mantra ‘Build, baby, build!’ echoing through the town. Housing minister Steve Reed aims to tackle the housing crisis by constructing 1.5 million homes nationally. Over 20,000 locals are waiting for housing, prompting major developments in Rochdale town centre, Castleton, and Littleborough. Projects like the Station Gardens, which is set to create 81 net zero homes, and the Atom Valley scheme, promising 20,000 new jobs and homes, are now underway.

Exciting plans also include constructing hundreds of homes on controversial green belt land in Littleborough and developments in Castleton that will add over 600 new homes. The Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing Centre (SMMC) will kickstart growth in advanced manufacturing and innovation. Meanwhile, Heywood is benefiting from £20 million in funding for revitalisation projects, improving the town centre and creating new opportunities for locals.

Overall, this transformative era for Rochdale promises significant changes, with a focus on housing, jobs, and cultural enhancement as it prepares for its role as Greater Manchester’s Town of Culture in 2025/26.
