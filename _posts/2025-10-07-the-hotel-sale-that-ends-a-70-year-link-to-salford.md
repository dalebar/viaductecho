The Salfordian Hotel, a beloved spot for many locals, is set to be sold and transformed into temporary housing, marking the end of a 70-year connection to Salford. Originally acquired by Salford Council in 1953 to provide affordable holidays for the over-50s, the hotel has been vacant since the Salfordian Trust was liquidated in 2024. Currently, it houses live-in guardians to prevent vandalism. Sefton Council plans to turn the grade-II listed building into emergency accommodation for local vulnerable households. Approval for the sale is expected during a council meeting on October 13. Sefton Council leader Coun Marion Atkinson emphasised the importance of the project in aiding those facing homelessness while addressing community concerns. Salford Council noted that the property's disposal is in line with its strategic goals, as it lies outside the city boundary. The hotelâ€™s transformation aims to provide vital support for residents in need.
