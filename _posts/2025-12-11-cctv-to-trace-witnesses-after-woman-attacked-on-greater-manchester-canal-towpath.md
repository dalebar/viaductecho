CCTV images have been released by Greater Manchester Police in an effort to find potential witnesses following an attack on a woman along the Bridgewater Canal towpath last month. The incident happened around 2.50am on November 30, when a man approached the victim while she was walking home, leading to her shouting out before he fled. It’s believed he then interacted briefly with two men walking in the opposite direction. Police are keen to speak to these men, viewing them as potential witnesses rather than suspects, to aid their investigation. Anyone with information is encouraged to call 101 and reference log 0427-30/11/25.
