Walid Saadaoui, a Tunisia-born former restaurateur, was allegedly caught planning a terror attack on Jewish communities in north Manchester. During the trial, it was revealed he spoke to an undercover operative, Farouk, and expressed a strong desire for vengeance, showing excitement over videos of firearms and ammo for the planned attack. Saadaoui was arrested in May 2024 with two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol, and around 200 rounds of ammunition in his car. Prosecutors claim he wanted to cause maximum harm to Jewish populations in areas like Prestwich and Higher Broughton, discussing potential targets and plans with Farouk. The undercover agent testified they discussed forming a team and even vetting each other for trust issues. Saadaouiâ€™s defence argues he was under pressure and aimed to sabotage the plot by informing the police. Both Saadaoui and co-defendant Amar Hussein plead not guilty to terrorist charges. The trial continues, with tensions high over the serious implications of their alleged actions.
