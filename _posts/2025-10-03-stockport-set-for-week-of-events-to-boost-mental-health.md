Stockport is gearing up for a week of mental health-focused fun with the Stockport Arts and Health Week from 6-12 October, led by Arts for Recovery in the Community (Arc). The event will feature creative workshops, photography walks, and talks on ageing and Alzheimer's, all aimed at enhancing mental wellbeing for individuals, schools, families, and businesses. This initiative is made possible by a Â£32,000 grant from the UK Government. With mental health issues on the rise in Stockport, particularly among young people, these activities offer a much-needed boost. 

Jacqui Wood, the CEO of Arc, emphasised the importance of creativity for mental health and the inclusive nature of this year's events, which also include online activities for a wider reach. One participant, Amir Marvi, shared how photography helped him cope with grief and isolation, highlighting the supportive community that Arc fosters. For a complete list of events, visit www.artsandhealthweek.co.uk and use #ArtsAndHealthWeek2025 on social media. Arc has been a key player in arts and mental health for 30 years, providing vital resources across Greater Manchester.
