Nigel Farage has backed Sir Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, after Ratcliffe faced backlash for claiming the UK has been "colonised by immigrants." This comment, made during a Sky News interview, angered figures like Sir Keir Starmer and Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who described it as "inaccurate and inflammatory." Ratcliffe later apologised for the offensive choice of words but maintained his stance on population growth. Farage supported him in a YouTube video, asserting that Ratcliffe's comments highlighted issues like diminished public services and rising rents, while also making controversial claims about the English proficiency of immigrants. However, fact-checks have since pointed out inaccuracies in Ratcliffe's claims on population growth and migration rates, with the latest census data showing only a small percentage of people in the UK struggle with English. Despite the uproar from various quarters, Farage insists Ratcliffe's views resonate with ongoing concerns about change in parts of UK cities.
