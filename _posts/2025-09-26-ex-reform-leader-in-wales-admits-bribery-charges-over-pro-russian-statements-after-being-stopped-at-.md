Nathan Gill, the ex-leader of Reform UK in Wales, was stopped at Manchester Airport under Counter Terrorism laws and has now pleaded guilty to bribery charges linked to pro-Russia statements he made while serving in the European Parliament. The 52-year-old from Anglesey admitted to accepting money for making statements that benefitted Russia regarding Ukraine from December 2018 to July 2019. He was reportedly instructed by Ukrainian Oleg Voloshyn on multiple occasions. Gill denied one charge of conspiracy to commit bribery, which involved collaborating with Voloshyn and others from January 2018 to February 2020. Prosecutor Mark Heywood KC noted that the guilty pleas reflected the seriousness of the offences. Gill initially entered the European Parliament as a Ukip member in 2014, later serving under the Brexit Party until the UK's exit from the EU in 2020. He led Reform UKâ€™s campaign for the Welsh Parliament in 2021 but is no longer affiliated with the party. He has been granted conditional bail until the sentencing hearing scheduled for November 21 at the Old Bailey.
