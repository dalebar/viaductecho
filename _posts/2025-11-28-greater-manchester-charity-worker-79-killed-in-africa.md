Jeff Cantwell, a 79-year-old charity worker from Oldham, was tragically killed during a mugging in The Gambia. He was ambushed by two men while on his way to dinner with friends on Sunday evening. Despite being found alive, he later died in hospital. His daughter, Janine, expressed shock over his violent death, which occurred shortly after his return to Gambia from a six-month stay in the UK. The family has initiated a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for transporting his body back to the UK, which could cost between £3,000 and £10,000. They’re also dealing with storage fees for his body in the morgue. Janine plans to travel to The Gambia next week to make funeral arrangements. A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed they are supporting the family and working with local authorities. The family is heartbroken and searching for answers about the incident.
