Eighty people have been arrested in Stockport during Operation Rimini, aimed at addressing issues caused by "large gatherings of youths wearing balaclavas." The operation has been ongoing since June 2023, with a focus on high-visibility policing around the newly opened Stockport Interchange. Last year, a 48-hour dispersal order was implemented to combat antisocial behaviour in the area. 

Supt Dave Henthorne highlighted the positive impacts of the operation, noting arrests for retail crime have risen by 49%. Corin Allen, who works at Sterling Foods in the Merseyway Shopping Centre, shared that his workplace has faced thefts, while nearby stores report even worse issues. Despite police visibility, he expressed concern about large groups of youths causing disruptions.

The police are also collaborating with British Transport Police and Trading Standards, which recently confiscated Â£129,000 worth of illegal vapes. The ongoing efforts aim to make Stockport a safer community for residents and workers alike.
