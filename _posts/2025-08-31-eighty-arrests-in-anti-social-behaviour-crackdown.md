Eighty arrests have been made in Stockport as part of Operation Rimini, targeting unruly gatherings of youths in balaclavas causing issues, particularly around the new Stockport Interchange. Since its launch in June 2023, the operation has involved a blend of high-visibility and undercover patrols, leading to 205 charges and seven Criminal Behaviour Orders aimed at habitual shoplifters. Local worker Corin Allen highlighted the frequent thefts at shops, noting that while police are present, they often aren’t visible when trouble arises. Concerns have also been raised about police response times, as the Co-op reported that officers attend only 25% of incidents involving shoplifters. Supt Dave Henthorne mentioned a 49% rise in retail crime arrests, acknowledging the impact on the community. The operation collaborates with British Transport Police and Trading Standards, who recently seized illegal vapes worth £129,000. Despite the challenges, there’s a hope that the increased policing makes Stockport a safer place.
