Eighty arrests have been made in Stockport as part of Operation Rimini, which targets trouble caused by gangs of youths in balaclavas. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have been patrolling since June 2023, focusing on areas around the new Stockport Interchange, which opened in March 2024. There were previous concerns about potential antisocial behaviour in this new space.

Local businesses, like Sterling Foods, report shoplifting incidents are on the rise, with staff feeling increasingly vulnerable. While some have noted the presence of police, others mention they’re often absent when issues arise, particularly with larger groups on bikes. Retail crime has surged by 49%, highlighting the challenge facing shops. 

GMP’s approach includes high-visibility patrols and plain clothes officers, with 205 criminal charges and several Criminal Behaviour Orders issued to combat repeat offences. The operation also collaborates with British Transport Police and Trading Standards, who recently confiscated £129,000 in illegal vapes from local shops.
