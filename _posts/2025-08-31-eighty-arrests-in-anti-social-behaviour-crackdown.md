Eighty people have been arrested in Stockport as part of Operation Rimini, targeting large gatherings of youths in balaclavas causing disturbances around the newly opened Stockport Interchange. The police, including Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and British Transport Police, have boosted their presence since June 2023 with high-visibility and plain-clothed patrols to tackle rising crime and antisocial behaviour in the area. 

Local workers, like Corin Allen from Sterling Foods, report frequent thefts, including from nearby Tesco and Greggs. Despite increased police visibility, there's a sense that they aren't always present during incidents. Arrests for retail crime in Stockport have jumped by 49%, and seven Criminal Behaviour Orders have been issued to tackle prolific shoplifters. 

The operation has also yielded significant seizures of illegal vapes, amounting to Â£129,000. The aim, as highlighted by Supt Henthorne, is to make Stockport a safer place for residents and workers alike.
