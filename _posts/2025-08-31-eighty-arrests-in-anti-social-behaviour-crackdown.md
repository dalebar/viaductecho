Eighty people have been arrested in Stockport as part of Operation Rimini, aimed at addressing trouble from "large gatherings of youths wearing balaclavas." Since June 2023, Greater Manchester Police have increased patrols around the new Stockport Interchange, which opened in March 2024, following issues with anti-social behaviour. Local shop workers have experienced theft, with reports of aggressive shoplifting in stores like Tesco and Greggs. 

Superintendent Dave Henthorne highlighted that high-visibility policing is helping make Stockport safer, while arrests for retail crime have surged by 49%. The operation involves officers from various agencies, including British Transport Police and Trading Standards, who recently seized Â£129,000 worth of illegal vapes from shops. Henthorne mentioned that Criminal Behaviour Orders are being issued to target repeat offenders and curb their access to certain areas. Concerns remain about police response times, particularly when shoplifters are caught, as noted by local businesses.
