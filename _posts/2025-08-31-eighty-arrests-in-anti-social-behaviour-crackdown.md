Eighty people have been arrested in Stockport as part of Operation Rimini, aimed at addressing issues with "large gatherings of youths wearing balaclavas." The police have been patrolling the area since June 2023, after previously implementing a dispersal order to manage disturbances linked to the new Stockport Interchange, opened in March 2024. Superintendent Dave Henthorne emphasised high-visibility policing to enhance safety, reporting a 49% rise in arrests for retail crime. Local workers, like Corin Allen from Sterling Foods, highlighted ongoing theft issues in nearby shops, pointing out that police presence sometimes falls short when larger groups form. The initiative also partners with British Transport Police and Trading Standards, resulting in significant seizures of illegal goods. Overall, residents and businesses are feeling the impact of these efforts in the area.
