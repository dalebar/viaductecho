Eighty people have been nabbed in Stockport as part of a police operation, "Operation Rimini," aimed at curbing trouble caused by youths in balaclavas. Since June 2023, Greater Manchester Police have increased their presence, responding to concerns about gatherings at the recently opened Stockport Interchange. Superintendent Dave Henthorne highlighted that high-visibility policing has made the area safer, despite locals like Corin Allen from Sterling Foods reporting thefts, particularly from nearby stores like Tesco and Greggs.

The operation, which blends uniformed and plain clothes officers, has resulted in 80 arrests and over 200 criminal charges in two years, with specific orders issued to tackle repeat offenders. Concerns over retail crime are rising, with a reported 49% increase in arrests related to it, reflecting a growing unease among shop workers due to a lack of police response during incidents. Officers from British Transport Police and Stockport Council's Trading Standards have also joined efforts, focusing on broader crime issues, including the seizure of Â£129,000 worth of illegal vapes.
