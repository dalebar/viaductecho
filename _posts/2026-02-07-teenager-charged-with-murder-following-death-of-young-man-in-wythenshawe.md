A teenager has been charged with murder after the death of a young man, Drew McCormick, in Wythenshawe. Emergency services were called to Southwick Road late on Thursday night, where they found McCormick, believed to be in his 20s, with stab wounds. Sadly, he died at the scene. Friends remembered him as a "loving, funny, caring young man." Greater Manchester Police announced that 19-year-old Lewis Morley has been charged with murder and was set to appear in court today, February 7, after being remanded in custody.
