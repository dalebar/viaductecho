Public health officials have flagged a suspected avian flu outbreak after several birds died at Sale Water Park in Greater Manchester. Testing is underway to confirm if avian flu is the cause, but officials assure the public that the risk remains 'very low'. They're encouraging visitors to take precautions, like avoiding feeding birds by hand and keeping dogs on a lead away from the water. It's noted that bird flu is common during this time of year as wild birds migrate to the UK from Europe. If anyone finds a dead bird, they should not touch it but report it via the official government site. Additionally, the Martin Mere Wetland Centre in Lancashire has closed temporarily due to a potential bird flu case.
