Thursday's weather in Stockport is a mix of sun and clouds with rain making an appearance. Expect moderate winds and a high of 16°C, dipping to around 10°C later. It’ll feel a bit muggy with humidity at 78% and a rainy 97% chance, so keep that umbrella handy! Winds will be brisk at about 20 mph, possibly making things feel chillier. 

If you're commuting, it’s wise to grab waterproofs and allow extra time as wet roads could slow you down. Layering up is your best bet for the fluctuating temperatures, and if you've got outdoor plans, have indoor backup options in case the rain gets too much. Stay comfy and take it easy out there!
