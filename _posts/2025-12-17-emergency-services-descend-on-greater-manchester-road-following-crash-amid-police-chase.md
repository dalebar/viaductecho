A man in his 30s was taken to hospital after a crash during a police chase in Hattersley, Tameside, on December 17th. The situation started when officers spotted a suspicious vehicle on Mottram Road, leading to a brief pursuit. The chase ended when the driver of a Vauxhall Astra collided with a black Mercedes-Benz SUV and a white pick-up truck on Ashworth Lane. Emergency services, including police, paramedics, and firefighters, responded promptly. The Vauxhall and the pick-up were significantly damaged, but the occupants of the other vehicles reported no injuries. A man was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop and dangerous driving, and an investigation is ongoing. As of now, Ashworth Lane remains closed while authorities assess the situation.
