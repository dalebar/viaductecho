A pub in Rochdale, believed to be the Green Gate, was evacuated after a fire broke out in its roof around 8pm on Tuesday, December 2. Fire crews were quickly on the scene, using ladders, jets, and breathing apparatus to tackle the flames. Donna Cuddihy, who was inside, expressed concern on Facebook for the safety of those affected, highlighting the pub’s significance as someone's home. The fire caused visible flames and smoke, leading to a closure of Halifax Road with a police cordon set up. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they had three engines from nearby areas responding to the incident. Firefighters remained on site to manage the situation.
