Gary Neville's development company, Relentless, is set to redevelop the iconic Kendals department store on Deansgate, giving it a new lease of life after its shopping days are numbered. Originally opened in 1939, the site will be transformed into a mix of offices, cafes, and shops, following a plan approved in 2021. Recent announcements include a £44m investment from Andy Burnham’s new £1bn ‘Good Growth Fund’ to kickstart the project. Relentless will create a modern workspace while preserving the building's historical charm. The plans feature 230,000 sq ft of office space, extensive food and drink areas, and new retail options. A further 280,000 sq ft office will be added where the multi-storey car park used to be. The redevelopment aims to address the high demand for office space in Manchester, making Kendals a crucial player in the city’s growth. This exciting venture follows Relentless's successful completion of No. 1 St Michael’s and expansion plans for the Stock Exchange Hotel.
