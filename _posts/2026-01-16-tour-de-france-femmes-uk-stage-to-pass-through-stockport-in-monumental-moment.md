Stockport is set to shine in 2027 as a key stop in the Tour de France Femmes, happening on 31 July during the event's UK 'grand departure'. The race kicks off in Leeds, moves across to Manchester for stage one, and then continues with stage two through Stockport and the Peak District, finishing in Sheffield before heading to a grand finale in London. Local residents are being invited to volunteer in various roles, making this an exciting opportunity to engage with the event. Cllr Mark Roberts hailed it as a monumental moment for Stockport, highlighting the chance to inspire future generations, particularly women and girls, to embrace cycling and an active lifestyle. British cycling champ Lizzie Deignan MBE shared her excitement, noting the significance of hosting both the men’s and women’s races in the same year.
