Three councillors in Oldham have switched to Reform UK, marking their first seats in the council. Lewis Quigg, a former Conservative from Royton North, along with Independent councillors Mark Wilkinson and Sandra Hall from Failsworth West, now form the party's inaugural official group. Reform UK expressed delight at the trio joining, highlighting their commitment to local residents. Quigg emphasised the need for leadership that prioritises the community, criticising the opposition for allegedly neglecting the needs of ordinary families. He called for a new direction away from Labour's vision and towards Reform's agenda. Wilkinson and Hall echoed these sentiments, asserting that Reform is the way forward to effectively serve their constituents. They claimed that current party politics are failing Failsworth residents and stressed the importance of adapting to the changing political landscape in the UK.
