Snow is on the way for Greater Manchester tonight as chilly Arctic air moves in. Starting around 9pm, areas like Rochdale and Tameside could see snow showers, with the white stuff likely continuing into the early hours of Friday. Higher ground, especially near Rochdale, Yorkshire, and the Pennines, might get the heaviest snow, with forecasts predicting up to 10cm in some spots. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice will kick in at 7pm as temperatures dip to 2°C. The rain will turn to snow in higher areas initially, then spread to lower levels through the evening, with settling snow mainly above 200 metres. On Saturday, expect a more settled day with sunny skies, as high pressure takes charge. But come Sunday, a weather front from the west will bring back rain, strong winds, and snow in northern areas. Stay warm and safe, folks!
