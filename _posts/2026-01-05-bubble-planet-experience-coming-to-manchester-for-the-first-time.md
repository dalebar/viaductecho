Bubble Planet Experience is set to land in Manchester this February at Depot Mayfield, inviting visitors into a whimsical world filled with bubbles. After its success in cities like New York and London, this immersive event promises a dreamy adventure with ten themed rooms, engaging all the senses. Highlights include The Bubble Ocean for a calming vibe, The Infinity Room for an illusion of endless space, and Underwater Bubbles for a deep-sea feel. It's designed for everyone—families, couples, and friends—while kids under two can enter free. There’s even a playful area for younger children and a virtual reality journey for tech enthusiasts. Exhibition Hub CEO Hamza El Azhar expressed excitement about bringing this unique experience to Manchester. Tickets start at £19.90, with more details available online.
