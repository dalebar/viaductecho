Manchester Piccadilly station is undergoing major upgrades in a project costing £7.9 million, leading to a nine-day closure of platforms one to 12. Work started on February 15 and will continue until February 22. The upgrades aim to enhance the reliability of journeys for passengers and freight, with significant infrastructure being replaced for the first time since the 1980s, including 11 sets of points and new cabling. Rail services to the south and east are not running, but some westbound services from platforms 13 and 14 are still operational. Passengers can rely on rail replacement buses and additional services to get around, with accepted tickets on local transport options. Network Rail expressed gratitude for the public's patience during these vital improvements, advising travelers to check updates and allow extra time for journeys.
