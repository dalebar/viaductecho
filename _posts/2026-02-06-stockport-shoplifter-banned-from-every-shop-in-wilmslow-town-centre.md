Ryan Wrigley, a shoplifter from Stockport, has been banned from all shops in Wilmslow town centre after pleading guilty to theft. He received a six-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and a five-year Criminal Behaviour Order preventing him from entering any commercial retailer in the area. Cheshire Police are encouraging locals to report any breaches of this order. Police Constable Madi Forrest expressed hope that this order will give retailers some peace of mind, noting that any reoffending could lead to further fines or imprisonment.
