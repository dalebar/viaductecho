Several roads in Bury, including two in Radcliffe, Whitefield, and Ramsbottom, will be closed for resurfacing work starting October 13. The closures are expected to last for up to 18 months, but the actual work should take around four weeks. Diversions will be set up for affected routes, with specific alternative paths outlined for Ten Acre Drive and Belgrave Street, among others. Bury council highlighted that resurfacing improves the roadâ€™s condition and longevity, with the potential to last up to 20 years. It's a necessary but pricey job that often leads to road closures. Keep an eye on local news for updates!
