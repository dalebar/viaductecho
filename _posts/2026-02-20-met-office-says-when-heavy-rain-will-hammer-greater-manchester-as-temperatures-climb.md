Spring’s nearly here, and the weather’s warming up! After a chilly February, Greater Manchester is set to see temperatures soar to around 11C today, up from just 5C recently. However, expect heavy rain, especially from midday until about 4pm, with some areas like Oldham and Rochdale possibly seeing downpours earlier. Tonight looks cloudy but mostly dry before more rain comes in early tomorrow. Saturday's forecast isn’t much better—light rain off and on, with heavy downpours expected later in the day. But on Sunday, we might get a break with sunny intervals and highs of 12C. Next week should bring milder weather too, with temperatures hitting 12C through Monday and Thursday, and even reaching 14C on Tuesday and Wednesday. Just a heads up—cloudy skies and some light rain are in the cards!
