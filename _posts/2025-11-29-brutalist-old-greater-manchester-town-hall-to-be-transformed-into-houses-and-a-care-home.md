The old brutalist Parkfield House, once Middleton’s town hall, is set to be knocked down and replaced with a care home and new housing. Empty since 2020, the building has faced vandalism and trespassers. Plans include an 80-bed care home and 20 four-bedroom houses, but a local resident raised concerns about the need for another care home, citing seven existing ones nearby. The developer's representative argued that care demand will rise significantly by 2030, stressing the importance of redeveloping the derelict site. The planning committee approved the plans, with some support from local councillors who noted the building had become an eyesore. The new care home will feature a garden and parking, aiming to meet the community's older residents' needs, while the new homes will each come with gardens and parking too.
