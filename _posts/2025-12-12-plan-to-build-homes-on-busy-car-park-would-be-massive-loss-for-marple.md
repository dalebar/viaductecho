Residents in Marple are concerned that knocking down a busy car park at Chadwick Street for new housing could be a significant loss for the town. Stockport council plans to develop at least 174 homes in the area, amid a broader target of 25,000 new homes across the borough by 2042, some of which could impact the green belt. Locals, including traders like John Johnson, Jane Nketiah, and Gemma McBride, argue the car park is essential for visitors and local businesses, particularly during peak times like Christmas. They voice worries over already strained parking and question the rationale behind the car park's removal. On the flip side, a new community hub is being built nearby, promising to bring in more foot traffic. Councillor Steve Gribbon emphasized that the council is listening to residents’ feedback and encourages participation in the ongoing consultation, which runs until December 21, to ensure that concerns are addressed.
