Salford council has admitted that some senior officials haven’t recorded expenses for big-ticket items like taxis and hotels, hiding the numbers from public view. Mayor Paul Dennett’s office spent over £14,000 on purchase cards in two years, yet his declared travel expenses have consistently been £0, apart from a one-time claim in 2017/2018. Critics argue this approach avoids public scrutiny and promotes a lack of transparency. Salford council insists that using purchase cards cuts down on paperwork and helps manage costs but has faced backlash from campaigners and opposition councillors who feel it’s not right to keep these expenditures hidden. Councillor Adam Kealey has expressed disappointment over the lack of transparency and is waiting for receipts detailing these expenses, stressing that taxpayers deserve better. The council maintains it complies with regulations and says it’s considering ways to improve the publication of this spending info moving forward.
