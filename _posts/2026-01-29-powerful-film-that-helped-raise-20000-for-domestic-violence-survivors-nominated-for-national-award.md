A moving film called *Kate’s Story: Transforming the Lives of Children in Refuge*, which highlights the experiences of women and children escaping domestic violence in Greater Manchester, is up for a national award. Produced by local company Films Not Words, the film captures real stories from survivors and raised an impressive £20,000 for new play areas in just a week, as part of Manchester Women’s Aid’s 50th anniversary campaign. It’s entered in the Smiley Charity Film Awards 2026, which celebrate films that foster positive change. Supported by actor Hayley Doherty, the four-minute piece aims to reassure those in similar situations and raise awareness of the charity's essential work. Manchester Women’s Aid’s Project Manager, Ashleigh Saville, and director Helen Tither expressed pride in the film's impact and encouraged people from Manchester to watch and vote for it. Voting closes on January 30, so locals can show their support and help gain national recognition for this important cause.
