A second police cordon has been set up near the tragic synagogue attack in north Manchester on October 2, where two people died and three are seriously injured after a car drove into pedestrians and stabbings occurred outside Heaton Park synagogue on Middleton Road. Armed officers shot the suspect at the scene, who is also believed to have died. The area is under lockdown, with police and an ambulance present, and a helicopter monitoring from above. The attack is being investigated as a suspected terror incident, classified under the PLATO response plan for terrorist attacks. Worshippers were temporarily held inside the synagogue while nearby areas were secured. Greater Manchester Police reassured the community and urged anyone with relevant information or footage to report it directly to them instead of sharing on social media. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer plans to hold an urgent Cobra meeting regarding the incident.
