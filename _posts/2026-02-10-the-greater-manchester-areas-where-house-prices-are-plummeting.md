Seven localities have reported declines of over seven per cent, with Piccadilly (M1) facing the steepest fall, down 19.1% or £60,382, bringing the average down to £255,754. Hulme's prices dropped 16.5% to £262,981, while Ordsall (M5) saw an 11.2% decrease, averaging £189,847. Little Hulton (M38) is now the cheapest area, with a 9.2% drop to £178,959. Higher Broughton and Bolton's BL6 area also experienced declines, down 8.2%. Ancoats has become more affordable, dropping by seven per cent to £263,952. The shifts present some opportunities for buyers looking for cheaper homes in these parts of Greater Manchester.
