Manchester kicked off 2026 in style with a brilliant fireworks display above the Central Library at midnight, delighting around 20,000 locals who gathered in St Peter's Square. Enthusiastic crowds started arriving five hours early, braving the chilly weather with thermals and blankets. The family-friendly event was compered by Joe McGrath from BBC Radio Manchester, featuring tunes from iconic bands like Oasis and The Prodigy. This year was special, as two celebrations took place simultaneously, with an additional 2,000 people enjoying the spectacle in Albert Square. The night was enhanced by an impressive light show, including illuminated Manchester bees on the library and laser beams crossing the crowd, creating a magical atmosphere for all.
