The Social Democratic Party has chosen Sebastian Moore as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton parliamentary by-election. Moore, the SDP's north west chair, returned to Manchester in 2022 after working abroad and aims to focus on local issues like housing, social cohesion, and job creation. He previously ran in the Manchester Central constituency with a modest vote count of 240. Proud of his connection to Manchester, Moore volunteers at a local food bank and is actively promoting the SDP in the region. SDP Leader William Clouston praised Moore for his commitment to addressing the concerns of working-class communities. A full list of candidates is available online.
