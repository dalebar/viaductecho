Salford's mayor, Paul Dennett, is determined to repair a Holocaust memorial bench dedicated to Chaim Ferster, which was vandalised and found destroyed in a frozen lake. Ferster, who survived eight concentration camps and moved to Manchester post-WWII, had the bench installed in Clowes Park after his death in 2017. Dennett expressed his sorrow and support for Ferster's family and the local Jewish community, committing to restore the bench and enhance safety in the park. Greater Manchester Police are investigating the incident, which has sparked outrage, with the Board of Deputies of British Jews condemning it as an act of antisemitic hatred. Ferster dedicated much of his later life to educating others about the Holocaust, emphasising the importance of remembering the past.
