Heavy rain falls on a quiet Wigan street, where a police van stands alone after a chaotic scene earlier. On September 20, police swarmed Bevington Street in Ashton-in-Makerfield following reports of a 'gunman' firing two blank rounds around 11:09 am. A 54-year-old man has been arrested for possession of a firearm, and the weapon has been seized. Locals witnessed the heavy police presence, with one noting they didn't hear the shots despite having their window open. They remarked that such incidents are becoming somewhat typical in the area. After this incident, there was also a firearms report in Gorton, but the two occurrences aren't believed to be related. Greater Manchester Police assured that thereâ€™s no ongoing threat to the public and described the situation as isolated. The arrested man is currently in police custody.
