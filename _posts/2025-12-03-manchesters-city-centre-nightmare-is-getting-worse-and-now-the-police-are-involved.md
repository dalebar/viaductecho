Manchester's roads are getting increasingly jammed as we head into Christmas, hitting record levels of congestion. Last weekend saw about 1.4 million journeys into the city centre over just two days, the highest since records began in early 2020. Frustrated drivers reported severe delays, dubbing parts of the city a "car park," especially around hotspots like Shudehill, Deansgate, and the Arndale. The local police and transport authorities are stepping in with additional patrols to manage the traffic chaos, especially with the bustling Christmas Markets and various events bringing more visitors. Changes in road layouts aimed at improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists have stirred discontent, as motorists face longer journeys. The council has advised everyone to plan their travels wisely and consider public transport during this festive period, as they work to keep the traffic flowing amid all the holiday hustle and bustle.
