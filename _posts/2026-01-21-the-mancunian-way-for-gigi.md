The tragic death of nine-month-old Genevieve ‘Gigi’ Meehan, caused by nursery worker Kate Roughley at Tiny Toes Children’s Day Nursery in Cheadle, has sparked national outrage. Left unsupervised and dangerously positioned on a beanbag, Gigi’s death led Roughley to a 14-year prison sentence. In response, Gigi’s parents, John Meehan and Katie Wheeler, presented a letter to No. 10 advocating for improved nursery safety standards. Their campaign, supported by the Manchester Evening News, calls for mandatory CCTV, regular unannounced Ofsted inspections, and clear safe sleep guidelines for nursery staff. They expressed their frustration over inadequate existing regulations, with John stating the urgency for change to ensure child safety. Additionally, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is launching a 'safety in setting' initiative to enhance early years safeguarding. In other news, Manchester is pushing for growth in specific sectors through the 'Manchesterism' plan, aiming to boost the local economy. Meanwhile, artists from this year’s Manchester Pride are trying to acquire the brand’s assets after the organisation went into liquidation. And on a lighter note, trivia about Morrissey adds some local flavour to the news!
