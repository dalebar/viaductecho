Bus workers in Greater Manchester, including Stagecoach, Metroline, and First Bus, are striking from 19 to 22 September over a pay dispute. Around two-thirds of the region's buses will be off the roads, impacting areas like Stockport. Unite the Union is leading the action, claiming that the companies failed to provide a better pay offer after workers rejected a 3.5% wage increase, which they see as insufficient given inflation is at 4.8%. Another round of strikes is also set for 30 September to 2 October. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, criticised the bus companies for prioritising profit over their staff's needs. Greater Manchester's Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) has urged operators to negotiate with their unions to minimise disruption for passengers.
