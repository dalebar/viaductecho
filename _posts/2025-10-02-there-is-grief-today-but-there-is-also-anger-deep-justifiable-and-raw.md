The horrific attack on the synagogue in Crumpsall has shaken Manchester, targeting the Jewish community on Yom Kippur, a deeply sacred day. Tragically, two lives were lost, and others injured before the alleged assailant was shot by police. This incident highlights the ongoing issue of rising antisemitism in the city, where fear has become a common experience for many Jewish families. Despite the grief and anger felt, the essence of Manchester is to turn this pain into solidarity and action. While questions and investigations will follow, the message is clear: the Manchester Evening News stands with the affected community during this traumatic time. The cityâ€™s commitment to unity and resilience will ensure that such acts of hate only strengthen our bonds. Together, we will not let fear divide us; this is the Manchester way.
