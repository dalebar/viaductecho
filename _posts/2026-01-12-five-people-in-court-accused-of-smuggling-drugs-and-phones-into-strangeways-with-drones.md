Five individuals from Bradford have appeared in Bolton Crown Court, facing charges related to a plot to use drones for smuggling drugs and phones into Strangeways and Maidstone prisons. The group, including Daniel Yasin, 21; Afzal Takolia, 49; Evie Fox, 19; Adam Takolia, 27; and Georgina Marshall, 28, denies conspiring to convey prohibited articles into the prisons between January and November 2022. Yasin has admitted to smuggling phones, while the others refute charges of smuggling phones and transferring criminal property, primarily cash. Adam Takolia has been held in custody, while the rest have been released on bail. The trial, stemming from an investigation by the Regional Organised Crime Unit, is set to commence on May 24, 2026.
