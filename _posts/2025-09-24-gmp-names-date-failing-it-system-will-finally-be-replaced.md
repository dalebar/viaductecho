Greater Manchester Police (GMP) will replace its troubled iOPS computer system in 2027, after the issues began in 2019. Officers were frustrated, claiming the system hindered their ability to perform their jobs safely. A significant failure was identified, with 80,000 crimes unrecorded over a year, leading to the resignation of then-Chief Constable Ian Hopkins. New chief constable Sir Stephen Watson announced plans for a replacement in 2022. Despite a goal for a new system sooner, delays in procurement processes pushed the timeline back. The new Records Management System (RMS), provided by Mark43, is set to launch in spring 2027 after thorough assessments to meet GMP's needs. Deputy Mayor Kate Green acknowledged the lengthy process but stressed the importance of getting it right. The move aims to enhance overall efficacy in GMP operations and restore credibility.
