A tragic crash in Bolton on December 22 resulted in the deaths of two women, aged 57 and 59, after being struck by a VW Polo. The incident occurred around 7.40am at the junction of Scout Road and other surrounding streets. Emergency services were quick to respond, but unfortunately, both pedestrians were pronounced dead at the scene due to severe injuries. A 19-year-old male driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is currently in custody while investigations continue. The area remained cordoned off throughout the day as police gathered evidence. Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information or dashcam footage to come forward. For assistance, individuals can contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit or reach out via their live chat service, quoting log 507 of December 22. Alternatively, anonymous tips can be shared with Crimestoppers.
