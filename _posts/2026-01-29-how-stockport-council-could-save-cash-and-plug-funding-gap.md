Stockport Council is considering job cuts to address a £20m funding gap. With over 800 services to manage, the Lib Dem-led council is under financial strain and is looking at workforce reductions as part of its budget planning. A report highlights plans to save £1.5m through increased productivity in corporate services, integrating functions with partners, and leveraging new tech. While the council aims to mitigate the impact on staff through natural turnover, there are concerns over financial support from the Labour government, particularly as Stockport is expected to miss out on the Recovery Grant again this year. With a looming £75m deficit over the next five years, councillors are actively reviewing every department for potential savings. Deputy leader Councillor Jilly Julian expressed worries that Stockport has been unfairly disadvantaged in the latest financial settlement. Budget proposals are under discussion, set for a vote in February.
