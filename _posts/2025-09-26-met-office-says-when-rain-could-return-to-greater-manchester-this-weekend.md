Greater Manchester’s had a lovely sunny spell since last weekend’s heavy rain, but the weather’s about to shift again. Today (September 26) started off bright, but the Met Office predicts clouds rolling in after lunchtime. Saturday is looking mostly cloudy with a dry start and potential sunny spots in Oldham, Rochdale, and Tameside in the early hours. However, as the afternoon goes on, light rain is expected from around 4pm through the evening. Sunday should be the pick of the weekend, with dry conditions and sunny intervals, plus a cool night ahead. Temperatures will hover around 16-17C, dipping overnight to around 10-11C, and even dropping to 7C in some areas by Monday morning. Keep an eye out for the latest updates on the MAN news website and via their newsletters!
