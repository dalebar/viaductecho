Residents in Urmston, Trafford, faced several hours without running water due to a burst pipe on Flixton Road, which flooded following persistent rain. United Utilities reported the issue late on December 11 and began repairs shortly after, restoring some water pressure by early morning. Though the burst was fixed, locals continued to report problems like low pressure and discoloured water. A temporary road closure was implemented for safety during repairs, but by morning, traffic management had resumed. Residents expressed frustration over recurring issues, recalling a similar flooding incident in September. United Utilities acknowledged the inconvenience and urged anyone still facing problems to contact their 24-hour helpline.
