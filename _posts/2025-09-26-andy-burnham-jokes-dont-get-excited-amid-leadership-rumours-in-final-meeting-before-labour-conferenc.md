Andy Burnham has playfully warned Greater Manchester not to get too carried away amid speculation about him challenging Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership. In recent interviews, he critiqued the government's policies and hinted at a leadership bid, saying Labour needs a solid plan for the country. However, he faced backlash from fellow Labour MPs, questioning whether he’d secure the necessary support to lead. 

At a recent meeting with Greater Manchester’s council leaders, Burnham joked they shouldn't get overly excited about his political future and mentioned he’d keep a low profile at the upcoming Labour Conference, only attending a few events. On a positive note, he expressed support for the government’s commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail, a project he has long championed, which aims to enhance train connectivity in the region, including a crucial stop at Manchester Airport. While there’s been some delay in announcements regarding the project, the government remains dedicated to getting it right.
