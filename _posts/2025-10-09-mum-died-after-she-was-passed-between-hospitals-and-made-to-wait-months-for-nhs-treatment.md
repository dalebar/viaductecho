Honoria Culshaw, a 79-year-old mum from Stockport, sadly passed away after waiting months for treatment for an infection around her pacemaker. She first saw her GP in March 2024 and ended up at Wythenshawe Hospital in July when the infection worsened. Unfortunately, a lack of communication between Wythenshawe and Royal Preston Hospital led to significant delays in her care. Despite undergoing surgery to extract her pacemaker on September 16, 2024, she succumbed to pneumonia on October 25, 2024. The coroner highlighted that a clearer referral process and better communication could have potentially saved her life. The NHS trusts involved expressed their condolences and stated they would review the coronerâ€™s findings to improve patient care and safety moving forward.
