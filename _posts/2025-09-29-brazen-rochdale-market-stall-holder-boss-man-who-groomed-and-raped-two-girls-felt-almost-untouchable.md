Mohammed Zahid, a market stall holder in Rochdale known as 'Bossman', faces justice for grooming and raping two teenage girls in the mid-2000s. He is one of seven men on trial, with Zahid being the only one to abuse both victims, referred to as Girl A and Girl B. Prosecutors described Zahid's confidence, as he brazenly contacted Girl Bâ€™s care home. Despite seeking help from social services, Girl B felt let down, stating they accused her of prostituting herself instead of offering protection.

The abusers, primarily taxi drivers and market traders, exploited the girls, often subjecting them to repeated sexual abuse. Zahid is being sentenced alongside his co-defendants, including Kasir Bashir, who fled the country, and Mushtaq Ahmed, among others, who denied all charges. The trial unfolded with prosecutors outlining the harrowing details of the abuse, highlighting a disturbing pattern of manipulation, grooming, and exploitation over several years. The case has drawn attention to the failures of authorities to protect the victims, leaving them vulnerable to deceitful predators.
