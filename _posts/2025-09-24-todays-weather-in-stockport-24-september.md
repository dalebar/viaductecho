Today in Stockport, expect mild weather with mostly cloudy skies. Temperatures will range from a cool 6°C in the morning to a pleasant 16°C in the afternoon, so a light jacket or sweater is a good shout for early outings. There's only a 10% chance of rain, making it a mostly dry day for any outdoor plans. Humidity will be around 76%, which could feel a bit sticky at times.

A gentle breeze at 12 mph will keep things comfortable, so cycling or walking should be quite pleasant. Commuters shouldn't face any weather-related hiccups, but it's wise to start with a lightweight coat. Enjoy the day outdoors if you can, whether it's a stroll in the park or a meet-up. Just a heads-up: carrying an umbrella might be a smart move, and don't forget to keep hydrated!
