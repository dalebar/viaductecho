Heaton Park's Lakeside Cafe has had a fab makeover just in time for February half term. The new retro lake house style celebrates the park’s lovely Boating Lake and features comfy seating, atmospheric lighting, and a mural by local artist Myro Doodles. Outside, you’ll find reclaimed vintage boating oars and extra seating to soak up the scenery. Co-founder Amy Campbell expressed delight over the refurb, appreciating the team effort that brought it to life. Customers on social media are loving the new look and the dog-friendly space.

The café offers a varied menu with stacked sandwiches, breakfasts, burgers, and fancy drinks like luxury hot chocolates and milkshakes. For February half term, there are also exciting events, including a Zodiac Quest, free crafts, and performances to celebrate Lunar New Year. Plus, the fun fair is back with loads of rides, and you can enjoy boating activities too. The cafe’s new hours are 9am to 5pm daily and 8am on Saturdays for Park Run.
