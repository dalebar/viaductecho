Two men, aged 24 and 28, arrested after a shooting outside a house in Salford have been released on bail, according to Greater Manchester Police. The incident occurred on Wally Square in Higher Broughton around 6:50pm on December 4. A gunman, who arrived on an electric bike with another man, fired shots near a property, resulting in a minor injury to a woman in her 20s. The police are still investigating how she was hurt. GMP's Major Incident Team is urging witnesses or anyone with relevant footage to come forward, stressing that gun violence will not be tolerated in the area. Detective Inspector Louise Edwards highlighted the seriousness of the situation and reassured the community that they are working hard to ensure justice is served. Anyone with information can contact GMP or Crimestoppers anonymously.
