Commuters in Manchester are having a tough morning with delays across multiple motorways. The M6 southbound is particularly affected due to a crash near the Thelwall Viaduct, causing queues back to junction 23. The M60 is partially blocked at junction 27 for Portwood, leading to backup past Denton Island. Additionally, there are slow-moving queues on the M62 eastbound between Birchwood and the M60 Eccles Interchange due to an obstruction. The M56 eastbound is also causing headaches with a breakdown closing a lane between Bowdon and Hale, impacting those heading to the airport and city centre. Stay tuned for live updates on the situation.
