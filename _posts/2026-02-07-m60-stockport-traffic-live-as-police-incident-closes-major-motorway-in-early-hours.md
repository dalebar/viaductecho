The M60 motorway in Greater Manchester faced an early morning closure due to a police incident, affecting traffic between J1 Pyramid Roundabout and J25 Bredbury Interchange. Emergency services, including Greater Manchester Police, were on the scene, and diversions were implemented. Initially, delays were estimated at around 30 minutes, with normal traffic not expected until 5:30 am. However, the situation has now been resolved, and the motorway has reopened, with conditions easing. Diversion routes were clearly marked for drivers, guiding them through alternative roads.
