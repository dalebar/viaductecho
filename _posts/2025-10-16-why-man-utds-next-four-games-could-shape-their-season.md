Ruben Amorim's got a reason to feel hopeful as Manchester United gears up for their next Premier League match. Surprisingly, the toughest opponent in their coming fixtures is actually the one they've managed to snag points from in the past two years. Back in January, they pulled off a draw at Anfield thanks to Lisandro Martinez and Amad Diallo, though Harry Maguire missed a golden opportunity for a win. The aftermath of that match was a bit rocky, especially with Amorim's fiery comments.

Things got worse when United fell to Nottingham Forest again in the league, with Anthony Elanga scoring the winner—ouch. Meanwhile, their worst defeat under Amorim was in the Europa League final against Spurs, which cost them a Champions League spot this season. So, there’s definitely a lot to prove on the pitch!
