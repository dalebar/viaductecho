Manchester has 170,000 cars sharing the road with 551,000 residents, and many of these will soon be electric vehicles (EVs). Last year, 20% of new cars sold were all-electric, signalling a shift towards cleaner streets and air. However, EVs come with challenges, like being heavier than petrol or diesel cars, posing risks to pedestrians. A major concern is the lack of charging options since many Mancunians donâ€™t have off-street parking. While some cities have installed chargers in lamp-posts, Manchester struggles, with only 3% of its lamp-posts being suitable. Residents often resort to draping cables over pavements, which raises safety worries. Locals like Lauren and Sarah share their experiences, highlighting the daunting costs and logistics of home charging. Despite enjoying the benefits of electric cars, some still find commuting and charging a hassle, especially with full service station chargers and the added time for recharging. Councillors express concern over how to facilitate EV charging citywide, stressing the importance of safe pavements and access to charging solutions for residents.
