Harry Gregg’s iconic Manchester United goalkeeper shirt from the 1958 FA Cup final is up for auction next month. This match, held just months after the tragic Munich Air Disaster, is significant in football history. Gregg, hailed as the 'Hero of Munich' for rescuing teammates from the wreckage of the crash, wore this shirt during a controversial game against Bolton Wanderers, which ended in a 2-0 defeat. The shirt could fetch around £20,000, but it's expected to go for much more given its historical weight. The auction also includes other notable items from his career, like match-worn shirts from European fixtures, showcasing his impact on the sport. Gregg, who passed away in 2020, made 247 appearances for United and represented Northern Ireland in the 1958 World Cup. He also founded the Harry Gregg Foundation to inspire young people through sport and education. This collection isn't just about football; it tells a story of resilience, courage, and enduring legacy, making it a coveted piece for collectors.
