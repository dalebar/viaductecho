A family is expressing heartfelt gratitude to North Manchester General Hospital for fulfilling their beloved mum Laura Hyndman's final wish. Laura, who passed away on November 28 after a battle with cancer, married her partner Sam just two days before her death in the hospital chapel. Her daughter Olivia and sister Carla highlighted how the hospital staff went out of their way to make the wedding happen, coordinating everything from the ceremony to home transport in a decorated ambulance. With help from the matron and nurses, they organised a lovely wedding with family, flowers, and matching outfits for Laura and her daughter. Despite her illness, Laura was aware of the day and smiled throughout. The family praised everyone involved, from hospital staff to friends who gathered quickly to support. The ceremony, attended by around 65 people, was a heartwarming celebration amidst the sorrow, proving that love and community can shine through even the toughest times.
