A tram crash in Didsbury Village, south Manchester, injured a woman and a teenage boy on December 17. Emergency services arrived around 7:40 PM after the two pedestrians were struck by a Metrolink tram. The boy sustained minor injuries, while the woman was taken to hospital with back injuries. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) confirmed they were supporting emergency services, and the tram line between St Werburgh's Road and East Didsbury was temporarily suspended. Trams were redirected to Sale Water Park, and ticket acceptance was arranged for local buses. Photos from the scene showed emergency personnel evacuating tram passengers and assisting the injured. Greater Manchester Police and the Fire and Rescue Service were also on site, responding to the incident.
