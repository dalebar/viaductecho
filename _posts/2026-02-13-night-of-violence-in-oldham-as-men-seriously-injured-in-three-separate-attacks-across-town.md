Three men were seriously injured in Oldham during a series of attacks tonight, prompting police to enforce a 24-hour section 60 order for extra stop and search powers in the area. The assaults included two stabbings and another incident resulting in potentially life-changing injuries. The first attack occurred in Butler Green around 5:50 PM, where a 26-year-old is now in hospital. Just before 7:30 PM, a 21-year-old man was stabbed in a car park on Chadderton Way but his injuries are not thought to be life-changing. Police have arrested another 21-year-old in relation to this incident. Shortly after, a third man was stabbed on Featherstall Road North and is currently in stable condition. Investigators, including Det Sgt Jennifer O’Brien, are looking into the circumstances and believe the incidents might be targeted, though it’s unclear if they’re linked. They’re reassuring the community and asking for any information to help resolve the situation. The police are proactively tackling knife crime as a wider initiative within Greater Manchester.
