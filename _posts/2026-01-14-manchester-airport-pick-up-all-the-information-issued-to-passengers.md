If you're flying to or from Manchester Airport, pick-up details vary by terminal. Starting November 19, 2025, all airlines from Terminal 1 will shift to Terminals 2 and 3 due to a £1.3bn redevelopment. Express pick-up has also been moved—just follow the signs on Terminal Road North to find it. For Terminal 2, head to the P3 zone for pick-up (Postcode: M90 5PR). You'll pay £6.40 for up to 15 minutes, with a £100 fine for using the drop-off zone. Ground floor is strictly turn-up; pre-booking is only for first or second floors. Terminal 3 pick-up (Postcode: M90 1NN) costs £6.40 for 15 minutes or £8.30 for 30 minutes, with payments at the exit. Same £100 fine for drop-off zone use applies. For longer waits, check out short stay or turn-up parking options.
