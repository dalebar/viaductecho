A man was stabbed in Salford Quays amid rising tensions related to the ongoing conflict in Syria. This incident followed two nights of unrest on Manchester's Curry Mile, linked to protests over the situation in the Middle East. Last night, about 300 people took part in a peaceful protest at Exchange Quay, but later a 23-year-old man was stabbed; thankfully, his injuries are not life-threatening. No arrests have been made, and investigations are still underway. The flare-ups are tied to escalating clashes between Syrian government troops and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Recently, a ceasefire was announced, but prior breakdowns in negotiations have led to continued violence. This unrest also coincided with reports of escaped detainees from a camp for families linked to ISIS. Overall, tensions remain high, and the situation in Syria continues to impact local events here in Manchester.
