A rescue cat named Marley, 12, has been discovered with pellet bullets lodged in his neck after reportedly being shot eight times in Salford. He was taken in by Carrington Animal Rescue, where vets found lumps on his head during a check-up for skin issues and vomiting. The discovery of the pellets led to heartbreak among the rescue team, who shared their distress on social media about Marley's ordeal and questioned how anyone could harm such a vulnerable creature. Despite his trauma, Marley remains affectionate and continues to trust humans. The rescue centre is working hard to ensure his comfort and well-being, providing medical care and lots of cuddles while seeking support from the community. Thankfully, his blood tests returned clear, and they plan to keep everyone updated on his progress, encouraging kindness towards him.
