Today, Greater Manchester is set for a brighter, sunnier day after a weekend of heavy rain that led to a yellow rain warning and multiple flood alerts. Rain fell from Sunday through Monday, affecting areas like the Lower River Irwell and Middle River Mersey. This morning, alerts remain for parts of Trafford and Hale, but conditions are expected to improve with a mix of sunshine and clouds, reaching highs of around 8°C. However, don’t get too comfy as more heavy rain is on the way for Wednesday, potentially bringing coastal gales and local flooding. Meanwhile, flights at Manchester Airport faced delays due to the earlier weather, with one runway temporarily closed for repairs.
