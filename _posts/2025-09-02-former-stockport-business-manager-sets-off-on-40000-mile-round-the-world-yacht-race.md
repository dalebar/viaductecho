Jo Worrall, a retired school business manager from Stockport, is gearing up for an epic adventure by taking part in the Clipper Race 2025, sailing 40,000 miles around the globe. This annual race is designed for those with little sailing experience, featuring training for participants from diverse backgrounds. Jo, now part of the Yacht Club Punta del Este team, decided to embark on this journey after her divorce, seeking something different and exciting after years of hard work. The race will see her and her fellow sailors battle extreme weather conditions across six oceans, living in close quarters on a yacht for about 11 months. Their route includes stops at various ports such as Cape Town, Fremantle, and Qingdao, before returning to Portsmouth next summer. Jo's story reflects the Clipper Race's mission to make sailing accessible to everyone, no matter their background. Sheâ€™s keen to embrace this challenge, ready to rediscover herself on the open sea.
