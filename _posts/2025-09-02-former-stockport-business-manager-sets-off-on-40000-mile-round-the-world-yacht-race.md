Jo Worrall, a retired school business manager from Stockport, is gearing up for an incredible adventure by sailing 40,000 miles around the world as part of the 2025 Clipper Race. This annual event welcomes participants with little sailing experience, providing training before they embark on a journey designed to test human resolve. Jo, part of the Yacht Club Punta del Este team, felt inspired to take on this challenge after a divorce, wanting to pursue something just for herself. 

The race, which kicked off from Portsmouth on August 31, 2025, will last around 11 months, with Jo and her team navigating six oceans and encountering extreme weather conditions. With stops planned in places like South Africa, Australia, and even the USA, Jo looks forward to this transformative experience. The Clipper Race, founded by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, promotes inclusivity in sailing and aims to break down barriers for participants from diverse backgrounds.
