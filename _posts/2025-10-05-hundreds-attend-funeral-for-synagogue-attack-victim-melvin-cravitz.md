Hundreds gathered to honour Melvin Cravitz, a 66-year-old victim of the tragic synagogue attack in Manchester. The dad-of-three was killed alongside another man in front of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation during Yom Kippur services on October 2. His funeral on October 5 saw an emotional turnout at Crumpsall, led by Rabbi Daniel Walker. Friends and family remembered Melvin as a kind, charismatic man who devoted his life to supporting his community and family. A tribute from his family highlighted his caring nature and love for life. His long-term employer, David Salzman, described him as someone with a "big heart" who always lent a hand to others. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police have detained four suspects connected to the attack, with a court warrant allowing for extended custody. Two others who were arrested were released without charge. The community mourns deeply, seeking privacy as they navigate this shocking loss.
