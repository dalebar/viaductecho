A tragic crash in Bolton claimed the life of 54-year-old Uber driver Mosrab Ali from Blackburn, who was described by family as "the gentlest soul." Mosrab was on his way to work when his taxi was struck head-on by a red Seat Leon, resulting in his immediate death. Three teenagers in the Seat also lost their lives, while two passengers in Mosrab's taxi suffered life-threatening injuries. Despite his family's concerns about him driving late at night, Mosrab reassured them not to worry. His daughter, Humayra, praised him as a kind and safe driver. The family received support from friends and relatives during this devastating time. The police have been helpful and are investigating the incident, having obtained CCTV footage that suggests Mosrab wasn't at fault. They are urging witnesses to come forward.
