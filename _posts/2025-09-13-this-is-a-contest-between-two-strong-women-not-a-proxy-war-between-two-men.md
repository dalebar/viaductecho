Lucy Powell got a call just after Angela Rayner resigned, informing her she was no longer Leader of the House of Commons. While she wasn't shocked, she felt her lack of engagement in political games might have contributed. Shortly after, she found herself as a finalist in the race to replace Rayner. Encouraged by colleagues, she decided to run amidst a busy schedule, balancing her parliamentary duties with personal commitments like parents' evening.

She’s not keen on seeing the contest as a proxy battle between men and emphasizes the importance of strong female representation. Powell has voiced concerns about Labour's direction, especially on issues like welfare reform and acknowledges the need for a more consultative government approach. Representing Manchester Central, she understands her diverse constituency's needs and insists on the importance of a narrative that resonates with working-class voters. Despite challenges, she believes the government has made significant achievements but admits there’s still work to do to regain trust. Powell's readiness to take on this challenge signals her commitment to serve and address the real issues facing ordinary people.
