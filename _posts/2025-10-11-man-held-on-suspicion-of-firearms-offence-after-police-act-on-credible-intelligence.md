A man in his 30s has been arrested in Salford on suspicion of possessing a firearm after police acted on credible intelligence. The arrest took place at a property on Thorpe Street as part of a proactive operation, separate from a recent terrorist incident at a nearby synagogue. Greater Manchester Police confirmed that the investigation is ongoing, with a scene secured for further inquiries. Detective Inspector Michael Jimenez assured the public that there is no wider threat and emphasised their commitment to tackling gun crime and ensuring community safety. Extra patrols are now in place in the area, and officers are available to address any concerns from residents.
