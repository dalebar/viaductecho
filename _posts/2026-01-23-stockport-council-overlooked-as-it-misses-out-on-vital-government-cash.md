Stockport and Trafford councils have once again missed out on crucial government funding, specifically the Recovery Grant, aimed at areas with greater need. This is particularly concerning for Stockport, which houses the most deprived part of Greater Manchester at Lancashire Hill. Despite previous funding issues, the council's deputy leader, Cllr Jilly Julian, expressed frustration, highlighting a funding shortfall of £63 million by the fiscal year 2029/30, exacerbated by an additional £12 million gap from the latest settlement. 

Local MP Lisa Smart noted that Stockport missed out on the Recovery Grant by a mere 0.01%. Trafford’s council leader, Cllr Tom Ross, echoed the disappointment, pointing out that Trafford was one of only three metropolitan boroughs not eligible for support. In a bid to tackle its financial challenges, Trafford is seeking a £20 million loan from the government. While the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government acknowledged the councils' situations and promised increased funding, the ongoing concerns about local services remain.
