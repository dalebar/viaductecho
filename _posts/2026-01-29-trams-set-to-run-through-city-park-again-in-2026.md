The Heaton Park tramway in Manchester, which has been dormant for a year, is set for a revival thanks to a £481,000 funding boost from the council. This restoration will see the trams operational again by spring 2026, just in time for their 125th anniversary. Councillor Lee-Ann Igbon expressed joy over the return of the vintage trams, which many hold dear. The upgrades will ensure the trams run safely for years to come. The Manchester Transport Museum Society volunteers, who have been involved since 1979, welcomed the funding as a sign of confidence in their long-standing efforts.
