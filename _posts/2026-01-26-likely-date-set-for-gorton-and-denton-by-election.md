The by-election for Gorton and Denton, set to replace former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, is likely happening on February 26. This comes after MPs officially triggered the process on Monday. Labour's chief whip, Jonathan Reynolds, moved for the writ to be issued, stating it's needed for electing a new member for the constituency. The Commons Speaker confirmed this motion, and MPs agreed quickly. Gwynne, who stepped down due to significant ill health, was also suspended from the Labour Party last year over comments in a controversial WhatsApp group. Interestingly, Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester's mayor, has been blocked from standing in the by-election after seeking permission. As of now, no candidates from any party have been announced.
