A man is being held under the Mental Health Act after attacking three people in the A&E of Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester on January 2. Witnesses described chaotic scenes as he punched an elderly man and bit off part of another man's ear after he tried to intervene. A bystander, Michael Anderson, and a nurse managed to restrain the attacker until security arrived. The police confirmed that a 22-year-old man, suspected of assault and racially aggravated public order offences, remains in custody. Two victims received minor injuries, while a man in his 30s suffered serious ear injuries. Greater Manchester Police is actively investigating the incident, acknowledging the fears it has raised in the community. This attack follows another incident at Newton Community Hospital a few days earlier, where six individuals were injured. The suspect in that case, a 20-year-old man, was also detained under the Mental Health Act.
