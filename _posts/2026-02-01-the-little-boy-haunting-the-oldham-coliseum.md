A photo from inside the Oldham Coliseum, currently undergoing a £10m renovation, has sparked chatter about its haunted history. Captured by a scaffolding contractor, it seemingly shows a ghostly boy in Victorian clothing, reigniting local ghost stories that include weird noises and sightings from former staff. Actor Julie Hesmondhalgh, a campaigner for the theatre's future, insists the image isn’t doctored. The Coliseum, which has a history of spooky encounters, was even featured on the show ‘Most Haunted’. Employed staff have reported odd events like doors opening by themselves and a ghost named Harold Norman, an actor who died tragically on stage. While many dismiss these tales as urban legends, the Coliseum’s long past—built on an old coal pit—adds to its eerie atmosphere. As the theatre prepares to reopen, the ghostly presence lingers in the minds of those who have worked there, pondering how the "little ghosties" are faring during its quiet moments.
