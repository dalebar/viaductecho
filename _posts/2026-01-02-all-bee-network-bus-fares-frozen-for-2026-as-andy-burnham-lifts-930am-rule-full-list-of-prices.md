Andy Burnham has announced that all Bee Network bus fares will be frozen for 2026 to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. The £2 fare cap, which allows unlimited bus journeys within an hour, will remain in place for the fourth year running, with child fares costing £1. Burnham highlighted the importance of this fare cap, noting how much it means to the community. Metrolink tram fares will also stay the same for now, but some price increases could happen later next year. 

In a significant change for disabled and older passengers, they will benefit from unlimited free bus travel starting March, removing the previous restriction of having to pay before 9:30am. This decision follows successful trials and is expected to affect around 400,000 passengers. Campaigners voiced their support, stating this change will enhance freedom and reduce stress, allowing them to engage more actively in their communities. Overall, it's a positive step toward making public transport more accessible amidst rising living costs.
