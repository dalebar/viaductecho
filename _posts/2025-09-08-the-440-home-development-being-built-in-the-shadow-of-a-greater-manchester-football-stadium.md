Developers and investors are buzzing after Lumina Village, a 440-home build-to-rent project near Old Trafford, hit its highest point with a topping out ceremony. Key players from Glenbrook, Moorfield Group, and Trafford council were there to mark the milestone. This £250m mixed-use development, replacing the old Kellogg’s HQ, will provide one to three-bedroom apartments and townhouses for private rent, mainly targeting young families and professionals. It's part of Trafford's broader plan to add 4,000 new homes and improve local infrastructure. Council leader Cllr Tom Ross hailed it as a vital project for the area. The first homes are set for completion by summer 2026, with the entire development wrapping up later that year. Exciting times ahead for Manchester’s housing scene!
