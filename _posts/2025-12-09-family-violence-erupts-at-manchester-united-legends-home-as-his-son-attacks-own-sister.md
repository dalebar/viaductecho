Patrick Crerand Junior, son of Manchester United’s Paddy Crerand, avoided jail after a violent incident left his sister Lorraine with a broken shoulder. The altercation erupted after they argued following a football match they were watching together. Lorraine, 58, fled the family home unaware of her injuries but later sought medical help for severe pain, discovering she had fractured her clavicle. Patrick, 61, initially denied wrongdoing, blaming Lorraine’s intoxication instead.

At Bolton Crown Court, he pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and received a suspended nine-month sentence, along with a 12-month restraining order preventing contact with Lorraine. The judge highlighted the ongoing impact of the injury on Lorraine’s daily life and the complex family dynamics involved. Patrick has prior offences and expressed remorse for his actions. Additionally, he was placed on a curfew and ordered to undergo rehabilitation. The case underscores the serious consequences of violence within family settings and the importance of addressing underlying issues.
