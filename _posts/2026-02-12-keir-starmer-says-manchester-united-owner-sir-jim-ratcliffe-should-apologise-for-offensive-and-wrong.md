The Prime Minister has called out Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the Manchester United co-owner, for his "offensive and wrong" comments about immigration, where he claimed that the UK has been "colonised by immigrants." During an interview, Ratcliffe suggested that the UK needs to make tough decisions to recover economically, pointing to a problematic situation with many people on benefits and high immigration levels. In response, Sir Keir Starmer also demanded an apology, emphasising Britain's pride in its diversity. Ratcliffe was critical of Starmer, suggesting he needed to be tougher and noted that while he respects Nigel Farage, he also saw potential in Starmer. Since becoming part of Manchester United's ownership in late 2023, Ratcliffe has faced backlash from fans, particularly regarding ticket pricing, leading to protests against the club's owners, including himself and the Glazers.
