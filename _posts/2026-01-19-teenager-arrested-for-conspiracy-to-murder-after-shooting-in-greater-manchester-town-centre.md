A teenager, 18, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder following a shooting in Urmston's Trafford town centre. The incident occurred on January 16, around 8.40pm, where a 21-year-old man was shot and is currently in a stable but critical condition in hospital. The police described the shooting as a targeted attack but reassured the public there's no wider threat. Following the incident, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) executed five raids leading to the arrest. Officers and paramedics responded quickly, and armed police were present at the scene. DCI Justin Bryant emphasised GMP's commitment to tackling gun crime, which has reportedly decreased by 52% over the past four years, and has urged anyone with information or footage related to the incident to come forward. The local community is being supported with increased patrols for reassurance.
