Bee Network bus drivers in Greater Manchester are set to strike for four days from September 19 to 22 over pay disputes with Stagecoach, Metroline Manchester, and First Bus Rochdale. Over 2,000 drivers are represented by Unite the Union, which argues that recent pay offers—3.5% from Stagecoach and Metroline, and 6% from First Bus—are inadequate amid rising living costs and inflation. The strikes are expected to severely disrupt services, particularly during major events like a Manchester United match and concerts. Both Unite and the bus companies are calling for negotiations, with employers expressing disappointment over the planned strikes. They assert their offers are above inflation and aimed at supporting drivers through tough economic times. The situation remains fluid, with transport authorities monitoring developments closely.
