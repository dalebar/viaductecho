Trams between Rochdale and Oldham are set to return tomorrow after a two-day disruption caused by a collision at the Oldham Way and Manchester Street roundabout, damaging tram signalling. Repairs are happening tonight, and while trams are down, diversions for motorists are in place. Commuters should check their routes as services should resume by tomorrow morning, though road diversions will be active from 7pm tonight. In the meantime, Metrolink tickets are valid on Bee Network buses and train services between Rochdale and Manchester. Passengers can find journey planning assistance on the Bee Network website and app.
