Detectives have pulled off a massive drugs bust in Blackrod, Bolton, seizing around £24 million worth of cannabis. During a raid on January 9 at Leigh Tenement Farm, they found two tonnes of the class B drug. Two men, aged 27 and 35, have been arrested and are being questioned. Greater Manchester Police described the operation as one of the largest single seizures in the UK. Detective Superintendent Joe Harrop noted that this bust not only disrupts significant criminal networks but also helps protect vulnerable individuals. The police are committed to tackling large-scale drug production and making local communities safer, sending a clear message that such activities won’t be tolerated.
