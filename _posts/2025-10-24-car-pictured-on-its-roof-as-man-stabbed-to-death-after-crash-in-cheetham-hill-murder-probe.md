A murder investigation is underway following a stabbing incident in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, where a 26-year-old man died after sustaining serious injuries. Emergency services were called to Cardinal Street on Thursday afternoon, and despite attempts to save him in hospital, he sadly passed away. A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is being questioned by police. Witnesses describe a car chase that ended in a crash before the stabbing occurred, which is believed to be a targeted attack. Police have cordoned off the area for evidence collection, with an image of a hatchback on its roof emerging from the scene. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) stated that they are prioritising the investigation and will increase their presence in the community as they seek more information. Anyone with details, including CCTV or dashcam footage, is encouraged to reach out to the police or Crimestoppers.
