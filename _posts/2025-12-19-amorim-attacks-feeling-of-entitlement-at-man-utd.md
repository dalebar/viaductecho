Ruben Amorim, Manchester United's head coach, has expressed concerns about a "feeling of entitlement" at the club, urging players to transform criticism into motivation. He believes some players need to reconnect with what it truly means to wear the United shirt. Ahead of the upcoming match against Aston Villa, Amorim reflected on both young players and broader challenges within the squad. Meanwhile, Sir Alex Ferguson, during a recent trip to Bahrain, warned that it might take another 10 to 11 years for United to reclaim a Premier League title, which they haven't won since Ferguson's last victory in 2013.
