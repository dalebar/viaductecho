Salford is set for major transformation with plans for around 67,000 new homes over the next 20 years, particularly in areas like Salford Quays and the city centre. The Salford Growth and Regeneration Partnership aims to accommodate the growing population and ongoing redevelopment, including significant projects like the £2.5bn Salford Crescent scheme. The initiative will see collaboration between the council and private developers to meet housing demands while also creating commercial opportunities.

Key locations such as RHS Bridgewater, Swinton, and Eccles are part of the investment focus, with developments underway, like the demolition at Eccles shopping centre. Plans also include new high-rise housing, with proposals for some of the tallest towers in the UK. However, the city is facing challenges with rising homelessness, and the council is keen to attract more investment to support its growth strategy.

Salford’s aim is to boost housing quality and delivery, ensuring it remains an attractive destination for future development, reflecting the city’s commitment to the community and social economy.
