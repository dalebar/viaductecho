A shooting in Manchester's Gay Village is not being treated as a hate crime, according to police. Armed officers arrived at Richmond Street around 5am after reports of a disturbance and found a man in his 20s with a gunshot wound to his leg. He is now in a stable condition in hospital, and his injuries are not life-threatening. Six men, aged 23 to 26, have been arrested on suspicion of affray and firearms offences, and they remain in custody as investigations continue. Police say the incident appears to be targeted, and there's no wider threat to the community. Superintendent Stephen Wiggins assured the public that officers will be visibly present in the area for reassurance. Carl Austin-Behan from the Village Business Association emphasised that this was not an attack on the LGBTQ+ community. Anyone with information is encouraged to reach out to Greater Manchester Police.
