Asda has become the first major supermarket to lower prices on essential items despite recent hikes from competitors. Mince prices at other stores like Sainsbury's and Tesco rose to around £3.50 for 500g, while Aldi now sells it for £3.09. Asda, however, has reduced its mince price to £2.99, which makes it second cheapest after Lidl. In a recent price comparison, Asda's overall basket of eight items costs £13.09, just slightly above Lidl’s £13.04. Aldi now sits in third place, with prices for the same basket at £13.23. While Asda, Lidl, and Morrisons are selling mince for £2.99, it’s a sharp climb from £1.69 at Aldi back in March 2022. The price comparisons are contested by the supermarkets involved, with Aldi and Asda arguing that quality differences and broader product ranges aren’t properly represented. Sainsbury's also mentioned that industry factors have influenced beef pricing. Meanwhile, Lidl has maintained its position as the cheapest supermarket for the fifth week running.
