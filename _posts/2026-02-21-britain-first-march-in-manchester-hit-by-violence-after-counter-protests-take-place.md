Hundreds gathered in Manchester for a Britain First protest, promoting 'remigration and mass deportations', beginning at Piccadilly station. Counter-protests, including one featuring former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, also took place in support of anti-racism. The police delayed the Britain First march for an hour, resulting in clashes and multiple arrests in Piccadilly Gardens. A 10-hour dispersal order was issued by Greater Manchester Police to maintain order amidst concerns of anti-social behaviour.

Police reported six arrests related to public order offences and other incidents, as they deployed extra resources including mounted units. During the rally at Castlefield Bowl, speeches continued despite disruptions. The protests impacted local bus services, causing significant delays.

Manchester council leader Bev Craig emphasised that Britain First was unwelcome in the city, urging unity against hate. As tensions persisted, some counter-protesters attempted to block the march, and further altercations occurred throughout the day. The police remained focused on ensuring safety while facilitating the protests.
