Twelve local eateries and shops scored five-star food hygiene ratings in October, as per the Food Standards Agency (FSA). This top rating signals that a venue’s hygiene standards are 'very good' and comply fully with legal requirements. To achieve this, businesses must excel in how they handle food, their physical condition, and how they manage food safety processes and training. 

The twelve businesses that earned these top marks include Battambang, Dolphin, George and Dragon, Hing Wah, Indian Tiffin Room, Matcha Lab Ltd, New Woks, The Burger Van Urban Food, The Cheshire Food Co., The Elizabethan, The Good Prep, and The Hinds Head. 

Inspections are carried out by local councils, with more frequent checks for those deemed higher risk. For more details on these eateries, check out the embedded links in the list. Don’t forget to subscribe to Stockport Nub News for the latest updates!
