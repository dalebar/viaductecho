Greater Manchester is seeing a rise in house prices in certain areas, contrasting with the UK trend of slight declines. On average, UK house prices dropped by £794 (0.3%) in September with a typical property value sitting at £298,184. However, 10 postcodes in Greater Manchester are experiencing significant surges, with price increases over 10%. 

Firswood leads the charge, with a staggering 32.8% rise, averaging £320,565. Haigh follows with a 19.1% increase to £235,404. Not far behind, Chadderton, Bardsley, and Little Hulton have seen rises of 16.6%, 15.3%, and 11.7% respectively. 

Harpurhey, Littleborough, Stalybridge, Abram, and Whitefield also feature on the list, with increases ranging from 10.9% to 11.6%. These hotspots indicate strong demand and limited supply in the housing market, making them prime locations for prospective buyers.
