Sale's second-half resurgence led them to a win over the Sharks, ensuring their spot in the last 16 of the Investec Champions Cup. After falling behind to a penalty from Masuku, Sale quickly levelled the score with a try from Ma'asi-White. Looking ahead, they face Toulouse next Saturday at 17:30 GMT, a crucial match for deciding their knockout stage position. The Sharks will wrap up their pool stage with a home game against Clermont earlier on the same day at 13:00. The Sale lineup included Carpenter, Du Preez, and T Curry, with referee Ben Breakspear overseeing the match.
