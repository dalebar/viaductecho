Andy Burnham's got big plans for Oldham, looking to use special powers to kickstart a £70m masterplan that's set to revamp Boundary Park stadium into a multi-sports hub and build 2,000 new homes in the town centre. He aims to establish a Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) to streamline development, speeding up planning and funding processes. The MDC could foster a four-sport centre for football, rugby, cricket, and netball, along with a learning centre for young folks to gain qualifications in related fields. Long-term, the idea includes a 3,000-seater arena for various sports, which could attract 25,000 visitors weekly.

A report highlights that Oldham SportsTown’s regeneration will boost local economy and infrastructure. With urban developers Muse leading the housing project across six brownfield sites, Burnham emphasises the need for Oldham to keep pace with regional developments. Council Leader Coun Arooj Shah notes the initiative will focus on improving lives through sport and education, ensuring community involvement in the process. If all goes to plan, a 'Shadow MDC' could be created by the year's end, transitioning into a full MDC by early 2027 after government approval.
