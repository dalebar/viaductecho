NHS Greater Manchester has issued a warning about rising flu cases, urging residents to prepare for a busier festive season. With GP practices and pharmacies closed on certain holidays, it's crucial to order repeat prescriptions early—at least a week in advance, especially if it overlaps with bank holidays. Chief Pharmacist Kenny Li emphasises the importance of having sufficient medication at home, particularly if you’re visiting family. There’s also a reminder to keep up with winter vaccines to avoid unnecessary NHS visits.

For minor health issues, local pharmacies offer quick support without needing a GP appointment, while the Greater Manchester Dental Helpline and Urgent Eye Care Service provide assistance when dental or eye problems arise. Dr Manisha Kumar encourages everyone to stock up on essential items and seek help only through NHS 111 for guidance on non-emergencies, while reserving A&E for critical situations. Plus, there’s information available regarding funding for home improvements for eligible households. The key takeaway is to be prepared to enjoy the festive period without health hiccups!
