Expect 20-40 mm of rain widely, with 50-80 mm on higher ground, and up to 120 mm in the Cumbrian fells. Strong south to southwesterly winds may accompany the rain, particularly near coasts and high ground. The warning will now end at 11.59pm on Monday, instead of the originally planned 3am on Tuesday. This warning also extends to parts of the North West, East Midlands, Scottish Borders, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humber. An amber warning has been issued for parts of Wales, anticipating 100-120 mm of rain on the highest ground, while other areas in Wales might see 20-40 mm.
