Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, addressed speculation about a leadership challenge to Keir Starmer during his speech at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool. He stressed his support for Starmer’s government while advocating for a debate on changing the voting system to proportional representation. Burnham's recent interviews, outlining policies he wishes Labour to adopt, have fueled rumours about his ambitions. He participated in a rally promoting electoral reform, where he delivered a 15-minute speech without notes, engaging the audience directly and urging a discussion about the party's direction. He pushed back against calls for him to pledge loyalty without debate, insisting his intentions are to represent the concerns of local councillors and party members, not personal ambition. Burnham expressed optimism about Labour's potential to succeed and "win again at the next general election," emphasising the need for hope in the country’s direction.
