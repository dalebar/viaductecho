St Thomas' Gardens in Stockport has hit a major milestone with the final slate placed on its highest roof, marking a significant step in revitalising a site that’s been empty for over 15 years. The development will feature an 82-bed care facility alongside eight supported housing units for those needing a little help post-hospital. Additionally, there will be 68 new homes, some of which will be affordable, all aimed at creating a vibrant intergenerational community. Funded by Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Homes England, and led by Stockport Council, the project is seen as a model for integrated living spaces combining homes, health, and community. Council leaders are excited about restoring the historic site and envisioning a bright future for all Stockport residents with this regeneration effort. It’s all part of their ambitious plan to deliver 8,000 new town centre homes in the next 15 years.
