The scaffolding around Manchester’s historic town hall is finally coming down after more than three years of construction work. This painstaking renovation, which began in 2018 and is set to cost £430 million (over £76 million more than initially planned), aims to restore the iconic Grade I-listed building to its former glory. The council's deputy leader, Garry Bridges, describes the project as complicated but essential for preserving a nationally important heritage site.

Currently, over 300 workers are involved, methodically removing sections of the canopy and scaffolding, which protects the roof while extensive repairs are conducted. More than 100,000 original roof slates have been hand-replaced, and all 37 chimney stacks have been restored using matching sandstone. The project also includes enhancing decorative elements, installing a new LED lighting system, and restoring around 1,200 windows.

As work continues, there's optimism that a section could be unveiled by the Christmas markets. It’s a much-anticipated return for the cherished landmark, which originally opened in 1877.
