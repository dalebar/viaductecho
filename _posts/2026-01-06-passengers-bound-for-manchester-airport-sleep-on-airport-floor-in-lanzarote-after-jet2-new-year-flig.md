Holidaymakers returning to Manchester Airport faced a chaotic experience after their Jet2 flight from Lanzarote was cancelled due to weather. Passengers were left stranded at the airport overnight, with some sleeping on floors and suitcases as food and drink became scarce. Carl Bickerton, a passenger on the flight, described how they boarded the plane only to remain on it for four hours before being sent back to the terminal. The airport shut down at midnight, leading to frustration as hotel accommodations were hard to find. Despite efforts from a Jet2 manager to assist passengers, many were left in tears and without necessary medications. After a lengthy delay, most eventually boarded a new flight around noon on Sunday, while others who secured hotel rooms faced additional issues. Jet2 has acknowledged the situation, and the airport stated that assistance for passengers falls under the airlines’ responsibility.
