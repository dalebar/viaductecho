Two men have been arrested after a wild car chase in Wythenshawe following a knife-point robbery at a Tesco in Hadfield. The police were alerted to the robbery where staff were threatened, and the suspects fled in a grey Audi. After spotting the Audi in Wythenshawe, police pursued the vehicle, which hit over 80mph in a 30mph zone. The Audi was eventually abandoned on tram tracks at Benchill tram stop, with two men attempting to escape on foot, but they were quickly apprehended. One man in his 30s was arrested for dangerous driving and robbery, while another in his 40s was snared for robbery. Both men have been returned to prison. However, a third suspect is still on the run, and Derbyshire Police are asking anyone who may have dashcam footage from the route taken by the Audi to get in touch.
