Freddie Flintoff is kick-starting a £1.1m campaign to create a new cinema, the MediCinema, for hospitals in Manchester, aiming to bring joy to patients, especially kids at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. He’s asking everyone in Greater Manchester to chip in £2 to help reach the target by Christmas. The plan is for a 50-seat, accessible cinema with features like audio descriptions and sensory-friendly screenings, all set up in an old lecture theatre at Manchester Royal Infirmary. With around 260 films planned to be shown each year, this state-of-the-art space will provide much-needed entertainment for patients, particularly those facing lengthy hospital stays. Flintoff believes it’ll be a fantastic Christmas gift for the city, saying that simple moments like watching a film can mean the world to families during tough times. The campaign aims to ensure it won’t cost the NHS extra to run. Donations can be made by texting CINEMA and the amount to 70580 or visiting the charity's website.
