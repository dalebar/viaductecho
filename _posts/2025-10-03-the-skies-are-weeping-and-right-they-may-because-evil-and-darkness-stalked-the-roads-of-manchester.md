Rabbi Daniel Walker from Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation spoke at a vigil following a tragic terror attack on his synagogue that resulted in two deaths during Yom Kippur. He expressed gratitude towards the heroic individuals who prevented further harm and the emergency services for their swift response. In his emotional speech, he highlighted the need for the Jewish community to remain strong, urging them to continue their prayers and charitable acts in the face of evil. He emphasised that the attack should prompt both practical and spiritual responses. Despite the darkness of the situation, he rallying urged the community to persevere, stating that they have always rebuilt and returned stronger after adversity. Rabbi Walker also acknowledged the support from non-Jewish communities, expressing heartfelt thanks for their solidarity during this difficult time. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police shortly after the incident, which involved a car ramming and stabbings outside the synagogue. The two victims, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were named, with several others still hospitalised with serious injuries.
