Plans for a one-way traffic system in Ramsbottom town centre have been scrapped following a massive backlash from locals, with over 1,500 responses overwhelmingly negative. The Bury council had suggested the changes under the 'Streets For All' scheme to improve safety and reduce congestion, but residents voiced their concerns during public consultations. Many argued the idea was impractical and would worsen traffic issues. Local councillor Gareth Staples-Jones echoed the community’s worries and confirmed that the council is now focusing on road safety improvements that were actually supported by residents. Others expressed relief at the decision on social media, questioning the initial proposal's cost. The council plans to shift its attention to enhancing cycling and walking routes to benefit the town centre. Coun Eamonn O’Brien emphasised the importance of community feedback in shaping future plans.
