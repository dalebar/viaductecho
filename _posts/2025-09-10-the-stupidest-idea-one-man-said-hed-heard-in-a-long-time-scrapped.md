Plans for a one-way system in Ramsbottom town centre have been scrapped after residents overwhelmingly opposed the idea. Proposed changes aimed to make Bridge Street one-way up to Bolton Street and Kay Brow one-way down to Railway Street while suggesting other improvements like new crossings, better pavements, and a 20mph speed limit. However, over 1,500 people responded negatively during discussions and public meetings, with many expressing concerns about increased traffic and congestion. Councillor Gareth Staples-Jones supported scrapping the one-way system and stated that he and other local councillors listened to the community's views. While the one-way plan was rejected, Bury Council will focus on the road safety improvements that received community backing and explore better cycling and walking routes. Local leaders highlighted the importance of community feedback in shaping decisions.
