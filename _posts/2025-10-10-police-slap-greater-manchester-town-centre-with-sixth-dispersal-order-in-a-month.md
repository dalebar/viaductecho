Wigan town centre has faced its sixth 48-hour dispersal order in a month due to a rise in crime and anti-social behaviour. This follows serious stabbing incidents involving a 42-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy at Wigan Interchange on September 11. Greater Manchester Police have identified 15 youths linked to recent issues in the area and have visited their parents as a first step in enforcement. The dispersal order, effective from 6 PM on October 10 to 5:59 PM on October 12, allows police to direct individuals engaged in criminal activity to leave the area. Officers have been reviewing CCTV footage and collaborating with local initiatives to address these concerns. If the youths and their families donâ€™t comply with guidance, they could face arrests and further legal consequences. Meanwhile, the Manchester Evening News encourages readers to stay updated on local stories and offers various ways to engage with their content.
