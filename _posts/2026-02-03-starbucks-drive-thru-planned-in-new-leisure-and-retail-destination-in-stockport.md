Plans for a new leisure and retail spot in Stockport could include a drive-thru Starbucks and an 80-bed residential care home. The proposed site, near Hempshaw Lane and St Mary's Way, would have the Starbucks on the southern side and the care home on the northern part, both accessible from Brundrett Street. The plans entail demolishing existing office buildings and include around 24 parking spaces for the coffee shop, plus additional parking for the care home. Concerns were raised about potential noise and odour from the drive-thru and customer activity, but the proposal aims to enhance the area by attracting more visitors and generating activity throughout the week. Stockport council plans to make a decision on the application by April 22.
