Stockport is considering plans for a new drive-thru Starbucks as part of a leisure and retail development near the town centre, off Hempshaw Lane and St Mary’s Way. The proposal includes an 80-bed residential care home, with the Starbucks situated to the south of the site. It features a drive-thru lane with parking for around 24 customers and access from Brundrett Street. Currently, the area has empty office buildings that would be demolished if approved. Concerns have been raised regarding potential noise and odour from customers and deliveries, but the developers argue it will enhance the area and attract more visitors. The proposed care home would include a large enclosed garden with parking for residents and staff. Stockport council aims to make a decision by April 22.
