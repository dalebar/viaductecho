The Manchester Film Festival, running from 19-29 March, promises 10 days of compelling storytelling, exciting premieres, and inspiring discussions, founded by Neil Jeram-Croft in 2015. This year’s event, the most ambitious yet, will showcase over 52 feature films, featuring a mix of A-listers like Adam Driver, Angelina Jolie, and Cate Blanchett alongside talented local filmmakers. It’s a BAFTA and BIFA qualifying festival celebrating independent cinema, with screenings at venues across Manchester like HOME and Odeon Great Northern. 

Highlights include world premieres of standout films like the LGBTQ+ sci-fi drama "Chatlines," co-directed by local talents, and "Synthesized," a music-driven exploration of ambition. Another notable entry is "The Old Man and the Sea," a unique take on a classic story starring Oldham FC chairman Frank Rothwell. Tickets are required for events, and most films are rated 15 or below. For more details, check the festival’s website or follow BBC Manchester for updates!
