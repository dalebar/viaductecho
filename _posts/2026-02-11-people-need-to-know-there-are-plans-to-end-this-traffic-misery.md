Stockport commuters are dealing with frustrating traffic jams, prompting calls for enhanced public transport options. Local MP Lisa Smart and Councillor Wendy Meikle are urging for improvements, especially with the upcoming Metrolink service meant to boost connectivity around the borough. Councillor Meikle pointed out that some bus journeys take up to an hour, while driving can still mean delays, creating a pressing need for reliable transport alternatives. TfGM is collaborating with Stockport Council to develop a business case for extending Metrolink from east Didsbury to Stockport town centre, with plans to enhance links to Tameside and Manchester Airport. They aim to submit this case to the government in 2026, with construction possibly starting by the end of the decade. There’s a clear push for better transport options to alleviate traffic woes and help residents navigate the area more easily.
