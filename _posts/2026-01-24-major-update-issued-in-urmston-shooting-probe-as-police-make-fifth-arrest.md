A fifth man has been arrested in connection with a shooting in Urmston, Trafford, which occurred on January 16. Emergency services responded after receiving a 999 call reporting the incident, and a 21-year-old man was found with a gunshot wound. He's currently in a stable but critical condition in hospital. Alongside this latest arrest, a 38-year-old man was previously detained on suspicion of attempted murder and conspiracy, while four other men aged between 18 and 28 were also arrested earlier in the week. They have since been bailed as investigations continue. Detective Chief Inspector Justin Bryant reassured the public that the police are actively addressing the violence and have made significant progress in the case, encouraging anyone with relevant information to come forward.
