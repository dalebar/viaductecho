Greater Manchester councils are optimistic about upcoming changes in local authority funding thanks to the government's Fair Funding Review 2.0. This overhaul aims to replace outdated funding formulas, focusing on deprivation data and local needs, supposedly benefiting areas like Bury and Bolton. Bury's leader, Eamonn O'Brien, noted that the link to deprivation is crucial, while Bolton's leader, Nick Peel, emphasised the need to rectify past funding imbalances, especially for services impacted by austerity. The government promises a £5bn boost for local services over the next three years to help level the playing field, addressing long-standing disparities where less deprived councils have amassed reserves at the expense of others. Officials expect detailed allocations for individual councils to be released in December, with a hope that this new fairer funding will allow councils to restore important services. The changes intend to redistribute funds significantly, with Manchester and nearby authorities anticipated to gain the most from the reforms.
