Queues were forming at the Trafford Centre this morning as shoppers dove into the Boxing Day sales, keen to snag discounts from high street favourites. Many stores, including Next, opted to stay closed today to give staff a breather. Retailers had kicked off deals even before the 26th, some as early as December 23. 

At the Trafford Centre, shops opened at 8am with Boots and Zara leading the charge, while Selfridges' sale began at 9am, attracting its usual crowds. The Arndale Centre saw a quieter morning, save for a long queue at the popular Lush store. 

The tradition of Boxing Day sales gained traction in the late '90s when trading laws changed, and Boxing Day became a Bank Holiday in 1974. This year, reports suggest that it's the busiest Boxing Day in ages. John Lewis starts its sales at 10am and M&S and Next will join in with sales from December 27. Keep an eye on the bustling Texas as shoppers continue to embrace the sales!
