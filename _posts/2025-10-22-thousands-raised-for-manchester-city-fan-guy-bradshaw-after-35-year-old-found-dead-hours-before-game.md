A fundraiser for Guy Bradshaw, a Manchester City fan who tragically died while in Spain for a Champions League match, is nearing its £25,000 target just 24 hours in. The 35-year-old was discovered dead hours before the game in his apartment. Tributes have been pouring in, describing him as gentle and kind. An anonymous donor contributed a staggering £8,500 to support his grieving family. Guy leaves behind his 12-year-old daughter, Ava, and was well-known in Wythenshawe for his love of City. His father, Martin, noted the outpouring of support from fans and the club during this difficult time. The cause of death remains unconfirmed, but authorities have indicated no suspicious circumstances. Guy’s sudden passing has left his family and friends devastated, and they face costs associated with repatriating his body due to a lack of travel insurance. The football community has come together in remembrance, sharing heartfelt messages on social media, marking the loss of a dedicated supporter.
