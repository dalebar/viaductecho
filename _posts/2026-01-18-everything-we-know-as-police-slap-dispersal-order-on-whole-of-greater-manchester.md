Police in Greater Manchester have enforced a dispersal order due to planned car meetings, following a tragic crash in Bolton that claimed four lives last weekend. Starting at 3:30pm today and lasting until 5am Monday, this order gives officers the power to remove anyone suspected of anti-social behaviour. While specific times and locations for these gatherings haven't been shared, the focus is on preventing large, potentially dangerous crowds. Chief Inspector John Haywood highlighted that these car meets can often lead to risky actions, stressing the importance of public safety after recent events. Authorities aim to minimise disruption and address community concerns, urging anyone thinking of attending such events to reconsider their impact. The overall goal is to protect the community and avoid further tragedies.
