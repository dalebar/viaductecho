Plans have been proposed to knock down the B&M Bargains store in Sale to put up a five to six-storey block with 69 apartments. Ropley Properties Ltd wants Trafford council’s planning team to review their “screening opinion” for the Broad Road site. The new building would have one and two-bed flats that ‘step down’ in height towards the west, aiming to blend in with surrounding buildings. There'll also be a residents' garden, and parking will mainly stay in the rear, providing 22 spaces with adjusted access from Wharf Road for refuse collection. DPP Planning, on behalf of Ropley, assures that their designs comply with Trafford’s guidelines and the National Planning Policy Framework. The site is centrally located near various amenities, including the Sale Leisure Centre and a multi-storey car park.
