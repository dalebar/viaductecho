A tragic attack at a Manchester synagogue on Thursday resulted in two Jewish deaths and three injuries. The suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie, has been identified by police. In response, additional police presence will be seen at synagogues nationwide, with heightened patrols in London as well. Officers quickly declared a major incident after reports of a car targeting the public. Rabbi Daniel Walker and synagogue security are praised for their quick action in leading congregants to safety during the service. Sir Keir Starmer cut short a European summit to address the situation, visiting a synagogue afterwards. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham condemned the attack, expressing deep condolences to the victims and highlighting the horrific nature of the antisemitic incident.
