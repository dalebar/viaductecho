Chancellor Rachel Reeves has revealed extra government funding to bolster security for religious communities after a surge in hate crimes against Jewish and Muslim worshippers. This announcement came during her visit to Heaton Park Synagogue in Manchester, where a terror attack occurred on October 2, 2025. Reeves expressed the government’s commitment to ensuring the safety of those attending synagogues and mosques. The funding breakdown includes £28.4 million for synagogues, Jewish schools, and community centres via the Jewish Community Protective Security Grant, and £40 million for mosques and Muslim institutions through the Protective Security for Mosques Scheme. The funds will enhance security with measures like CCTV, fencing, alarms, floodlights, and on-site staff. An additional £5 million is also set aside for protecting other faith sites, including those of Christians, Hindus, and Sikhs. During her visit, Reeves met with Alan Levy, the synagogue chair who heroically barricaded the door during the attack, alongside Rabbi Daniel Walker and other community leaders.
