Oxford Road station, a Grade-II listed building, hasn't changed much since its last renovation in 1960, still retaining its Art Deco charm and chilly platforms. However, plans are afoot for a major revamp that could transform the area, which includes the former Cornerhouse and Screen One buildings. Manchester Council aims to create a more inviting entryway into the city centre, moving away from the current run-down appearance. The Cornerhouse, cherished by locals and once a cultural hotspot, has been closed for a decade, leaving a nostalgic gap in Manchester's landscape. Meanwhile, the town hall restoration is progressing, though over-budget, with hopes to reveal its new look ahead of Christmas markets.
