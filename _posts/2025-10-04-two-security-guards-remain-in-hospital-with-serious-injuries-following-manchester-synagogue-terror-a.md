Two security personnel remain seriously injured in hospital following a terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester. The attack happened on Yom Kippur, where two worshippers, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, tragically lost their lives. Police clarified that Cravitz was not a security guard but a congregant at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation. Daulby attempted to stop the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, and was shot by armed police in the process. Al-Shamie, who was on bail for an alleged rape, was fatally shot during the incident after being confronted by security. As investigations continue, counter-terrorism officers are questioning six suspects related to the attack. Protests planned in Manchester and London have sparked debate, with calls for respect towards the grieving Jewish community. A minute of silence for the victims will be held at Old Trafford during a Manchester United match. The police are also looking into the lethal force used during the incident and are assessing Al-Shamie's extremist influences.
