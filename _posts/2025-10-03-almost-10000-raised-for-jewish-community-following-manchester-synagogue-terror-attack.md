A fundraiser, led by Andrew Fox, has raised nearly £10,000 to support the Jewish community after a recent terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue, with a target of £12,000 set on GoFundMe. All donations will go to the Community Security Trust (CST), a charity focused on protecting the community from antisemitism and terrorism. The campaign highlights the ongoing threats faced by the Jewish community since October 7 and emphasizes the importance of solidarity during these tough times. Tragically, two people lost their lives in the attack, and several others were injured. The suspect has been identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, with a terror-related motive being investigated. Additional arrests have been made in connection to the attack. Police are increasing their presence in the area for public safety.
