The Stockport town centre Post Office is moving to TGJones on 30 October, relocating from its current spot on Great Underbank. The existing Post Office will stay open until 11 November, allowing both locations to assist during the transition. Thereâ€™ll be reduced services at TGJones initially, while regular services continue at the current site. Once fully operational, the new Post Office will be open Monday to Saturday for about 46.5 hours weekly, with hours set for 9am to 5.30pm on weekdays and 9am to 1pm on Saturdays. TGJones, which became independent from WHSmith in June, will host the Post Office on the first floor, featuring open plan serving positions and temporary counters at first, with self-service machines coming later. This move is part of a shift towards a 'fully franchised network', aiming for a sustainable future for locales like Stockport.
