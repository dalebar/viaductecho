Tragic news from Cheshire as a person has died on the railway tracks near Sandbach station around 10:20am on January 9. The authorities were called to the scene but, sadly, the individual was declared dead. British Transport Police confirmed the death isn't suspicious and a report is being prepared for the coroner. Specific details about the deceased haven’t been shared yet. Meanwhile, the railway line between Stockport and Crewe is closed, impacting several services, such as those run by Transport for Wales, Avanti West Coast, and Northern, leading to delays, cancellations, and diversions.

In times like these, it’s vital to remember there are support services available. The Samaritans (116 123) offer help 24/7, and other organisations such as CALM and the Greater Manchester Bereavement Service provide valuable support for those struggling through grief or mental health issues. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you or anyone you know is in need of support.
