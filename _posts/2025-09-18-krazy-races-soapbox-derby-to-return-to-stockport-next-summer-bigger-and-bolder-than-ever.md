A big free soapbox derby, Krazy Races, is back in Stockport on Sunday, 9 August 2026, after its successful runs in 2023 and 2024. Expect about 20 teams racing their homemade soapboxes from St Peter's Square to Chestergate, with prizes for speed, design, and creativity. The event supports local charities, having raised nearly £20,000 last time for causes like The Christie cancer centre and St Ann's Hospice. Danny Scoffin from Krazy Races has promised an even bigger and better event this time around, incorporating new features from their tours. More details on participation can be found on the Krazy Races website. It’s set to be a brilliant day out!
