The M60 was shut down anti-clockwise from about 2.30pm on Thursday, 8 July, while emergency services attended to a welfare concern. The A6 bridge over the motorway was also closed off as Greater Manchester Police managed the situation. Thankfully, everything was sorted by around 4.30pm, and the roads reopened, although there was still some traffic congestion along the A6 for a bit afterward.
