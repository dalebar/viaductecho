A new comedy series, "Small Prophets," featuring Sir Michael Palin and Mackenzie Crook, is set to air on BBC Two. Filmed in Greater Manchester, mainly around Urmston and Stockport, the show follows Michael, played by Pearce Quigley, as he searches for answers about his girlfriend’s disappearance. His father, depicted by Palin, shares a quirky recipe involving rainwater and horse manure that leads to some rather unexpected events in their garden shed.

Crook, who wrote and directed the six-part series, took a decade to develop the story, initially inspired by the idea of creatures grown in jars. He expressed excitement about filming in the North and the warm reception from locals. Residents, including Sally Sadler, found the filming experience surreal and memorable. Cast member Lauren Patel shared her joy in filming where she grew up, while Quigley enjoyed more family time. 

"Small Prophets" launches on Monday, 9 February at 22:00 GMT on BBC Two and will be available on BBC iPlayer.
