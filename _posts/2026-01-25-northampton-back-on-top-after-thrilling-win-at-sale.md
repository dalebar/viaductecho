Northampton Saints are back at the top of The Prem after a thrilling match against Sale Sharks, featuring a whopping 11 tries! It was a heavyweight battle, with 11 players from England's Six Nations squad involved. Saints kicked off strongly, and their forward pack took charge, culminating in a key try from hooker Smith. Sale's director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, commented on the match afterwards. 

Sale's lineup included Carpenter, O'Flaherty, R du Preez, Ma'asi-White, Wills, Ford, Quirke, Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, van Rhyn, Bamber, Vermuelen, Dugdale, and T Curry.
