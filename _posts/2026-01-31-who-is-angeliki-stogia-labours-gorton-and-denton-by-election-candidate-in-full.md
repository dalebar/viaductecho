The Labour Party has picked Angeliki Stogia as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election, which takes place on February 26, following the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne. Stogia, who has been a Labour councillor for Whalley Range since 2012, has a solid background in transport, environment, and regeneration policy. Originally from Greece, she moved to the UK in the '90s to study at Manchester Metropolitan University and became a British citizen. Stogia's political journey began as a response to government policies she disagreed with in 2010, leading her to stand for local council elections. During her time, she notably spoke out on issues like active travel during the pandemic. Despite Andy Burnham's hopes to represent Labour in this by-election, he was blocked by the party's ruling committee. Other candidates from the Green Party, Liberal Democrats, and Reform have also been announced for the election.
