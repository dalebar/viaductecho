The Jalalia Jaame Mosque in Rochdale is set for an expansion and redesign, aimed at serving the community better. Initially built in the 1970s, the mosque plans to remove its current dome and minaret for a modern look. Key additions include a first-floor extension, improved facilities, and a revamped prayer space. Local councillor Coun Iftikhar Ahmed backed the project, highlighting its benefits for children's education and women's access, as current changing facilities are lacking. Although council planning officers labelled it ‘overdevelopment’ due to concerns about its impact on the surrounding area, the planning committee felt these issues were already present and wouldn’t worsen with the changes. The mosque's representatives outlined sustainable features like solar panels and rainwater harvesting. Some committee members suggested extra conditions, including traffic assessments, before granting approval. Ultimately, the committee voted in favour of the mosque’s expansion, believing it will significantly benefit the local community.
