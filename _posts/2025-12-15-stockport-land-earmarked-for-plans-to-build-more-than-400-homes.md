Over 400 new homes are in the pipeline around Stockport, with plans submitted to the council. In High Lane, up to 250 homes are proposed off Windlehurst Road, near the Macclesfield Canal. The masterplan includes open spaces, landscaping, and ease of access, benefiting from nearby services and walking routes to local amenities. Meanwhile, in Bramhall, a separate plan for 195 homes on green belt land off Lytham Drive is underway, with half designated as affordable housing. Both projects are currently being assessed for their environmental impact as part of the pre-application process. Stockport aims to build 25,000 homes by 2042 under its draft local plan, which highlights potential sites on the green belt for future development. A consultation on this plan runs until December 21.
