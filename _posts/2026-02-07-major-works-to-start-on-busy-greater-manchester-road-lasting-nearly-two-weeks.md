Major resurfacing works on Liverpool Road in Salford are due to start on February 9 and will last nearly two weeks. The road will be subject to one-way closures between 8pm and 6am on specific nights and multi-way signals during the daytime on some days. Motorists are advised to allow extra travel time and follow on-site signs. This is part of wider infrastructure upgrades, including new flood prevention measures aimed at addressing chronic flooding issues in the area, particularly on Peel Green Road. From March 2 to April 19, Peel Green Road will be closed 24/7 at the Haddon Road junction as United Utilities installs a new drainage pipe to improve network capacity. Local councillors are actively pushing for solutions to ongoing flooding, with residents expressing frustration over repeated incidents. United Utilities has committed to collaborating with local authorities to tackle these concerns effectively.
