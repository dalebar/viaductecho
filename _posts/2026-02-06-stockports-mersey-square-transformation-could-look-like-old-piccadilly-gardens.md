Stockport's Mersey Square is set for a makeover, with plans for new greenery and a children’s play area, reminiscent of the old Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester. The council aims to revamp the square for the first time in years to make it more inviting, both day and night. The bear pit, which has historical significance, will be transformed into a central focal point. This effort is part of a £1bn regeneration project in Stockport, which includes improved walking and cycling routes linking various areas of the town centre. Councillors have expressed excitement about the plans, highlighting their potential to create a vibrant community space for events and gatherings. There's also a public consultation running until February 25 to gather local input on the proposed changes.
