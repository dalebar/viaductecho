Work is progressing on a new fire station in Stockport, set to open in autumn next year. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) recently marked a milestone by signing the beams for the new King Street West site, part of a £51m investment in three new fire stations across Greater Manchester. The previous Stockport fire station was demolished in August, with crews temporarily operating from Whitehill Community Fire Station. The new station will be named 'Stockport Central Community Fire Station'. Deputy Mayor Kate Green highlighted the importance of maintaining fire cover during construction, while GMFRS’s assistant chief fire officer, Sarah Nattrass, expressed pride in the modern facilities being created to enhance community engagement and support staff. Upgrades to other stations, including a new Blackley station opening in late November and a Whitefield station by autumn 2026, are also underway.
