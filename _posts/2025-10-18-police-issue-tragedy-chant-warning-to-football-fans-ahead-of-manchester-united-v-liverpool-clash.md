Ahead of the Manchester United vs Liverpool match on October 19, Merseyside Police have issued a warning about 'tragedy chanting', which has led to arrests in past encounters. They've collaborated with both clubs to ensure safety for the expected 60,000 fans, employing visible and covert patrols. Chief Inspector Geoff Stewart highlighted that chanting about tragedies is disrespectful and will not be tolerated, as it causes distress to the families affected. Last time, eight arrests were made for this offence. The police aim to act as a deterrent, stressing that offenders risk criminal records and football bans. Fans are encouraged to be ambassadors for their clubs, plan their journeys early, and use public transport while remaining vigilant. The hope is for everyone to enjoy a memorable match responsibly.
