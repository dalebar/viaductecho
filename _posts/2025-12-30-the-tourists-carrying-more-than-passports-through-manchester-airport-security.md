This Christmas, Manchester Airport is set to see a surge in tourists, but not all arrivals are in the holiday spirit. A series of recent arrests highlight the risks of smuggling drugs through security. 

Lauren Martin, 24, was stopped after returning from Thailand with 31 vacuum-sealed packs of cannabis hidden in her suitcase. Another passenger, Larissa Lins, 27, faced arrest when photos on her phone revealed she had smuggled a kilogram of drugs internally and externally after claiming to be researching holiday spots.

Then there were Sophie Bannister and Levi-April Whalley, who had over 35kg of cannabis in their luggage after a trip to New York. Edward Nesbitt, a 36-year-old former boxer, was caught with 23 kilos of cannabis, while Uber driver Yoke Woon came from Singapore with a similar stash. 

Lastly, Archie Payne, 26, was caught with over 20kg of cannabis after claiming he was pressured into smuggling due to gambling debts. Gary Lindley, a window cleaner, mistakenly thought he was carrying cash worth £9,000 but ended up with drugs instead. It seems the airport's pretty busy this holiday season, making more than just festive memories.
