Andy Burnham's got big plans to reindustrialise Manchester, the birthplace of the industrial revolution. He revealed a strategy focusing on five key Greater Manchester areas, each catering to different sectors, promising locals clarity on job prospects outside the bustling city centre. Dubbed 'Manchesterism', the plan highlights 'growth clusters': a digital, cyber, and AI hub in the city centre; a life sciences cluster near Oxford Road's institutions; a creative and media sector at MediaCity; plus emerging clusters for low carbon in Carrington, Trafford, and advanced manufacturing in Atom Valley, covering Bury, Oldham, and Rochdale. The aim? Create thousands of homes, tens of thousands of jobs, and boost the economy beyond £100bn. Burnham is confident these clusters are tangible, noting that substantial groundwork is already in place, with plans for expansion. He emphasised the need for a new political culture—one that diverges from Westminster's top-down approach—to foster sustainable growth and tackle the north-south divide.
