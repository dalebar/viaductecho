A 22-year-old man, Keaton Winder, has been charged after police raids in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester. He was arrested on February 12 on suspicion of drug offences, including the supply of crack cocaine and heroin, and possession with intent to supply these substances. He also faces charges for possessing an offensive weapon and criminal property. Winder is currently in custody and is set to appear in Manchester Magistrates Court today. GMP's Programme Challenger team led the investigation, urging the public to report any local drug dealing activities—either directly or anonymously through Crimestoppers.
