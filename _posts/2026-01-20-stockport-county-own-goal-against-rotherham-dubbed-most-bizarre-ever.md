Stockport County had a bit of a laugh and a gasp during their match against Rotherham United on 17 January, which featured what some are calling 'the most bizarre own goal ever'. Keeper Ben Hinchliffe attempted a long kick but accidentally booted the ball into teammate Joe Olowu, leading to a rebound that found its way into County's net, leveling the score at 1-1. Despite this rare mishap, which was labelled both 'hilarious' and 'remarkable', County secured a 3-2 victory, with Rotherham also contributing to the tally with two own goals. This win marks County's third straight, vital for their promotion ambitions. Next up, they’ll face Cardiff City on 24 January.
