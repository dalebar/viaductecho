Liam Gallagher joined The Stone Roses at Manchester Cathedral to honour bassist Gary 'Mani' Mounfield, who passed away in November at age 63. The emotional funeral drew a massive crowd of friends, fans, and rock icons, celebrating Mani's influence in music. Liam, alongside Ian Brown, John Squire, and Alan 'Reni' Wren, helped carry Mani's coffin, which featured Squire's iconic artwork. The procession began with The Stone Roses' classic, "Made of Stone," echoing through the streets. Ian's heartfelt tribute highlighted Mani's impact on everyone he met and expressed the profound loss felt by the community. Mani, remembered as "the essential Mancunian," had a vast network of friends, including Paul Weller, David Beckham, and many others from the music scene. Their speeches reflected admiration for his spirit and legacy, with calls for a statue in his honour. Born in Crumpsall, Mani's journey spanned from the Stone Roses to Primal Scream, leaving a significant mark on Manchester's musical heritage.
