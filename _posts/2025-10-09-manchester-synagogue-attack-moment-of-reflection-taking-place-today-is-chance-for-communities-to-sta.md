Today marks a national day of solidarity, a week after the tragic attack on a Manchester synagogue. This "moment of reflection," organised by various faith and community groups, calls for unity in respecting freedom of worship and tolerance. The recent violent incident at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, which claimed the lives of Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, has shocked many. In memory of the victims, communities are encouraged to hold vigils, light candles, and observe moments of silence. Faith and communities minister Miatta Fahnbulleh emphasised the importance of standing together against rising antisemitism and promoting shared values of compassion and understanding. Events will take place across the UK, including a multi-faith vigil at Peterborough Cathedral and support from schools and organizations like the Oasis Charitable Trust, advocating for community togetherness. Julie Siddiqi from the British Muslim Network highlighted the need to combat narratives of hate following not just the synagogue incident but also an arson attack on a mosque. Overall, these acts of solidarity aim to reinforce the message that love and community spirit triumph over hate.
