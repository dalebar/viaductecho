The Met Office has put out two weather warnings for Greater Manchester this weekend due to Storm Goretti's aftermath, which has already caused some chaos with snow, rain, and strong winds. While Greater Manchester mostly dodged the worst, eastern areas experienced some snowfall, leading to train cancellations and closed roads. There's a snow and ice warning in place for Sunday, with an additional ice warning starting this afternoon. Affected areas include Oldham, Rochdale, Tameside, and Stockport, as well as parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire. Forecasts predict a cold night, dropping to -2C, with a 'feels like' temperature even lower. There’s also a risk of freezing fog and further wintry showers, increasing the ice risk. Further snow and ice warnings are in effect across parts of Scotland, the North East, and other regions until tomorrow. It looks like we'll see some snow in Greater Manchester early Sunday, with chilly overnight temperatures before a milder start next week. Stay safe out there!
