Religious communities in north Manchester are calling for an increased police presence following a tragic attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue during Yom Kippur, which resulted in the deaths of two men. The police have boosted patrols around local synagogues and community centres in response to rising fears of anti-Semitism and hate crimes, which have notably increased against various faiths, including a 19% rise in incidents targeting Muslims. Community members, including those from Muslim and Sikh backgrounds, have expressed concerns about safety and the need for stronger police visibility to protect places of worship. Officers are actively engaging with local religious leaders and the public to address these worries. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood recently emphasised the importance of combatting any form of violence against communities, stating that such attacks threaten the unity and tolerance that define the UK. Community meetings are being held to discuss these issues and enhance safety measures.
