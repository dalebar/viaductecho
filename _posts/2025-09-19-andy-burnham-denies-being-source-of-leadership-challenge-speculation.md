Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, hasn't dismissed the idea of returning to Westminster, but he's not stirring up rumors about challenging Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. Speaking on BBC Radio Manchester, he mentioned that ongoing speculations are due to the instability in Westminster, adding that he's not the one feeding these stories to the press. While he acknowledges he hasn't ruled out a future in Westminster, he emphasised his commitment to his current role in Greater Manchester and his ongoing efforts, like supporting the Hillsborough Law negotiations. Burnham stated that if a political move were to happen, it would need to come from others rather than him actively seeking it out.
