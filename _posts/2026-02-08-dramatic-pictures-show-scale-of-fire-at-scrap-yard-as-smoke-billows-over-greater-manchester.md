Dramatic photos have surfaced from a huge fire at a scrap yard in Trafford on February 8, believed to involve a large amount of scrap metal. Fire crews and police quickly arrived at the J Davidson site on Craven Road, with massive smoke plumes visible across Greater Manchester. Residents were advised to avoid the area and keep windows shut. It turns out this site had a similar large fire just 11 months prior. 

The Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service dispatched five fire engines and one aerial ladder platform after the fire broke out around 2.40pm. Firefighters, in breathing apparatus, were on-site using two hose reel jets to control the flames. Local roads were closed off as emergency services worked to contain the situation, with videos from the area capturing the smoke clouds overhead.
