A Manchester bakery, created as a "safe and social space" for the LGBTQ+ community, has thrived over 13 years, leading to numerous marriages and strong friendships. Members of all skills are invited to bring their homemade treats like cakes and pies for a friendly meet-up. While it's not a competition, regulars Jim and Paul enjoy bringing their best efforts. Mr Sargeant, the bakery's founder, was nominated for a BBC North West Christmas Star award, recognising his dedication to the group, as highlighted by member Stuart Williams. For more community vibes, tune into BBC Radio Manchester and check their socials!
