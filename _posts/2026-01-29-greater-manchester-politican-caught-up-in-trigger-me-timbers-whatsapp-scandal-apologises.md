Nearly a year after the WhatsApp scandal in Greater Manchester, Coun Brenda Warrington has finally spoken out ahead of a standards committee hearing next week. She was part of the controversial 'Trigger Me Timbers' group, which included offensive messages leading to suspensions of various Labour councillors and MPs. The upcoming hearing will address serious allegations of racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, and even threats of violence from the chat. Coun Warrington intends to raise questions about the investigation's scope and costs. Despite the prolonged abuse and misinformation she faced, she honoured the Labour Party’s directive not to comment publicly until now. She offers a heartfelt apology for any distress caused by her remarks in the private chat, clarifying that it was never her intention to offend. The 94-page investigation report outlines the complaints and findings, including her use of a council phone for chat participation and her controversial comments. The committee meeting will determine if there were indeed breaches of the council’s code of conduct.
