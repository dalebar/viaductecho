Police in Cheetham Hill have discovered a massive cannabis farm valued at £1.3 million during a raid on October 5. The operation was part of a wider investigation into organised immigration, modern slavery, and drug supply. Officers found numerous cannabis plants and a fully operational electricity supply in the building on Redbank. Six men have been arrested: four aged between 26 and 35 for cannabis production and immigration offences, while two men aged 42 and 50 face human trafficking charges. All remain in custody as detectives continue their inquiries. Detective Superintendent Joseph Harrop stated the arrests were crucial in preventing drugs from hitting the streets and emphasised GMP's commitment to tackling serious crime. He urged the public to report any suspicious activity, reminding them to call 101 or use the GMP website for non-emergencies, and to dial 999 in emergencies. Anonymity for reports can be maintained through Crime Stoppers.
