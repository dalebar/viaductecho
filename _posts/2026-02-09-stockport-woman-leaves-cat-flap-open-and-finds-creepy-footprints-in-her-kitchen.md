A Stockport woman, Ellie Morton, is in disbelief after discovering strange footprints in her kitchen while she was away. Her dad noticed the muddy prints leading to her cat's food, prompting Ellie to ask for help identifying them. The paw prints, resembling those of a small hand with sharp claws, sparked curiosity online after her TikTok video gained over 700,000 views. Initially thought to be from a fox or badger, Ellie suspects wildlife has been using her cat flap, especially since she's heard it opening and closing when her cat was nearby. While many comments suggest they belong to a badger, some argue the prints resemble boot marks, possibly from Doc Martens. Ellie, however, stands by her belief that they look like badger tracks and has set up an outdoor camera to catch any intruders.
