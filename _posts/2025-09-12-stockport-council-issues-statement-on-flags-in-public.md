Stockport Council leader Mark Roberts has commented on the display of flags in public areas. He stated that flags can stay up as long as they don't pose safety risks or feature slogans. However, flags on lampposts should be removed since they're not intended for this use. Residents are encouraged to display flags at home instead. Repairs will be promptly made for any painted flags on roundabouts or road markings, which pose safety concerns. Cllr Roberts emphasised that incidents of criminal damage will be investigated, and the cost of repairs adds pressure to the Council's budget. The national flag will continue to be flown at the Town Hall as a symbol for all residents.
