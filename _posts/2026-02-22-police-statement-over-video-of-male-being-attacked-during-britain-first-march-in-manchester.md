Police are investigating violence at a Britain First march on Saturday, February 22, after a video showed a man being attacked. The far-right group gathered in Piccadilly for a march supporting 'remigration and mass deportations', while counter-protests occurred, including one led by Jeremy Corbyn. Clips from the event show clashes between protesters, police, and counter-protesters. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed they are looking into multiple incidents, including reports of violence. They have made 11 arrests connected to the demonstrations, addressing various offences like assault and public disorder. Two of the arrested individuals were later de-arrested, leaving nine in custody. GMP is encouraging anyone with footage from the protests to share it to aid their investigation while emphasising the importance of public safety and the right to protest peacefully.
