Leigh Sports Village stadium, home to the Leigh Leopards and Manchester United women's team, is now officially renamed the Progress With Unity Stadium, following a council meeting approval. This change comes alongside the news that local band The Lottery Winners will headline a gig there in 2026. Council leader David Molyneux emphasised the name reflects community strength and partnership. He believes it captures the stadium's role as a hub of both professional and grassroots sports, highlighting shared values in Leigh. The stadium, which opened in 2008 with a capacity of 12,000, has been a crucial community facility, hosting everything from international rugby league matches to the UEFA Women's Euro 2022. Derek Beaumont, owner of Leigh Leopards, praised the stadium and its strong ties with the community. The venue also includes various athletic and educational facilities, reinforcing its importance to Leigh.
