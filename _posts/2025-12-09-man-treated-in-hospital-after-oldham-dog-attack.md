Police in Oldham are looking into a dog attack that happened on Duchess Street in Shaw on Saturday evening. A man walking his dog was reportedly bitten by what police believe to be a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The man sustained two puncture wounds on his hand and needed hospital treatment, including a tetanus jab. GMP has shared a CCTV image and is keen to speak with the dog's owners, who were dressed in all black and are thought to frequent local businesses. Anyone with information is urged to contact GMP on 101 or via their website’s Live Chat, citing log number CRI/06QQ/0027621/25.
