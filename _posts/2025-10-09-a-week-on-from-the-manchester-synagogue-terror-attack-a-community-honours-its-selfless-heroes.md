A week after a tragic attack, the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation came together to honour two heroes, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, who were killed during the incident. Rabbi Daniel Walker delivered a heartfelt speech, emphasising resilience and community strength against evil. Hundreds attended the vigil, laying flowers and sharing prayers, showing solidarity and support. Many expressed pride in their faith and community, despite the horrors experienced. Michael Goldstone, a witness to the attack, reflected on the trauma but praised the community's defiance and unity. Local leaders stressed the need for political support against hate and the importance of standing together across different faiths. The event, coordinated by the Together Coalition, highlighted the deep sense of togetherness, with representatives from various backgrounds showing their support. The Rabbi's message of 'light pushing away darkness' resonated strongly, reminding all present of the strength found in unity during such difficult times.
