Lewis Rimmer, a 41-year-old dad, has been in hospital for ten weeks following a serious accident outside Sainsbury's in Bromley Cross. On October 27, he was struck by a Range Rover while buying a lottery ticket, suffering severe injuries that required seven major surgeries and extensive treatment in ICU. His partner, Sarah, has been sharing updates on his recovery journey, expressing gratitude for the support they’ve received. A fundraiser for Lewis has raised over £111,000 to aid his recovery, as both he and Sarah will be unable to work for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses or any CCTV footage related to the incident. Sarah has highlighted the support from the community during this tough time, thanking everyone for their kindness.
