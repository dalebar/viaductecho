Greater Manchester Police have charged Syed Rafay Ahmad, a 44-year-old from Lulworth Gardens, Wythenshawe, with murder following the tragic death of Anam Rafay, a woman in her 30s. Emergency services arrived around 8.30am on January 27 after reports of a disturbance, and sadly, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Ahmad was arrested on suspicion of murder and is now remanded in custody. He’s due to appear at Stockport Magistrates’ Court on January 28. An inquest into Ms Rafay's death will open later, as confirmed by Manchester Coroners' Court.
