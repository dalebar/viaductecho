Three teenagers, aged 18 to 19, and a taxi driver in his 50s have been named locally following a fatal head-on crash in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The teenagers—Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, Farhan Patel, and Muhammad Danyaal Asghar Ali—were in a red Seat Leon that collided with a Citroen C4 Picasso taxi driven by Mosrab Ali. The incident occurred on Wigan Road early Sunday morning. The Bolton Council of Mosques is supporting the victims' families during this difficult time. Five other passengers were taken to hospital, while local witnesses described the crash as a loud bang with considerable debris scattered across the road. Fire crews had to use cutting equipment to rescue trapped individuals from the vehicles and were on-site for about two hours. Greater Manchester Police are seeking witnesses to assist with their investigation, and local councillors expressed deep sadness over this tragic event, urging that authorities be allowed to conduct their inquiries.
