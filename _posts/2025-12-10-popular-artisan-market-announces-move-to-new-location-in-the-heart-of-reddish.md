Worker Bee Markets is relocating its monthly market in Reddish to The Houldsworth Arms, kicking off on 28 March 2026. Previously at Broadstone Mill Shopping Outlet, organiser Clare Simpson is excited about this new chapter for the markets. Expect over 50 local traders and makers offering a mix of homeware and street food at reasonable prices. Clare emphasised their commitment to the community, noting that many traders are from Reddish, The Heatons, and Denton, and that they provide free stalls for local charities and groups. Worker Bee is also known for hosting various markets across the borough. Keep an eye on their website for upcoming events.
