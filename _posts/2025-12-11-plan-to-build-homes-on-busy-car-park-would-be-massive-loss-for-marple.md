Residents of Marple are concerned about plans to demolish a busy car park on Chadwick Street to make way for new homes, suggesting it would be a significant loss for the town. The Stockport council's draft local plan aims to add at least 174 new homes in the area, part of a broader goal to build 25,000 homes across the borough by 2042. Locals believe losing the car park would hinder businesses, especially during peak times like Christmas. Business owners have expressed worry over limited parking, as many customers already find it hard to park in the town. While some see potential for increased foot traffic from new housing, the general sentiment leans against sacrificing parking. The council is urging community feedback on the plan, with consultations open until December 21, as they acknowledge the car park's importance to local traders and residents alike.
