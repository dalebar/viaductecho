  Manchester's Christmas markets are making a comeback to Albert Square for the first time since 2019! They'll be open from 7 November to 4 January 2026. Councillor Pat Karney announced that the square is being prepped for a festive celebration, including a massive 50m Ferris wheel and fun rides for kids. 

Due to restoration work on the historic Town Hall, the markets had to relocate in previous years, but the efforts to accelerate the restoration have created the opportunity to bring them back. Along with Albert Square, the markets will pop up at 10 other locations around the city. Karney emphasised the importance of keeping the prices affordable for traders and visitors alike. Itâ€™s set to be a special holiday season in Manchester!
