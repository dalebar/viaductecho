Police cordoned off Richmond and Princess Streets in Manchester’s Gay Village after a shooting incident in the early hours of Saturday, January 24. Officers arrived around 5am following reports of a disturbance and found a man in his 20s with a gunshot wound to his leg, which is non-life-threatening. Six men, aged between 23 and 26, have been arrested on suspicion of affray and firearms offences. The police confirmed that a firearm was recovered from the scene and assured the public that this was not a hate crime targeting the LGBTQ+ community. The area has since reopened, but a police presence remains. Investigations are ongoing, with appeals for witnesses to come forward. Community leaders have emphasised that the incident does not reflect the safety of the Gay Village, which remains a welcoming space for all.
