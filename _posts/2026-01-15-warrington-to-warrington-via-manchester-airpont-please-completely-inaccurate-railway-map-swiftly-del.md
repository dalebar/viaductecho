The London Underground map is renowned for its clarity and longevity, but a recent attempt to showcase Northern Powerhouse Rail plans by West Yorkshire's Mayor Tracy Brabin fell flat and was quickly taken down. The map, which aimed to detail a new Liverpool-Manchester line and revamps to key stations, was riddled with inaccuracies. For instance, it mistakenly placed Manchester Piccadilly about 40 miles too far east, confused Bradford with Huddersfield, and bizarrely featured Warrington three times. It also showed two fictitious Manchester Airports. Despite these hiccups, the actual project, set to enhance rail connections in the north, is progressing in three phases. The initial phase focuses on upgrading existing links, followed by new routes and improved services for cities like Newcastle and Hull. Brabin's original post highlighted government commitments to these upgrades, but user reactions swiftly pointed out the map's errors. The misinformation was corrected with a proper map, leaving behind a mix of bemusement and anticipation for the planned improvements.
