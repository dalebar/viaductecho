High Peak Comps is running some exciting prize draws, offering chances to win big! You can snag £10,000 for just 15p, and there's also the chance to win a coveted Rolex GMT Master II Sprite watch, or £11,000 cash, with tickets starting at 25p. The £10,000 draw closes on 20 February, and the Rolex draw ends on 22 February, with winners announced on their Facebook page.

Beyond the prizes, High Peak Comps is involved in the community, recently donating £50 to support Stockport superstar Aria's charity run, Easter eggs for a local school event, and air fryers for fundraising raffles. They've also contributed substantial amounts to various charities through their community initiatives.

Founded in March 2020, High Peak Comps has given away over £12m and recently won awards for their positive community impact. If you're interested in entering, check out their Facebook page or website for more details and to grab your tickets!
