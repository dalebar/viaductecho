In Whitefield’s Springwater Park, a charred green wheelie bin has sparked concerns as nearby Prestwich residents report stolen bins. This might signal a return of the reckless trend where vandals set bins alight to inhale toxic fumes. Authorities previously warned that this practice is highly dangerous. Meanwhile, in Strangeways, Manchester, vape shops are booming, with 51 new ones appearing on two streets recently, but their popularity may fade soon. Over in Rochdale, George Lythgoe enjoyed the sold-out “Stories We Tell” immersive tour, packed with local history and fun facts. If you fancy a new workout, Dianne Bourne has been trying the Japanese interval walking trend, which involves alternating fast and slow walks, showing promising results. On a weather note, Greater Manchester is in for a wet week ahead, with temperatures expected to drop to 1°C by the weekend. Lastly, roadworks on Barton Dock Road near the Trafford Centre might cause some delays, so keep that in mind!
