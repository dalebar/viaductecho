Manchester's historic town hall is set to reveal its roof for the first time in over three years as a massive restoration project hits a crucial milestone. A giant 300-tonne crane is ready to remove the temporary roof, allowing the iconic structure to be seen again. Since spring 2022, a substantial covering has protected the Grade I-listed building while more than 100,000 roof slates were replaced with handmade replicas from a Cumbrian quarry used in the 1870s. Extensive repairs to chimney stacks and decorative ironwork have also been carried out. The project has included a new LED lighting system for the building's Gothic features and restoration of around 1,200 windows. Councillor Garry Bridges expressed enthusiasm for the progress, highlighting the importance of this heritage building. Despite being Â£76 million over budget, the extensive work is vital for preserving the town hall for future generations. Ultimately, Manchester is excited to welcome back this beloved landmark and its stunning architecture.
