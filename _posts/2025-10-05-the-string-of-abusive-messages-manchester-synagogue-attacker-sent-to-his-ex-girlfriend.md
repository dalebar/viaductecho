A young woman suffered harassment from her ex-partner, Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old who later attacked a synagogue in Manchester. Following their on-off relationship, she described being 'groomed' into adopting his extreme views and faced abusive messages after their split. Al-Shamie, who was shot dead after the attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation on October 2, had previously stalked her and pushed disturbing ideas, including discussing 'rape fantasies' and a desire to join ISIS. The woman shared her ordeal with the Manchester Evening News, revealing that she felt controlled by him, even receiving unsolicited dieting advice. Despite deleting most memories of their time together, she still possesses some distressing messages from him. Sheâ€™s since left the country, reflecting on the psychological manipulation she endured, commenting on how she can't believe she stayed in the relationship for as long as she did.
