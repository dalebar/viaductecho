Stockport council's finances are in a bit of a pickle, facing a £75m funding gap over the next five years, which has led to concerns about the future. This year alone, they've had to scrape together £20m just to balance their £356m budget. The council leaders are quite miffed at the government for a 'fairer funding' review that's made things worse, feeling underfunded compared to others. Despite expecting a £26m increase by 2028/29, they reckon it's not enough. 

To tackle the situation, they've proposed a 4.99% council tax hike, which would add over £100 to annual bills for typical households, alongside a review of parking charges that could see costs rise. While some residents are worried these increases could scare people away from the town, the council aims to save £500,000 from parking fees. There’s also talk of making efficiency savings which might affect staff. Sadly, despite their lobbying, the council feels like their calls for more support have fallen on deaf ears in Westminster. They'll be voting on budget plans soon, but the future looks a tad challenging.
