A campaign led by northern mayors is pushing for the UK to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the north, aiming to address the north-south divide. They argue that cities like Liverpool and Manchester provide a "compelling proposition" to drive regeneration and change how the world perceives England. In a letter to Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, they urged the government to support future bids from the north, emphasising the need for a fair distribution of major events across the country. The leaders point to the north's history of hosting global events and suggest that much of the required infrastructure is already in place. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham highlighted that past events have significantly transformed the region and that an Olympic Games could catalyse even greater long-term investment. The campaigners also seek to collaborate with the government on setting legacy goals for the Games to ensure lasting benefits for northern communities. Support for the initiative includes notable figures like Olympic medallist Luke Campbell and Great North Run founder Sir Brendan Foster.
