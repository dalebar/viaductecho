Emotional scenes unfolded at a vigil in Heaton Park this afternoon to honour the victims of a tragic synagogue attack that claimed the lives of Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz. Rabbi Daniel Walker led the gathering, paying tribute to the victims and thanking the heroes who prevented further harm during the attack. Mark Adlestone from the Jewish Representative Council emphasised the need for broader community support and the importance of standing against hate, urging politicians to promote real integration. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy expressed solidarity with the Jewish community and called for unity against terrorism. Manchester City Council leader Bev Craig and Mayor Andy Burnham echoed these sentiments, stressing that attacks on any community affect everyone. They committed to listening and taking action to foster inclusivity. Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson reassured the community of their commitment to safety, while Bishop of Manchester David Walker highlighted the common humanity that connects all. The vigil was a poignant reminder of resilience and community strength in the face of darkness.
