Salford council is set to approve four house share applications, despite local opposition. The plans, including a nine-bedroom house on East Lancashire Road, have drawn 26 objection letters, raising concerns about noise, dust, and lack of parking. Councillor Gina Reynolds highlighted that noise from the new HMO could disrupt nearby businesses, particularly 'Shiny Bones Tattoo Studio', which needs a calm environment. While residents fear increased crime and anti-social behaviour, council officers argue there's no evidence supporting these claims and cite the area's good transport links. Other HMOs facing objections include properties in Eccles and Shiel Street.
