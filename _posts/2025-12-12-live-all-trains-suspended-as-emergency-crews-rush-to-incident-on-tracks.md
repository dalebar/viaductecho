Train services between Wilmslow and Crewe are currently suspended due to an ongoing incident on the tracks, with emergency services on the scene. Avanti West Coast services, along with Northern and Transport for Wales, are affected. All lines remain closed as of 11pm, and disruptions are expected to continue until the end of the day, with trains potentially cancelled or delayed by up to 60 minutes. Additionally, services are being diverted to Stoke-on-Trent, meaning Wilmslow won't be served. No specifics about the incident have been confirmed, but updates will be provided as they come in. Apologies to commuters affected by this situation!
