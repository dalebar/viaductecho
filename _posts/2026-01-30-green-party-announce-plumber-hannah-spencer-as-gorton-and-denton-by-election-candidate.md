The Green Party has named Hannah Spencer as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election. A plumber and current Trafford councillor, Spencer, 34, has lived in Greater Manchester her whole life. She previously ran in the 2024 Greater Manchester mayoral election, finishing fifth. Spencer emphasised the importance of the by-election, presenting it as a choice between hope with the Greens and division with Reform. She noted Labour's declining support and claimed they’ve abandoned local voters amidst the cost-of-living crisis. Spencer aims to connect with the community, promising to advocate for better wages and investment while holding the government accountable. Green Party leader Zack Polanski expressed confidence in her ability to serve the constituency effectively, adding that now's the time to rally against Reform and foster a sense of hope.
