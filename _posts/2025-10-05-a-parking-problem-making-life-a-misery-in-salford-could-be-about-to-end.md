Salford council is tackling 'indiscriminate visitor parking' in the city centre, particularly around Greengate West and nearby streets. New double yellow lines will be installed to address issues like pavement parking that hinder access for residents and vehicles, especially problematic for emergency services. Locals have voiced frustrations over blocked access, with some saying it’s been a nuisance for years, affecting bin collections and ambulance routes. Resident Stephen McIntosh highlighted the danger for disabled individuals needing timely medical help. The council’s decision on these new restrictions will be made on October 8, with some residents in favour, citing them as 'long overdue.' However, a few objections have been raised regarding potential parking displacement to other nearby streets.
