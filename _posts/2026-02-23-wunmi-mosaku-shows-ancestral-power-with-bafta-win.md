Wunmi Mosaku, a Bafta-winning actress born in Nigeria and raised in Manchester, shared how winning the Best Supporting Actress award for her role in the film *Sinners* helped her rediscover parts of herself she felt she had lost as an immigrant. At 39, she's the first black British winner in this category and has garnered praise for her portrayal of Annie, a Hoodoo priestess. Mosaku expressed the joy of seeing her experiences represented authentically and the connection she felt with other black women who resonated with her journey. Reflecting on her past, Mosaku noted the difficulties growing up in a city where she witnessed the impact of gang violence, relating it to her role in the BBC drama *Damilola, Our Loved Boy*. Surprised by her win, especially while pregnant, she acknowledged her daughter as her greatest teacher. Inspired by the film *Annie*, she pursued acting after discovering drama schools, and her time in the Manchester Girls Choir remains one of her fondest memories.
