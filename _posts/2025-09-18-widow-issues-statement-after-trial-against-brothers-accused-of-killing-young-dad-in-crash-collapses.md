The widow of Rhys Jenkins, a 41-year-old dad who died in a car crash while his son Ioan was seriously injured, has shared her heartbreak after a trial against two brothers, Abubakr and Umar Ben Yusaf, collapsed. The brothers, from Manchester, were accused of causing the fatal crash while allegedly racing home. The court discharged the jury due to legal reasons on the eighth day of the trial. Carrie Jenkins, Rhys's widow, is focused on supporting her children and has expressed gratitude for the support from family and friends during this tough time. A new trial date has been set for June 1, 2026.
