Rochdale Council is warning residents about a man selling mattresses to elderly folks, potentially putting them at risk. These mattresses might not meet fire safety standards, and the seller doesnâ€™t provide receipts or contact details, leaving customers in a tough spot if issues arise. Residents are urged to keep an eye on vulnerable neighbours and friends to prevent them from getting stuck with dodgy goods. The council's spokesperson advised caution with bargain-priced items offered on the doorstep. If anyone encounters such sellers, they should report them to trading standards or the police. Stay vigilant out there!
