A recent investigation revealed poor lookout arrangements on the boat that tragically killed 70-year-old diver Paul Smith from Greater Manchester. He was diving near the wreck of the SMS Markgraf in Scapa Flow when he was struck by the propeller of the support vessel, Karin, on September 28, 2023. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) report highlighted that the lookout duties on Karin were not followed properly, as the deckhand was not stationed at the bow, leading to the possibility of divers being unnoticed. Smith was ascending from the wreck when his delayed surface marker buoy was not seen by Karin’s crew, despite being visible to another boat, Jean Elaine. The MAIB noted a previous incident involving a diver from Karin, stressing ongoing safety concerns. Following the findings, the Karin’s owner has sold the boat, and the MAIB has urged local authorities to assess dive boat operations around Orkney for improved safety measures.
