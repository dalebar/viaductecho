Freda Smith, a 74-year-old pensioner from Salford, is appealing for some peace and quiet due to unbearable noise from roadworks on Liverpool Road. The construction, carried out by ESP Electricity for a new electric vehicle charging station, is causing significant disruption, shaking her whole house and preventing her from napping during the day. Freda, who suffers from severe arthritis, is frustrated as the noise has been continuous since early January. She claims she wasn't given proper notice about the works and has had to turn up her TV to drown out the sound.

Freda's home situation has worsened, affecting her family life, as her ten-year-old grandson hasn't been able to visit. The roadworks have also narrowed the road, raising safety concerns with heavy goods vehicles passing close to her home. While ESP Electricity states they are trying to minimise disruption, Freda feels ignored and just wants some tranquillity in her retirement. Her previous experiences with disruptive noise issues in the area add to her distress.
