Life Leisure is enhancing its Active Hospital initiative, aimed at helping patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport engage in physical activity for better health and wellbeing. Led by Lisa Arrandale and Jan Sinclair, the initiative focuses on making movement feel achievable, not forced. They've introduced Active Hospital kit bags in wards containing items like pedal exercisers, resistance bands, and pedometers to support low-impact movement. The kits also come with easy-to-follow exercise ideas and information about community programmes, including Life Leisure's Active Pathways that guide individuals toward a more active lifestyle post-hospital. Lisa emphasised the goal to keep patients motivated and confident in their recovery. Life Leisure also offers regular Tai Chi and low-impact exercise classes at the hospital, linking hospital activities to community options. Moving forward into 2026, they'll build on their hospital presence, adapting support based on feedback to ensure sustainable movement for all. For more on Active Pathways, check out their website!
