A new housing development is in the works for a 27-acre site on Jacksons Lane in Hazel Grove, Stockport, with plans for up to 160 homes. Taylor Wimpey is proposing a mix of one to five-bedroom houses, with half earmarked as ‘affordable’. The northern part of the site will host the homes while the southern section will remain as open green space, including play areas. This site is currently agricultural land and is designated as green belt, though the developer argues it should be classified as ‘grey belt’ due to its limited contribution to rural openness.

Concerns have been raised by local residents regarding potential impacts on green spaces and increased traffic. Some long-term residents feel strongly about preserving the area for community use. Additionally, a second application from Bellway Homes for 176 new homes nearby raises the prospect of significant development in the neighbourhood. The Stockport council has until April 17, 2026, to decide on Taylor Wimpey’s proposal. Community feedback from the council’s draft local plan consultation is currently under review.
