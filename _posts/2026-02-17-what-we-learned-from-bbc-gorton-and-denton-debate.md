Five candidates are vying for the Gorton and Denton by-election in a debate that highlighted key issues like the economy and immigration. With over 76,000 potential voters in the area, political analysts see a tight race mainly between Labour, Green, and Reform parties. 

Economically, while Manchester has progressed well over the past decade, candidates agree that some areas, including Gorton, are struggling to keep up, with cost of living complaints prominent on the doorstep. Labour’s Angeliki Stogia promoted minimum wage increases to help families, while Conservative Charlotte Cadden criticized Labour's policies for stifling job growth. Green's Hannah Spencer proposed public ownership of energy to reduce living costs, and Reform UK's Matt Goodwin called for tax cuts for small businesses to boost job creation.

Immigration was hotly debated, with Reform and Conservatives raising concerns about illegal immigration, while Labour and Greens accused them of fanning divisive sentiments. Housing shortages were also a key topic, with calls for affordable rentals and concerns over buy-to-let investors affecting local schools. Overall, the debate underscored ongoing local challenges and differing party solutions.
