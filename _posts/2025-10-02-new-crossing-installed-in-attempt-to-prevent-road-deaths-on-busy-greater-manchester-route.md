A new pedestrian crossing has been set up on Howard Street in Rochdale, aimed at preventing future accidents, injuries, and deaths on this busy road. Located outside the Howard Street Nursery and Family Hub, this crossing is part of a broader initiative to achieve zero road fatalities and serious injuries across Greater Manchester by 2040. Since 2018, there have been seven reported accidents in the area, but thankfully no fatalities.

The Howard Street crossing is the latest addition to several safety enhancements in Rochdale over the last year, including other crossings in key locations around the borough. While not all of these are tied to the Vision Zero project, they contribute to improving overall road safety. The local council is keen to make it easier for families to choose healthier travel options, with benefits especially for children. Both local council members and community leaders have expressed their joy at the new crossing, highlighting its importance for the safety and well-being of residents.
