A man, Christopher Smith (41) from Manchester, has been charged with several offences after police responded to reports of him acting aggressively outside the Heaton Park synagogue in Crumpsall on October 20. His charges include two counts of possessing a class B drug, a racially-aggravated public order offence, a public order offence against a staff member, and criminal damage. Smith has been remanded in custody and is set to appear at Tameside Magistrates' Court. This incident occurred soon after a visit from King Charles to the synagogue, following a recent tragic attack there.
