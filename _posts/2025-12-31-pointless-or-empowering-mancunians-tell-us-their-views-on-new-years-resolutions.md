Navigating personal goals in today’s hustle and wellness culture can be tricky, especially with New Year's resolutions. A SuperNutrio Milk survey found that 74% of Mancunians see resolutions as outdated, with many feeling they rarely stick to them. Behavioral psychologist Jo Hemmings suggests aiming for smaller, achievable intentions rather than stress-inducing all-or-nothing goals. 

Manchester locals shared their views: Sam, an interior decorator, believes resolutions just delay self-improvement, recommending consistent efforts instead. Liam, a teacher, tracks his non-drinking days for better health, while Ryan, a DJ, balances work and personal limits on drinking. Elise, an accounts manager, prefers ongoing goals over New Year's prompts. 

Others, like Sangeet and Ross, acknowledged past struggles but expressed hope for the future, with Ros focusing on travel memories rather than pubs. Michael, a rugby player, highlighted the importance of commitment regardless of motivation. Ultimately, Manchester residents exhibit diverse perspectives on resolutions, emphasising personal accountability and ongoing progress over strict January timelines.
