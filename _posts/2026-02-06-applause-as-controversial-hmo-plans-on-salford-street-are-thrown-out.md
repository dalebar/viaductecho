Councillors in Salford voted to reject a house share application for a four-bedroom HMO on Shiel Street, to the joy of local objectors. The planning committee discussed concerns over bedroom size and cycle storage accessibility, which was deemed inconvenient. Deputy Mayor Jack Youd pointed out that tenants would struggle to navigate bikes through the house due to blocked access. He emphasised that the design didn't align with the council's local housing plan guidelines. Although some councillors raised doubts about the compliance of the cycle storage plans, the committee ultimately voted five to four against the proposal, eliciting cheers from the audience. Meanwhile, three other HMO applications received approval in Salford, highlighting the city's ongoing housing shortage, with around 5,000 people currently on the housing register.
