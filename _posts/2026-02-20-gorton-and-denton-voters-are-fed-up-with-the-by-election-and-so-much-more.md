This morning in Haughton Green, villagers braved a biting wind while waiting for a bus, but their frustration wasn't just about the wait—it was mostly aimed at the lengthy campaigning for the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election on February 26. Lucy, 50, and others expressed their weariness over constant political chatter, particularly as three parties vie for the seat: the Greens with Hannah Spencer, Labour's Angeliki Stogia, and Reform UK’s Matt Goodwin, with Reform gaining popularity in the area. Many locals feel disillusioned by the government's lack of vision, reflecting on years of austerity and crisis. The resignation of long-serving MP Andrew Gwynne, amid controversy, has further soured opinions about politics. While some yearn for change, others are sceptical about whether any new MP will significantly improve their situation. Concerns about crime, community spirit, and local decline echo through conversations—many feel disconnected from their once-vibrant community. As polling day approaches, there’s a notable tension and desire for meaningful change among voters, yet a prevailing sense of apathy looms over many, resulting in uncertainty about voter turnout.
