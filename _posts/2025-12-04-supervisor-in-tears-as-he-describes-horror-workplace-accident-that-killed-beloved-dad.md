During an inquest at Rochdale Coroners Court, a supervisor emotionally recounted witnessing the tragic death of Anthony John Paul McLaughlin, a 41-year-old machine operator at Oldham Engineering, on November 29, 2023. Mr McLaughlin, a dedicated worker and Manchester United fan, was killed 'immediately' after entering a hazardous machine. Supervisor Lee Dale described his frantic attempt to press the emergency stop button and called for help as colleagues were left in shock.

The court heard Mr McLaughlin was known as a skilled engineer and was well-liked, with no prior complaints about the machine. Officials stated the machine's interlock system should’ve prevented movement when the door was open, but concerns arose during the hearing about a possible bypass with a 'dummy key'. Mr McLaughlin's partner, Suzanne Joyce, highlighted his struggles with staffing issues at work and his loving family life, including his excitement for his twin sons. The pathologist confirmed Mr McLaughlin's cause of death as blunt force injuries. The inquest is ongoing.
