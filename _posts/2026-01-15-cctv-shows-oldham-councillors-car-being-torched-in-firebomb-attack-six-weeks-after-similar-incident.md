Councillor Josh Charters' car was set on fire in an alleged ‘firebomb’ attack outside his home in Oldham on January 13, just six weeks after a similar incident involving another council candidate. Thankfully, no one was injured, but Charters’ Mini Cooper Sport was completely destroyed. He reported the incident on Facebook, expressing concern but stating he and his fiancée were unharmed. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are investigating, and Charters urged locals to share any video evidence they might have. Witnesses reportedly saw someone throw liquid on the car before igniting it. GMP confirmed they responded to the suspected arson and are collaborating with council officials during the investigation. This incident follows a previous arson attack on council candidate Shah Bahram in December and another on council leader Arooj Shah’s vehicle in 2021, raising concerns about safety in the area.
