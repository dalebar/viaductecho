Bus workers from Stagecoach and Metroline in Greater Manchester are gearing up for strikes on October 10, 11, 13, 18, 23, and 24, affecting over 1,900 workers, as reported by Unite the union. While First Bus employees have reached a resolution with a generous 20% pay rise, causing them to call off their strikes, the ongoing disputes with Stagecoach and Metroline remain unresolved. Passengers have faced significant disruptions, with many resorting to taxis due to halted services. Unite's regional officer expressed satisfaction with the deal at First but warned that further strikes could occur if new, acceptable offers aren't made by the other firms. Meanwhile, Transport for Greater Manchester is encouraging continued negotiations to avert more disruptions. Metroline's spokesperson expressed disappointment at the continuation of the strike actions despite offering an 8.8% pay rise over two years, insisting they value their drivers and seek a resolution. Overall, commuters are advised to stay updated on bus service statuses through official channels to plan their journeys accordingly.
