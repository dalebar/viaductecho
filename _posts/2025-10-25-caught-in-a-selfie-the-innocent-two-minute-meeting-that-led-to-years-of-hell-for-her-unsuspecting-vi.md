Samantha Wall, a Stockport resident, has been sentenced to over two years in prison for a relentless cyberstalking campaign against entrepreneur Brad Burton and businesswoman Naomi Timperley. Wall's false accusations included claims of animal cruelty, affairs, and even serious criminal behaviour, severely damaging both victims' reputations and mental health. Over four years, her lies transformed their lives into a nightmare, causing financial strain and emotional distress. Burton described her actions as a "modern-day witch hunt" that led to the collapse of his professional network and insolvency of his business. Timperley recounted the overwhelming fear and anxiety she faced due to Wall's online harassment. Both spoke about the toll the situation took on their mental well-being, necessitating prescribed medication. Following a lengthy legal battle, Wall changed her plea just before her trial began and was jailed at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court. Both victims expressed hope that Wall's conviction would bring closure, while also calling for social media companies to take responsibility in preventing such harassment and safeguarding users' rights. The Greater Manchester Police also underscored their commitment to tackling online abuse.
