The M60 motorway was closed for several hours today, January 8, due to a welfare concern in Stockport. All lanes of the anti-clockwise carriageway between junctions 1 and 27 were shut from about 1:30pm, affecting the A6/Wellington Road North as well. Emergency services attended to a member of the public, causing over four miles of traffic delays, with congestion stretching back to junctions 2 and 3. The roads reopened just before 4pm after the situation was safely resolved. Both Greater Manchester Police and Fire and Rescue confirmed their presence at the scene, and a local praised the quick response from the emergency services on Facebook.
