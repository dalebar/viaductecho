Reddish Vale Country Park, affectionately known as 'the Vale', spans 400 acres filled with meadows, woodlands, and the historic Harrison’s Weir from 1791. The River Tame flows through the park, marking the boundary of Lancashire and Cheshire before joining the Mersey. Notable structures include a 16-arch railway viaduct from 1875, cloaked in local folklore, and the iconic Bogie Line, which connected the area to Denton Colliery until its closure in 1929. 

The print works down Reddish Vale Road, opened in 1780, evolved over the years and employed many locals, including the progressive Lydia Becker. Although production ceased in 1975, remnants of the industrial past linger, like Tame House, now a private residence. 

Today, Reddish Vale is a nature haven with diverse wildlife, accessible parking, and a popular café. The local heritage trust offers insights into the area's rich history, with various public events held monthly. Overall, the Vale stands resilient, celebrating its natural and industrial legacy.
