A pro-Palestine rally took place in Manchester city centre today, following a terrorist attack at a Crumpsall synagogue. Despite the rain and recent events, around 100 supporters gathered outside Manchester Cathedral before marching. Speakers addressed the crowd, discussing the Gaza conflict and asking attendees to avoid media engagement. Counter-protesters appeared, leading to police intervention to separate the groups. Pro-Palestine marches have been ongoing in Manchester, but today's turnout was smaller, likely due to the recent violence and calls for postponement from prominent figures, including the Prime Minister, who urged respect for the grief of Jewish communities. Meanwhile, a protest against the proscription of Palestine Action is still set to happen in London, with the police making arrests for placard displays in support of the organisation. Greater Manchester Police have increased security around Jewish sites in light of the attack. Sir Stephen Watson, the Chief Constable, encouraged people to reconsider attending protests during this sensitive time.
