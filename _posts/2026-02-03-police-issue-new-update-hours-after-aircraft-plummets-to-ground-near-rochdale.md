Police provided an update after a light aircraft crashed near Rochdale on February 3. Emergency services, including GMP officers, ambulances, and firefighters, responded to the incident on moorland near Blackstone Edge and Hollingworth Lake. Two people were believed to be onboard, and one reportedly used a parachute to evacuate, with a yellow parachute spotted attached to a pylon nearby. The aircraft had taken off from Birmingham Airport at around 10 am before the crash occurred roughly 40 minutes later. While it’s still unclear if there are any casualties, a major scene is established, and local roads are closed. GMP is collaborating with the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) to uncover the cause of the crash, and witnesses are being asked to reach out. Chief Superintendent Danny Inglis urged the public to avoid the area as investigations continue. The AAIB confirmed that a team of inspectors is on-site and has initiated an investigation. Those with information can contact police via 101 or the GMP website.
