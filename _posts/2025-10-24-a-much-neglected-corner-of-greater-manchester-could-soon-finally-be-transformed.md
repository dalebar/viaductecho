Oldham is set to see over a hundred new 'affordable' homes built on a former railway site, left vacant for years. Developers Vestry Group and First Choice Homes Oldham plan 147 homesâ€”90 for social rent, 40 for shared ownership, and 9 for rent-to-buy. The development will include 50 houses and 97 apartments, connected by a new road linking A62 Oldham Way to Southlink, all nestled in greenery and designed to be energy-efficient. Mark Gifford OBE from First Choice Homes excitedly noted this as their biggest project yet, aimed at providing affordable family homes. The land, once owned by Oldham Borough Council and Transport for Greater Manchester, was sold last year to encourage development in the neglected area. Notably, this project is set to be one of the first 100% low-carbon affordable housing schemes in Greater Manchester, with support from Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Homes England. The planning application has faced no objections so far, marking a positive step for the community.
