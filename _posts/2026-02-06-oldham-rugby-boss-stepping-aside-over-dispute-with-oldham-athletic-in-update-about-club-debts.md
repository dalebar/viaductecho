Bill Quinn, chair of Oldham’s rugby club, is stepping aside amid a dispute with Oldham Athletic following a series of allegations that are described as ‘totally unfounded’ by the rugby boss. His move, announced via a Facebook video, comes after a Roughyed's boss was banned from Boundary Park for a year related to a financial spat between the two clubs. Quinn will concentrate on a legal battle against Athletic’s directors while allowing the rugby club to refocus on their goals. He indicated there are money disputes on both sides but emphasised they won't be coerced into settling debts. Oldham Athletic has remained silent on the issue but stated they will engage constructively with the rugby club. This shake-up follows the sudden departure of director Mike Ford, highlighting instability within the club. Additionally, Oldham RLFC recently faced financial troubles linked to a winding-up order from HMRC, which Quinn claims has now been resolved. They’re actively working to clear debts and ensure all creditors are paid properly.
