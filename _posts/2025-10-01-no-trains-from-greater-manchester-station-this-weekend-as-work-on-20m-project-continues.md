This weekend, Stockport station in Greater Manchester won’t be running any trains due to ongoing work on the Greek Street Bridge. From Saturday, October 4, to Sunday, October 5, all services will be suspended. Passengers can use Metrolink services between Altrincham/Navigation Road and Manchester city centre or catch replacement buses on routes 11, 42C, 192, 368, 370, and 378, as train tickets are valid on these. The project, which started in March and aims to finish by Spring 2026, is currently focusing on work under the recently installed bridge. It's a crucial interchange for Stockport town centre, Shaw Heath, and Edgeley. The next round of work is set for late December. The new bridge consists of 51 parts, including concrete cills, steel and concrete beams, and parapet walls designed to match the old bridge's colour.
