The Asian food market, EatGoodWest, in Stockport has been rescheduled to Friday 10th and Saturday 11th October due to poor weather this weekend, including chilly temperatures and strong winds from Storm Amy. The event will now kick off at St Mary's Church on Friday from 5-10pm and move to the Merseyway Centre on Saturday from 9am to 5pm. Attendees can enjoy the Moon Festival with a variety of attractions like delicious Asian food, lantern painting, workshops, live music, and a giant moon installation for photos. Plus, entry is free!
