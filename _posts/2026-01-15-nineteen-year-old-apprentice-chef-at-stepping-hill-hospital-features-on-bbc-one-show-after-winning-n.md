Nineteen-year-old Joe Omolo, a talented apprentice chef from Stepping Hill Hospital, wowed viewers on BBC One's Morning Live after being crowned NHS Chef of the Year at a national competition. In just two weeks as an apprentice, Joe showcased his culinary skills alongside teammate Nedko Rusev by preparing a delicious menu that included saganaki, cauliflower steak with romesco sauce, hake with cauliflower sauce, and fig cake. Joe credits his passion for cooking to his mum, who runs a pop-up kitchen, and admits he still had more to learn. This competition marked a historic moment, as it was the first time two NHS trusts teamed up after both original partners had to pull out. Joe had previously competed with Ian Richards from the Stockport NHS catering team, reaching the finals together. You can catch Joe's segment on BBC iPlayer, starting around 40 minutes in.
