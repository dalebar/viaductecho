Snow and ice are on the way for North West England, with the Met Office issuing yellow weather warnings for various Greater Manchester boroughs. This follows amber cold weather health alerts from the UK Health Security Agency, which apply across England until January 6. The yellow warnings cover areas including Manchester, Trafford, Stockport, Salford, Tameside, Oldham, Bury, and Bolton, with only Wigan and Rochdale spared. The Met Office predicts sleet and snow moving southeast, lasting a few hours in each spot, with potential snow accumulations of 1-5 cm, especially on higher ground. Icy conditions are expected as well, particularly where precipitation falls on frozen surfaces. Stay warm and be cautious out there!
