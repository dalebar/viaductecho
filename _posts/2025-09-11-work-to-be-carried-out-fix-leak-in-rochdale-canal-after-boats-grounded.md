Residents at New Islington marina have been stuck due to a leak in the Rochdale Canal, which has caused water levels to drop significantly. The Canal & River Trust (CRT) discovered the leak after boaters identified a breach on Butler Street. With boats unable to move, residents are concerned about potential damage to their homes. Dave Marshall, a long-term marina resident, highlighted the difficulties, including needing to buy bottled water and being unable to empty toilets. CRT has committed to a temporary repair and announced plans for further work, including replacing nearby lock gates this winter. They acknowledged the impact of the recent drought on water levels and are working to manage supply. The situation underscores the ongoing challenges faced by the UK's aging canal network.
