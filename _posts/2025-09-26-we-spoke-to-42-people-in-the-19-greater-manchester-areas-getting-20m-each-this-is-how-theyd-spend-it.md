In late August, groups in Greater Manchester initiated ‘Operation Raise The Colours’, attaching flags to street furniture. While some viewed this as harmless patriotism, others flagged concerns about links to far-right groups like Britain First. The government is now supporting these areas with the 'Pride in Place' programme, allocating £20m over a decade to improve local communities. The scheme allows residents to decide where to spend the funds, aiming to revitalise towns and tackle issues like boarded shops and neglected spaces. Feedback from locals highlighted a desire for community hubs, more activities for youth, and diverse shops to encourage socialising. Suggestions included new facilities in Wythenshawe and Platt Bridge, safer play areas in Breightmet, and vibrant shopping options in Radcliffe and Monsall. However, some residents expressed skepticism about whether the funding would lead to lasting change, with concerns that past efforts had not delivered. Many believe it falls on the community to actively participate and make the most of the investment to restore their neighbourhoods' heart and soul.
