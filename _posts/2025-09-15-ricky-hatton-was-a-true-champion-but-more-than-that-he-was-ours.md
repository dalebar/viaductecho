Ricky Hatton was a powerhouse in the boxing ring, known for his explosive style and trademark left hook. He was relentless, often finishing fights early but also capable of going the distance. While his scrappy approach might not have wowed purists, it mirrored his working-class roots—what you saw is what you got. His defence wasn’t the best, and he took his share of hits, especially from faster boxers, yet he faced it all with bravery. Outside the ring, Hatton’s honesty about his struggles with mental health and addiction made him relatable and beloved, especially in Manchester. He was genuine in a world of polished athletes, connecting with fans by openly acknowledging his flaws. Proud of his Hattersley upbringing, he remained tied to his roots even after finding fame. The outpouring of love after his passing reflects how much he meant to people—flawed, funny, and full of heart, Hatton was more than a champion; he was one of us.
