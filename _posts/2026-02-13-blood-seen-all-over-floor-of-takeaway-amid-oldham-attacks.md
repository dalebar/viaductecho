There’s been a spate of serious stabbings in Oldham, with a witness describing blood everywhere at a chicken shop where a man sought help after being attacked on Featherstall Road North around 7.30pm. He’s now in stable condition in hospital. Earlier, another 21-year-old was attacked in the B&M car park nearby, sustaining leg and head injuries but they’re not deemed life-threatening. A 21-year-old man has been arrested in connection with these incidents, while police investigate two vehicles found at the scene. Earlier in the evening, a third attack left a 26-year-old man with potentially life-changing injuries in Butler Green, and no arrests have been made for that incident yet. Authorities have implemented a section 60 order, allowing more stop-and-search measures in the area. Detectives are probing whether these attacks are linked, emphasising that knife crime won’t be tolerated in Greater Manchester. They’re urging anyone with information to come forward.
