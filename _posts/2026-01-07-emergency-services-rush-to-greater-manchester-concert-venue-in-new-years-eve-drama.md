A Good Samaritan, a coronary nurse in the audience, was praised for her quick response when a woman collapsed from a cardiac arrest at the New Year's Eve show, "Love is in the Air," at The Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. The show, featuring West End singer Miranda Wilford, stopped for an hour as the nurse provided CPR until paramedics arrived after being alerted at 8:11 PM. The woman in her 60s was then taken to hospital. A spokesperson for the venue confirmed that emergency services were called and offered no further comment due to the medical nature of the situation. The witness noted that the nurse likely saved the woman's life.
