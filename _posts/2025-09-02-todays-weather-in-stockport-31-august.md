Today's weather in Stockport is looking quite balanced, with a mix of sunshine and clouds. Temperatures will range from a comfy 13°C to a pleasant 20°C, and while the humidity sits at 73%, it shouldn't be too bothersome. There's a 32% chance of light showers, but if they happen, they're expected to be brief, so don’t fret too much about it. Winds might hit 25 mph, which could make things feel a bit brisk, especially during your commute.

If you're heading out, it might be a good idea to take a light rain jacket or an umbrella just in case. With the combination of mild temps and a fresh breeze, it's a great day for outdoor activities, just keep your plans flexible for those brief shower interruptions. Overall, it’s a lovely day to enjoy a stroll in the park or check out local spots without lugging around the heavy coat. Cheers to a decent day ahead!
