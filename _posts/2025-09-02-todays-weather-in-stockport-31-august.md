Today in Stockport, expect a lovely mix of sunshine and clouds, with temperatures swinging from 13°C up to a comfy 20°C. Humidity is sitting at 73%, and there's a 32% chance of light showers, so it might be worth grabbing a light jacket or umbrella just in case. Winds could reach 25 mph, making it feel a bit brisk, especially if you’re out and about. 

With the weather being mostly pleasant, it's a great day to get outside, whether that's a stroll in the park or hitting up local spots. Just keep an eye on the sky and be ready to adjust your plans if a shower rolls in. Happy adventuring!
