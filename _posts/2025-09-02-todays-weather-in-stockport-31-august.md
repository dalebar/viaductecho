Today's weather in Stockport is looking pretty decent, with a mix of sun and clouds throughout the day. Temperatures will range from a comfy 13°C in the morning up to a nice 20°C later on. Humidity is at a moderate 73%, so it shouldn't feel sticky. There’s a 32% chance of a light shower, but if it does rain, expect it to be brief. Winds could be a bit brisk at 25 mph, so it might feel a tad chillier—especially if you're commuting. It’s a good idea to pack a light rain jacket or an umbrella just in case. Overall, it’s a great day for outdoor plans; just keep your options flexible in case of those pesky showers. Perfect for a stroll in the park or checking out local spots without the heavy heat. Enjoy!
