Lucy Powell has expressed her excitement at being elected as the Labour Partyâ€™s Deputy Leader, following her victory over Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson with 54% of the votes. The election was held after Angela Rayner resigned due to a tax scandal, and Powell received 87,407 votes amid a low turnout of just 16.6%. In her acceptance speech, she highlighted the need for Labour to embrace change and emphasised the party's values. Powell acknowledged the challenges facing the country and pledged to be a champion for Labour's core beliefs, referencing her Manchester roots and the achievements of past Labour governments. She called for unity and active listening within the party to ensure voices are heard and to build a broader, more progressive consensus ahead of key elections next year. Powell positioned herself as an ally to leader Keir Starmer in the fight for change, stressing the importance of addressing deep-seated inequalities and reuniting the party and its voter coalition.
