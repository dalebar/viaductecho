A project has kicked off to enhance safety at the busy junction of Plodder Lane and Redgate Way, crucial for those heading to Royal Bolton Hospital and Cherry Tree primary school. The improvements, undertaken by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), will see new signalled crossings and wider pavements installed, aimed at helping pedestrians, cyclists, and those with disabilities. Work commenced on September 15 and is expected to last around 10 weeks, with temporary traffic lights causing some disruption. TfGM is ensuring ambulances will have priority during emergencies. Active travel commissioner Dame Sarah Storey noted the importance of safe crossings, especially for non-car users, while Bolton council’s highways executive, Coun Hamid Khurram, emphasised the need for easy access to vital services. This project is part of a broader £3.8m initiative for junction improvements across Greater Manchester, which has seen an increase in short walking trips over the past five years.
