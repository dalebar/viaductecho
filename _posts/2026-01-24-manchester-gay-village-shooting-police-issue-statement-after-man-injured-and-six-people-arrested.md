Six arrests have been made after a man was shot in the leg in Manchester's Gay Village early Saturday morning. Officers responded to reports of a disturbance on Richmond Street, finding the man with a non-life-threatening injury. A firearm was discovered at the scene, prompting police to investigate the incident as 'targeted'. The arrested individuals, aged 23 to 26, are being held on suspicion of affray and firearms offences. The area is cordoned off while forensic teams gather evidence. Superintendent Stephen Wiggins reassured the public that there is no wider threat and highlighted the ongoing efforts to combat gun crime in Greater Manchester. Police are calling for witnesses or anyone with relevant information to come forward.
