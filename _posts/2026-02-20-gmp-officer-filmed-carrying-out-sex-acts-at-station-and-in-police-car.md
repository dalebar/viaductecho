A former GMP officer, PC Usman Ahmed, was found guilty of gross misconduct after video footage revealed he engaged in sexual acts while on duty, both in a police vehicle and at a force station. Despite the serious allegations, he resigned before his misconduct hearing on February 6, 2026, without acknowledging the claims against him. Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson reviewed evidence showing multiple breaches of professional standards and described Ahmed's actions as deliberate and significant enough to bring disgrace to the police force. Sir Stephen noted a troubling pattern of misconduct among officers and expressed concern over public trust, stating Ahmed’s behaviour was wholly unacceptable. He added that Ahmed showed no remorse or engagement with the process, highlighting a severe lack of professionalism. Had he not resigned, Ahmed would have faced immediate dismissal and his name has been added to the College of Policing's Barred List.
