A lightning strike near Rochdale has knocked out a train signalling system, leading to delays for commuters. National Rail anticipates disruptions into rush hour on Thursday, affecting multiple Northern routes, including services between Chester and Leeds, and Manchester Victoria and Leeds. The lightning hit during heavy rain and storms in the area, specifically impacting trains at Castleton station. National Rail confirmed that trains might face cancellations, delays of up to 30 minutes, or route changes. Engineers are on-site working to fix the signalling issues, but trains will be running at a reduced speed. Northern services may only operate between Manchester Victoria and Rochdale, while TransPennine Express won't stop at Castleton. Buses are set to run between Brighouse and Manchester Victoria, stopping at Castleton. Disruptions are expected to last until around 4pm.
