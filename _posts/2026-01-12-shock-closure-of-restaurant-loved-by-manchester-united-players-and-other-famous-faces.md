After more than 40 years, Puccini restaurant in Swinton is closing its doors for good. Opened in 1982 and run by Michele Pucci since 1990, the Italian eatery has faced a steep decline in trade, staff shortages, and rising costs, worsened by the pandemic and Brexit. Michele expresses his sadness at the decision, highlighting how the area has changed, with fewer regulars and challenges attracting younger customers. Although he’s grateful for loyal patrons, it’s just not viable anymore. Famous for hosting sports stars like the England football team and the likes of Gary Neville and Sylvester Stallone, the restaurant has been a local institution. Despite recent council discussions on Swinton’s regeneration, Michele feels unsupported, stating that efforts to maintain the restaurant are affecting his health. Around 15 staff members will be impacted by the closure. He hopes for a brighter future for Swinton but acknowledges that the current situation simply can’t continue.
