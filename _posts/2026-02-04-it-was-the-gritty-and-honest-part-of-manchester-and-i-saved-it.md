Sir Stephen Watson reflects on his journey from a kitchen salesman in Cheetham Hill to being knighted as Greater Manchester’s Chief Constable. When he returned in 2021, he was shocked to find Cheetham Hill transformed from a gritty area of factories to a haven for serious crime. Through Operation Vulcan, he led efforts to dismantle "Counterfeit Street," resulting in the seizure of over 1,000 tonnes of fake goods and the closure of 216 shops. His tenure has seen Greater Manchester Police rise from special measures to a highly regarded force, with a strong focus on neighbourhood policing. 

He critiques policies like the recording of Non-Crime Hate Incidents and the rise of self-styled auditors at protests, suggesting they distort public perception and undermine policing. Watson expresses pride in revitalising GMP, emphasising a stronger community presence with increased officers in neighbourhood roles. Despite speculation about future roles, he remains committed to Manchester, calling it a privilege to serve in his current position and proud of the progress made in the city.
