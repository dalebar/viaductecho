This weekend’s EFL matches could really shape the season. After Chris Wilder was sacked by Sheffield United, he's back in charge, looking to turn things around. Coventry City has struggled in past visits to the King Power Stadium. Newcomers Cardiff and Bradford are making their mark in League One. There’s a bit of a backstory with Bolton's Steven Schumacher and Wigan's Ryan Lowe, who previously played and worked together at Bury and Plymouth. In League Two, Gillingham may not be at the top, but they’re in great form. For all the action, you can catch live updates on the BBC Sport website and app, kicking off with Middlesbrough vs. West Bromwich Albion on Friday.
