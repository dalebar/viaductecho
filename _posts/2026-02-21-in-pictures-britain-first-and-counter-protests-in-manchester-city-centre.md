Hundreds gathered in Manchester city centre today for a march organised by the far-right group Britain First, starting outside Piccadilly station. The event, focused on "remigration and mass deportations," saw participants waving large England flags. Tensions flared as clashes broke out between some protestors and police, leading to at least three arrests, particularly in Piccadilly Gardens.

In response, Greater Manchester Police imposed a 10-hour dispersal order to manage the situation and prevent anti-social behaviour. Meanwhile, counter-protests were held by groups like Resist Britain First and Stand Up To Racism Manchester, advocating for inclusivity with signs reading "Refugees welcome" and "Stop the far right."

The day was marked by a heavy police presence, including mounted officers, to maintain order amidst the demonstrations.
