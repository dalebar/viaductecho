Two Isle of Man volunteer firefighters, Andy Lean and Kieran Thomas, tackled their first Hyrox event in heavy firefighting kit, describing it as the toughest challenge they've faced. The duo wore 22lb (10kg) kits during the 8km run which involved exercises like kettlebells and lunges. Kieran struggled with the heat, saying, "I will never do that in firefighting kit again," while both admitted to receiving some bemused looks from fellow competitors. Despite the challenging conditions, the support from the crowd motivated them throughout the race. They finished in an impressive one hour and 35 minutes, raising nearly £1,600 for the mental health charity, Isle Listen. Afterward, the pair celebrated their achievement at a pub and planned a relaxing spa day in Manchester. While Andy is unsure if he’ll join another event in kit again, Kieran is keen to participate, but without the added heat of a uniform.
