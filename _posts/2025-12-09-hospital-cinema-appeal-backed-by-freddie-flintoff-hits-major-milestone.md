The Manchester MediCinema appeal has hit a significant milestone, raising £250,000 towards its goal of £1.1 million to build the region's first in-hospital cinema. Supported by local celebrities like Freddie Flintoff, Coleen and Wayne Rooney, the initiative aims to transform an unused lecture theatre into a fully accessible 50-seat cinema at the Oxford Road Campus, benefiting hospitals like the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and the Manchester Royal Infirmary. The project will provide a valuable escape for patients during long stays, featuring up to 260 films a year, with special adaptations for various needs. Flintoff encourages further donations, suggesting that even a small contribution can have a big impact. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust chair, Kathy Cowell, confirms that every bit helps in making this dream facility a reality for patients and their families. Donations can be made by texting CINEMA2 to 70580 or through the Manchester Foundation Trust Charity’s website.
