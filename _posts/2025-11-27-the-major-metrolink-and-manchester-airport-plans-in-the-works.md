Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) is seriously considering building a new Metrolink stop and tram line for the upgraded Terminal 2 at Manchester Airport, which is part of a £1.3bn development. The proposed tram extension would connect directly from the existing station to Terminal 2, accommodating the expected increase in passenger numbers, projected to rise to 40 million by 2030. Plans involve a new stop on a ‘Western leg’ tram route that would allow for easier access for passengers and staff. As the airport expands, the focus is on ensuring transport infrastructure is fast, affordable, and integrated with local transport networks. This project is part of a broader Greater Manchester Transport Strategy aiming for a fundamental shift in travel habits, reducing car journeys from 60% to half, while enhancing connections across the region through the Bee Network that combines various modes of transport.
