Four people have been arrested after a stabbing outside two primary schools in Bury. The incident occurred around 9:30pm on December 16, with emergency services quickly responding. A 19-year-old man suffered injuries that are not life-threatening. Greater Manchester Police cordoned off the area on Cecil Street, between Holy Trinity CofE and St Marie's RC primary schools, forcing one school to close for the day. Parents were advised not to bring their children in while investigations continued. The suspects include two 23-year-old men and two 16-year-old boys, arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent. Local parents expressed concern, with one describing the situation as "very scary" and "very worrying," especially since she lives nearby. GMP confirmed that the incident is not linked to the schools or Bury College.
