Councillor John Warmisham from Salford has switched to Your Party, founded by ex-Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana. He stepped away from Labour due to frustration with the national leadership's lack of representation for local communities. Warmisham, who has been in politics for over 30 years, is the first Your Party councillor in Greater Manchester. He plans to retire in May 2026 but may support as a ‘paper candidate’ if needed. He expressed that Corbyn’s socialism aligns with his own values, criticising Labour for losing its way and implying they only reversed certain policies under pressure. Despite this, he clarified that his departure wasn't a dig at Salford's local Labour party or Mayor Paul Dennett. He recently attended a rally where he felt a sense of camaraderie with other former Labour members. Salford council has updated its records to show his new affiliation with Your Party.
