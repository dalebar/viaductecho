Robin Smith, a 35-year-old passenger, was left traumatised after being stuck in a train toilet for nearly two hours due to a malfunctioning automatic door. Travelling from Southampton to Manchester for a HYROX event with her partner Angus, Robin's claustrophobia made the ordeal particularly distressing. After failing to open the door and with broken emergency levers, staff struggled to free her, leading to chaotic scenes. Concerned for her safety, Robin requested that the fire service be called, but staff hesitated due to train delays. Eventually, firefighters arrived and cut through the door to rescue her. Afterward, Robin expressed relief at being free and received support throughout the remainder of her journey, while CrossCountry apologised for the incident and highlighted their staff's efforts.
