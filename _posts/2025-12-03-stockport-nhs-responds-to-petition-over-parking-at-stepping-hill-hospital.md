Stockport NHS Trust has addressed a petition from staff about changes to parking at Stepping Hill Hospital, which included barriered staff car parks, tougher enforcement, and a new permit system. Staff requested more designated parking spaces, flexible parking for those with young children or disabilities, and a review of the parking enforcement contract. In response, Chief Executive Karen James explained that the changes aimed to enhance safety and accessibility, as the site previously had issues with obstruction and limited spaces for patients. An overspill car park was opened in October, adding 50 spaces, with another one planned for March that will add 180 more. While the trust acknowledges the parking situation isn’t perfect, they’re committed to listening to concerns and adjusting their approach. They’re also testing longer opening hours for one staff car park. Karen James expressed gratitude for the feedback and promised to keep everyone updated on the developments.
