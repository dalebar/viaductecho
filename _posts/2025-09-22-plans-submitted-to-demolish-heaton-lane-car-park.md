Heaton Lane car park in Stockport could be demolished by the end of 2025, as plans have been submitted by Stockport Council. The proposal involves taking the multi-storey structure down to 'slab level', with existing electric vehicle chargers being relocated within the town centre. If approved, demolition work is set to begin in October 2025 and should wrap up by December 21. To ensure safety during the demolition, Great Egerton Street will be partially closed to keep pedestrians and vehicles clear of the site. The contractor, P.P. O'Connor, promises to manage noise and dust, with measures like dust suppression in place. The expected noise isnâ€™t thought to be excessive, but the site manager will monitor it throughout the process. A decision on the demolition plans is due by October 5.
