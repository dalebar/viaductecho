Salford Red Devils have been wound up after 152 years due to an unpaid tax bill to HMRC, following a tough season that included late wage payments and relegation. The club was set to start the 2026 season against local rivals Oldham but is now facing closure. The winding-up petition, initially brought in June, saw several adjournments, with the last one on December 3rd. Supporters and local businesses are keen to resurrect the team as a ‘phoenix club’ to continue the legacy. Fan group The 1873 expressed the ongoing pain in the situation but remains hopeful for a community-focused future that honours the club's rich history. Salford has a special connection to rugby, being the birthplace of William Webb Ellis, and despite recent difficulties, the area continues to hold close ties to the sport.
