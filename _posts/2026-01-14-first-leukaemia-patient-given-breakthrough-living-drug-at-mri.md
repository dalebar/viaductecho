Oscar Murphy, a 28-year-old car salesman from Bury, became the first leukaemia patient to receive new CAR-T therapy at Manchester Royal Infirmary. This groundbreaking treatment targets his aggressive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, especially following a relapse after previous treatments. Oscar shared how the “living drug” works by modifying T cells to attack cancer, offering hope where traditional therapies fall short. This innovative approach is now being funded by the NHS for up to 50 patients annually, boasting a 77% remission rate and an average life extension of 15.6 months, according to clinical trials. Dr Eleni Tholouli, Oscar's haematologist, highlighted its effectiveness and safety compared to older treatments. Oscar recently completed his second infusion, feeling positive about the future. He even tied the knot in hospital and is keen on building a family and returning to his regular life. His story reflects hope and determination, with aspirations for a normal life ahead.
