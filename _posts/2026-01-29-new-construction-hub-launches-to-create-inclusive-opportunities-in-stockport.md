Stockport Council has just launched the One Stockport Construction Hub, aimed at providing local residents with skills, job opportunities, and training linked to the town’s major regeneration efforts. The Hub, introduced on 28 January, is designed to create long-term opportunities for all residents, particularly focusing on young people and underrepresented groups. By partnering with Trafford College Group and local organisations, the Hub connects residents to various construction roles and supports local businesses in adopting green technologies.

Key initiatives include construction traineeships, a brokerage service that links local job seekers with employers, and a focus on sustainability in construction. Early successes include helping 14 young people secure training and jobs, and supporting a young individual with autism into a supported apprenticeship.

This initiative is part of Stockport's wider 15-year regeneration plan, which seeks to transform the area while ensuring that the benefits of this growth are local and inclusive. As the project unfolds, the Hub aims to keep residents informed about new opportunities arising from this exciting development.
