Great Lever in Bolton has seen a significant clean-up after facing issues with litter and dangerous waste. Volunteers, alongside Bolton council staff, took part in a community action day to tidy up the area, highlighted by an image showing streets littered with bags and debris. With support from Bolton at Home and Onward Homes, the effort included providing an extra skip for rubbish. Coun Richard Silvester emphasised the importance of community pride and responsibility in tackling littering. He encouraged local volunteers, schools, and community groups to join in by organising litter picking events, with the council offering equipment and collection services. Interested individuals can reach out to Bolton council via email for support in keeping the area tidy.
