The Met Office has issued weather warnings for snow and ice across Greater Manchester and much of the UK this weekend. A yellow ice warning starts at 5pm today and lasts until 10am tomorrow, with temperatures dropping below freezing and a risk of icy patches on untreated surfaces. Another yellow warning for snow and ice kicks in at 9pm on Saturday, lasting until 10am Sunday, particularly affecting Scotland and northern England. Forecasters predict possible snowfall of 1-3cm at low levels, 3-7cm on higher ground, and up to 10-15cm above 400m elevation. Travel disruption is expected, especially over high ground, as rain may initially fall as snow before milder air moves in, likely changing snow to rain. Icy conditions are also a concern, particularly in northeast England and parts of Scotland. Keep an eye out for slippery roads and paths!
