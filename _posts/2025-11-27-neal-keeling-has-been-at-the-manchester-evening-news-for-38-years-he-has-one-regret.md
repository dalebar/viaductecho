In September 1987, Neal made his debut at the Manchester Evening News, navigating the vibrant, bustling world of newsroom life in a pre-digital age. He recounts the adrenaline of reporting on an explosion in Salford, which sparked his passion for journalism. Those early years were marked by a raucous newsroom filled with seasoned reporters and a distinct drinking culture. Neal forged his skills on the streets of Salford, building trust with locals and police as he covered everything from crime to community stories. 

Over his career, he witnessed profound moments, like reporting on tragic events and uncovering failures in response to crises, such as the Manchester Arena attack. He highlights the importance of connecting with the community and the evolution of journalism in adapting from direct human interactions to more bureaucratic encounters. Despite the challenges, Neal’s commitment to capturing the essence of Greater Manchester remains. As he approaches burnout at 66, he reflects on the personal sacrifices made for his career at MEN, emphasizing the joy and privilege of storytelling in a city rich with history and resilience.
