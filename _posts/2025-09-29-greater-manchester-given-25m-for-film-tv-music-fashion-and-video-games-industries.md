Greater Manchester's set to receive £25m to boost its film, TV, music, fashion, and video game sectors, as announced by Labour’s culture secretary Lisa Nandy at the party conference in Liverpool. This funding is part of a £150m Creative Places Growth Fund, aimed at fostering creative industries outside London. Nandy stressed the importance of empowering local regions rather than top-down decisions from central government. Each of the six selected regions will get £25m over three years, starting next financial year, to support creative professionals, businesses, and young talent with finance, mentoring, and networking opportunities. Alongside this, over 100 small creative enterprises across 12 regions will also share £8m to help scale up their businesses. This initiative signals a significant shift towards a 'new approach' in culture funding.
