The A628 Woodhead Pass in Yorkshire will close in both directions from 8pm on Thursday, January 8, due to heavy snow expected with Storm Goretti. The closure affects the stretch between A616 Flouch and A57 Hollingworth, prompted by amber weather alerts in the region. The Met Office has warned of strong winds, snow, and rain across the UK, with South and West Yorkshire under an amber alert and Greater Manchester a yellow one. They advise against driving in these conditions but suggest planning routes and allowing extra time if necessary. Essential items for the car, like warm clothing and food, should be packed for delays. National Highways reported a significant rise in winter breakdowns, leading to a campaign urging drivers to check fuel, rest frequently, inspect tyres, and prepare for weather. They're also working to ensure safety measures on the roads, including readying gritters and salt supplies. Stay safe out there!
