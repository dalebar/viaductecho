With Manchester's detached house prices nearing £500,000, many families are seeking homes in nearby Lancashire, which offers good transport links and a quieter lifestyle. New housing estates near Blackburn and Darwen are popping up, with over 1,500 homes in the works, appealing particularly to those from the city. Prices start around £200,000 for a three-bed semi, attracting lots of young families looking to escape the urban hustle. However, locals point out that infrastructure improvements lag behind population growth, particularly on narrow routes like Broken Stone Road. Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council has acknowledged the need for better services, but plans for schools and transport upgrades are slow to materialise. A significant sum of £6.8 million is expected from a development agreement to address these issues, but council leader Phil Riley insists they haven't failed in their responsibilities regarding infrastructure. The debate continues as to whether the proper facilities will keep pace with the influx of new residents and vehicles.
