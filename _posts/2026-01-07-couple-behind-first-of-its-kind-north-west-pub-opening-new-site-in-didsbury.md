Evelyn and Xavier Bastian, the couple behind the viral Ale & Aloo Indian gastropub in Wigan, are set to launch a new café and wine bar named Parosna in Didsbury, targeting an opening in early to mid-February. The venue, taking over the former OKitchen site, will focus on a menu that encourages sharing, inspired by Indian dining traditions. Evelyn describes Parosna as a community hub where guests can enjoy all-day brunch and relaxed evening meals, complete with a cosy atmosphere. The menu will feature a variety of small and large plates, blending Indian flavours with seasonal ingredients, and offering affordable options. While aiming to create a family-friendly environment with activities for kids and dog-friendly spaces, they’re excited about the potential footfall in Didsbury. Regular updates will be shared on the Parosna by Ale & Aloo Facebook page.
