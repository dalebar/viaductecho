Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is hosting a free 'Mayor's Question Time' event at Edgeley Park on Thursday, 18 September, starting at 7.30pm. Attendees can submit one concise question when registering, which will be shortlisted by a local journalist for the mayor to address. There will also be a chance to ask additional questions on the night. While advance registration is recommended, there may be spots available for walk-ins. These events occur quarterly at various locations in Greater Manchester, offering everyone a chance to have their say on important issues. For more details or to register, check out the event page.
