Stockport’s come in fifth in a study by Markel, showcasing it as one of the top spots in the UK for aspiring entrepreneurs. The study ranked cities based on startup survival rates, closure rates, and household income. Belfast topped the list, with Stockport outperforming nearby cities like Manchester, Salford, and Liverpool. It scored a fantastic 9.2 out of 10 for small business survival, reflecting solid prospects for long-term success. With low closure rates and growing disposable income, there's plenty of cash flow for new ventures. Broadband speed in Stockport also got a high score, vital for a business’s early days. Markel's Rob Rees summed it up, stating that while various factors influence business success, access to resources like fast internet and local support networks can significantly boost new startups.
