Gorton and Denton are gearing up for a by-election next week on February 26, following Andrew Gwynne's resignation. He stepped down citing health issues, amid backlash after controversial WhatsApp messages were leaked. A mix of candidates are vying for the seat, including Matt Goodwin from Reform UK, Angeliki Stogia representing Labour, and others from parties like the Green Party, Conservatives, and Liberal Democrats. The election has sparked political tension, seen as a reflection on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership and the Labour government, with strong competition from the Green Party and Reform UK. The past four weeks have been chaotic, featuring press conferences, door-to-door campaigning, and various mishaps like misspelled names and allegations of election violations. It's all shaping up to be an interesting contest!
