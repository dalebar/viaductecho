The Japanese ambassador to the UK, Hiroshi Suzuki, nearly polished off a pint of Boddingtons while celebrating a new sister city deal between Manchester and Osaka aimed at boosting trade and cultural ties. This agreement comes with a backdrop of significant Japanese investment in Greater Manchester, totalling £117 million over the past year, leading to the creation of over 200 jobs. The deal, signed by Mayors Andy Burnham and Hideyuki Yokoyama at Manchester Metropolitan University, revives a historic connection dating back to the 19th century when Japanese students visited to learn about British manufacturing. Both cities have strong textile manufacturing roots, with Osaka once dubbed the "Manchester of the East." Mayor Burnham expressed excitement about future collaborations fostering investment and innovation. Suzuki’s fondness for local treats, including Eccles cakes, shows his growing affection for Manchester. The celebration coincides with Japan Week, a cultural festival running from 4 to 9 September, marking a joyful renewal of ties between the two cities.
