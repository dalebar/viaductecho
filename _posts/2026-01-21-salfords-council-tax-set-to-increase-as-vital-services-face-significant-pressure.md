Salford council is planning a 4.99% council tax increase, adding around £102 to bills for over 80,000 households. If approved, this would raise Salford's council tax income to £173 million by 2025/26. The proposed increase includes a 2% adult social care precept to support vital services, in light of rising costs and demand, particularly in adult social care and temporary accommodation. Salford Mayor Paul Dennett and his cabinet will discuss these plans on January 27, before a council vote. The overall budget stands at £439 million, but by 2028/29, the council anticipates a cumulative budget gap of £33 million, which may require cuts and efficiency measures. The report emphasizes a balanced approach to addressing service demand and investment priorities.
