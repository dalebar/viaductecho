Sabena Khan, a disabled woman from Bramhall, Stockport, is in a dire situation due to a mix-up with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) regarding her benefits. Suffering from cerebral palsy and rheumatoid arthritis, the 47-year-old relies on care funding and has been left with £200 less a month. This has led her to depend on foodbanks and struggle with basic expenses. Despite her direct payments being meant for care, the DWP mistakenly classified them as personal savings, impacting her financial support. Cheadle MP Tom Morrison has condemned the DWP's handling, stating they ignored repeated requests for clarification, leaving Sabena without crucial support for months. The stress has severely affected her mental health, increasing anxiety and leading to suicidal thoughts. Sabena has called for understanding from the DWP about her struggles, emphasising that her disability limits her work options and the financial strain is unbearable. Stockport Council is in talks with the DWP to ensure she receives the necessary support.
