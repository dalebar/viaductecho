Developers are looking to build over 1,000 new homes in Woodford, Stockport, with plans for 554 homes by Russell LDP and 450 homes by David Wilson Homes, both including affordable options. The developments aim to create a 'logical extension' to the area, with added facilities like shops, a medical centre, and parks. However, local councillor Peter Crossen expressed frustration over the rapid development and lack of infrastructure support, accusing the council of failing to manage the situation effectively. Stockport council has been urged by the government to finalise a local plan after delays, with critics highlighting the risk to green spaces. Council leader Mark Roberts defended their efforts, stating that the Liberal Democrats are working to balance housing needs with green belt protection and urged residents to take a stance against increased housing targets set by the Labour government.
