Protesters supporting Palestine have gathered outside Manchester Cathedral for a march through the city centre. A few hundred attendees are waving flags and holding placards, with speeches happening before the march kicks off. Police are present to monitor the situation. The event is organised by Greater Manchester Friends of Palestine and continues a series of such demonstrations in the area.

Tensions briefly escalated during the speeches, with discussions about what to do if arrested. Protesters have also expressed concerns over a recent crackdown by Greater Manchester Police on the phrase "globalise the intifada," especially following anti-Semitic incidents. Organisers have assured that this phrase won't be used today.

As the crowd marches down Deansgate, the atmosphere remains charged with energy, and updates are being provided live from the scene. Overall, it's a vibrant display of solidarity, with many discussions surrounding political issues and support for those on hunger strike.
