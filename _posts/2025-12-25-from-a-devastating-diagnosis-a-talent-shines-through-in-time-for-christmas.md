This Christmas, Manchester’s city centre will host a remarkable art exhibition featuring the work of 14-year-old Sophia Faulkner, who faced leukaemia at a young age. Despite her illness, art became her escape, helping her cope during tough hospital stays. Now, her sketches will be on display at the Great Northern Warehouse until January 9, 2026, showcasing 15 framed pieces, made possible by local businesses and the Teenage Cancer Trust. Sophia's mother, Christine, shared how pivotal the support from Jen Duggan, a youth coordinator, has been in Sophia’s journey, providing both friendship and creative inspiration. With plans to attend art college post-GCSEs, Sophia's talent shines through her works – a mix of dark and light themes reflecting her experiences. The exhibition not only highlights her artistic resilience but also raises awareness for young cancer patients. Special thanks go to those who helped bring this exhibition to life, emphasising the importance of community support in navigating such challenges.
