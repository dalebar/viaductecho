Residents of Hazel Grove are being invited to share their thoughts on plans for up to 175 new homes off Mill Street, behind Sainsbury's. The site, currently green belt, is set to become 'grey belt' land and could include 87 affordable homes, car parking, a children’s play area, and green spaces. Access will be via the traffic lights near Sainsbury’s, with potential for a future link road. The consultation period ends on 20 March, and flyers have been sent to over 5,000 households. Cllr Dan Oliver emphasised that while the land is greenbelt, the Government has allowed developments like this one under the Local Plan. Residents can take part in an online consultation and attend a public drop-in event on 5 March at St. Peter's Parish Centre from 4pm to 8pm.
