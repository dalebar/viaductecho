The Turner Brothers factory in Rochdale, infamous for being the world's largest asbestos manufacturer, has been largely abandoned since its closure in the 1990s. Recent developments in 2025 suggest potential redevelopment plans by Spodden Park Ltd, which could include hundreds of new homes and green spaces. Local residents, who remember the factory's bustling history, view the site as an eyesore and a danger due to recent trespasser incidents and previous fires. While some are keen on housing development, there are concerns regarding asbestos safety. Spodden Park is working with remediation specialists, emphasising the need for rigorous assessments before moving forward. A community consultation is set for early 2026, hoping to engage locals in the redevelopment process and address safety issues. Despite past failed proposals, there's a palpable hope for revitalising the area and finally putting an end to the mystery surrounding the factory's future.
