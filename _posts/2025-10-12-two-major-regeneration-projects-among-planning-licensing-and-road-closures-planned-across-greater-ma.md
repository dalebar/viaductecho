Manchester and Salford are gearing up for major regeneration projects. Wythenshawe's £500 million plan will revamp the town centre with thousands of new homes, a culture hub, greenspaces, a food hall, and a larger public square. The transformation includes demolishing parts of the Civic Centre to make room for 2,000 new homes, while converting existing buildings into flats.

Over in Salford, £2.5 billion is being invested in the Salford Crescent scheme, which will see 800 new homes, with plans for 185 apartments on Cleminson Street already moving forward. 

In other developments, Bolton council has agreed to sell land for a new car park next to a mosque, amidst some concerns raised by councillors. Meanwhile, Stockport’s leader criticises a proposal for a new 20,000-home town near the Greater Manchester border, calling it poorly thought out. Lastly, the Mottram bypass project seeks to alleviate long-standing traffic congestion, with necessary road closures in place for bridge replacement works expected to last until 2026.
