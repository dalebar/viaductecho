High Peak Comps is running some smashing prize draws this Christmas, including a massive £100,000 giveaway for just 99p per ticket! You can enter up to 3,000 times, and the winner will be revealed live on Facebook at 1pm on Christmas Day. There's also a £20,000 tax-free cash draw for only 20p per ticket, closing on 14th December, with a live draw set for that evening.

Aside from the exciting competitions, High Peak Comps is also committed to giving back to the community, supporting local charities and causes with donations ranging from raffle prizes to cash contributions.
