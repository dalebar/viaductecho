Manchester Airport's revamped Terminal 2 is now fully open, marking the completion of a decade-long £1.3 billion renovation. This new 'super terminal' hosts nearly all airlines and features a spacious departure lounge accessible from both ends of a giant security hall. While most areas are open, a few retailers and eateries are still set to launch. Highlights include the stylish new 'Boutique Mall' and a Fever Tree Champagne and Cocktail bar, with luxury names like Chanel arriving early next year. Next up, The Great Northern Market will offer pop-up street food and the airport's first Wetherspoons, both expected to open next year. A new World Duty Free store has also joined the mix, alongside fresh WHSmith, Costa, and Greggs spots in the arrivals area. It’s a significant milestone in a substantial investment for the airport!
