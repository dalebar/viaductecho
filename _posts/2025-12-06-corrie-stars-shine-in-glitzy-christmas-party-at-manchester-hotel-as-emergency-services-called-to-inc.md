Last night, the stars of Coronation Street brought some sparkle to Manchester city centre for a festive party at the Refuge Restaurant and Bar. Glamorous attendees included Bill Roach, Jack P Shepherd, Sally Dynevor, Lucy Fallon, Catherine Tyldesley, and Tanisha Gorey. 

However, the evening took a turn when two pedestrians were reportedly struck by a taxi on Oxford Road, near the Palace Theatre. Eyewitnesses suggested the young individuals stepped out in front of the taxi and, while they didn't sustain serious injuries, they were left a bit shaken. Bystanders and emergency services quickly rushed to help.

Check out the gallery for all the fab photos from the night!
