Stockport council is in serious financial trouble, facing a £75 million funding gap over the next five years. The Lib Dem-led council is struggling with rising costs for over 800 services and is considering job cuts and increased parking charges to balance the budget. Last year, it introduced a £59 fee for garden waste collection and raised council tax by nearly 5%. Council leader Mark Roberts has written to the government, urging fairer funding, as Stockport missed out on the Recovery Grant for the second time, which was aimed at helping areas in greater need. He highlighted that the expected funding increase for Stockport is significantly less than the national average, pushing taxpayers to bear more of the local service costs. The government has offered £356.1 million to Stockport, claiming it's part of a larger £78 billion funding boost for councils next year. However, concerns linger about the adequacy of this support given Stockport’s financial struggles and its implications for local services.
