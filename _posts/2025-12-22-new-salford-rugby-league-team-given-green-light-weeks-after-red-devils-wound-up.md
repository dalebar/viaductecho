A new rugby league team in Salford has been given the green light after a tough period for the Salford Red Devils, which saw the club wound up due to financial troubles. The 152-year-old club faced a crisis but is now under new ownership through Salford RLFC Ltd, set to compete in the Betfred Championship starting January 2026. The Mayor of Salford, Paul Dennett, expressed optimism about the team’s future, emphasising the need for unity among fans and the community. The new Red Devils, led by former player Mason Caton-Brown, will kick off the season against Oldham RLFC. The Rugby Football League (RFL) selected this ownership from several proposals, highlighting a commitment to professional rugby league in Salford. RFL Interim CEO Abi Ekoku noted the decision aims to ensure stability and growth for the club and local community, turning the page on a challenging chapter.
