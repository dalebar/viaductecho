A stunning Victorian five-bedroom home has hit the market in Didsbury, one of Manchester's most desirable areas, up for £985,000. This four-storey terraced house, now our Property of the Week, features a blend of period charm and modern living with large bay windows, high ceilings, and original fireplaces. Located on Circular Road, it's a short stroll from the trendy Burton Road, known for its boutiques and eateries.

Inside, you'll find a spacious layout including a bay-fronted lounge, an open-plan kitchen dining area, and two converted basement bedrooms. The first floor has two double bedrooms and a luxe bathroom, while the entire second floor is dedicated to a master suite with en-suite and dressing area. The garden offers a paved area, lawn, and a roofed decking spot for outdoor dining. There's also front driveway parking available.

The property is situated in a lovely, calm residential street, close to transport links and family-friendly amenities like the Albert Tennis Club. JP & Brimelow Estate Agents highly recommend viewing—it’s an absolute gem!
