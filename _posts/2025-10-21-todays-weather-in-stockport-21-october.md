Tuesday's weather in Stockport is set to be quite grey, with persistent cloud cover and a 100% chance of rain. Temperatures will hover between a cool 10°C and 13°C. Expect high humidity at 92%, making it feel even damper. A brisk wind at around 18mph will add to the chill, so it's best to wrap up warm. 

If you’re out and about, definitely wear waterproofs and bring an umbrella, as showers are likely to pop up throughout the day. Watch out for slippery roads while commuting, especially if you’re driving or cycling. 

With all this weather, it’s a good excuse to stay indoors and enjoy some inside activities. If you have to venture outside, just be sure to dress appropriately. Oh, and a heads up—checking your gutters might be wise to handle the wet weather!
