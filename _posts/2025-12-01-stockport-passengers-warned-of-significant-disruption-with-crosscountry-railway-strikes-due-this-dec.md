Staff at CrossCountry will strike on Saturday, 6 December, causing 'very limited' services and 'significant disruption' through Stockport. Further action is planned on 13 and 20 December, with more updates to come. Any trains that do operate are expected to be 'significantly busier' and will finish earlier in the day, so passengers are urged to plan their return journeys wisely. CrossCountry runs trains on the popular Birmingham to Manchester route, including Stockport. Shiona Rolfe, the managing director, expressed disappointment over the strike announcement, emphasising their efforts to reach a fair agreement and minimise disruption during the festive season. For more information, check the CrossCountry website.
