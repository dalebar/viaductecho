Residents near Greater Manchester are fuming over plans for a new town in Adlington, which could add up to 20,000 homes on 2,400 acres of greenbelt. Locals argue the development risks merging Stockport and Macclesfield into “one big housing estate,” straining local services and roads already at full capacity. The project, costing £8 billion and advocated by developers Belport, promises amenities like schools and health centres, yet many villagers worry it’ll destroy the landscape and wildlife, impacting local farmers’ livelihoods. One resident, Aysha Hawcutt, highlighted the emotional toll, as she faces losing her beloved walking spots. Critics also question the starting house price of around £400,000, deeming it far from genuinely affordable. Protests have arisen, with locals feeling their voices are overlooked in what they see as a rushed decision. Cheshire East Council is set to discuss the proposals in January, amid concerns over infrastructure, ecology, and community spirit.
