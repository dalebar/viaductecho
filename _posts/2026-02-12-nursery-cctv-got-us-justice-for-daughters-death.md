The parents of Genevieve Meehan, a nine-month-old girl who tragically died at Tiny Toes nursery in Stockport, are advocating for compulsory CCTV in nurseries. After Genevieve suffocated due to negligence, her parents, John Meehan and Katie Wheeler, launched the Campaign for Gigi to push for improved safety measures. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suggested that CCTV could become mandatory following several child abuse cases, including the tragic abuse by a nursery worker in London. Wheeler highlighted that CCTV not only serves as a deterrent but also aids in providing justice for families when incidents occur. It played a key role in the legal proceedings following Genevieve's death, which resulted in the deputy manager being convicted of manslaughter. Despite the push for change, Wheeler expressed frustration that more hasn’t been done to prevent such tragedies. The government is currently reviewing its safeguarding measures, including enhanced Ofsted inspections and new guidance on CCTV in early years settings.
