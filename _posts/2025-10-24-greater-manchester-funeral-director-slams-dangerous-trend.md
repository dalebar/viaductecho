A funeral service in Rochdale is appealing for motorists to show more respect during funeral processions. Ian Leary, who runs Middleton's Funeral Services, expressed frustration over impatient drivers who attempt to cut into the cortege, sometimes even squeezing between hearses and limousines. This behaviour has made an already difficult time for grieving families even worse, with dangerous near-misses reported. Ian took to Facebook to encourage the public to pause and pay their respects when encountering a funeral procession, suggesting people could bow their heads or remove their caps as a sign of honour. His post has received widespread support, highlighting a perceived decline in public respect for such solemn occasions. Ian noted that in his experience as a funeral director, the frequency of this disrespect has increased, possibly due to the fast pace of modern life. He hopes to revive an old tradition of collective respect during funerals, as these moments are about honouring someone's final journey.
