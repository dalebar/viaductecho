A tragic incident occurred this morning outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester during Yom Kippur. Police were called at 9.31am after a member of the public reported a car driven towards people, with firearms officers arriving just three minutes later. The suspect was shot and killed after attacking a security guard and several others with a knife, leading to the deaths of two members of the public and three others injured seriously. 

Witness Chava Lewin described the chaos as people barricaded doors and residents were in shock. A large cordon was established, and security measures across Manchester were heightened. The suspect was reportedly believed to have had an explosive device, although its viability hasnâ€™t been confirmed. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed his horror at the attack, deeming it especially horrific due to its timing on a significant Jewish holiday. A timeline of events details the quick police response and subsequent updates throughout the day, including a loud bang from the suspect's vehicle due to safety precautions taken by bomb disposal teams.
