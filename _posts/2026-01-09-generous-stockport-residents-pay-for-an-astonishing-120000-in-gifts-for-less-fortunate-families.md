Stockport residents donated around £120,000 in gifts for children and families this Christmas through The Giving Tree initiative, hosted at Merseyway Shopping Centre. A decorated Christmas tree displayed red tags with gift requests from families in need, encouraging shoppers to buy gifts and drop them off for distribution. This year was particularly successful, marking the seven-year initiative's most impactful season, benefiting homeless families, youth groups, and local schools, ensuring thousands of children received gifts. The scheme also supported Women in Refuge and hospital patients at Wythenshawe and Stepping Hill. Victoria Nichol, the centre manager, praised the community's generosity, highlighting the collaboration between volunteers, local businesses, and shoppers, ensuring every child receives a gift on Christmas morning. Key supporters included British Gas, Starkey, Gorvins Solicitors, and Stockport County FC, along with various local shops and groups.
