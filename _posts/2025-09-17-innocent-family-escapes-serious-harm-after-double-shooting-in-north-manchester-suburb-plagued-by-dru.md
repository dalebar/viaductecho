Residents in north Manchester were left in shock after a double shooting on a local estate. The first incident occurred on Ainthorpe Walk where shots were fired through a homeâ€™s window, narrowly missing an innocent couple and their young son. Fortunately, the family escaped serious harm, though one man, not believed to be the target, sustained a minor injury. Shortly after, a second shooting happened on Ballantine Street, with no reported injuries. Locals described hearing various sounds, initially thinking they were backfiring mopeds, unaware of the severity until police arrived. Many residents expressed concerns about the rising youth crime and drug-dealing in the area, which has changed drastically over the years. Greater Manchester Police are treating both incidents as linked and are actively investigating, with increased patrols in the area. They're appealing for any witnesses or footage to aid their investigation. Detective Inspector Terina Arthern emphasised the need for community support in tackling such dangerous incidents. Anyone with information is encouraged to reach out to the police.
