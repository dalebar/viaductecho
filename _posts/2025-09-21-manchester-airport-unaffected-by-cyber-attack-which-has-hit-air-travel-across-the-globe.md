Manchester Airport is sailing smoothly despite a cyber attack affecting other major European airports like Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. A spokesperson for Manchester confirmed they weren't reliant on the compromised system from Collins Aerospace, so there’ve been no major disruptions there. Meanwhile, passengers at Heathrow faced lengthy queues and delays, with some flights cancelled or delayed due to the tech issues that emerged on Friday night. The chaos has led to passengers being advised to check flight statuses before heading to the airport. Collins Aerospace is working to resolve their issues and noted the impact is mainly on electronic check-in and baggage drop, but manual operations can keep things moving. The European Commission assured that while disruptions are occurring, aviation safety and air traffic control remain unaffected. They’re keeping an eye on the situation and collaborating to get things back to normal.
