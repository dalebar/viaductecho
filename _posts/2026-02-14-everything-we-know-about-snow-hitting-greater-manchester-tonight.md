Greater Manchester is soaking up some lovely Valentine's Day sunshine, described by a Met Office forecaster as 'the best day we've seen for some time'. However, brace yourselves, as a yellow weather warning for snow and ice kicks in at 9pm tonight and lasts until 10am Sunday morning. The Met Office warns that snow, especially heavy at times, could disrupt travel, particularly on high ground over Saturday night and into Sunday. Areas affected include north and east Manchester, as well as Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, and parts of Salford and Wigan. Expect rain and sleet from around 10pm, turning to snow by 11pm, with heavier snowfall forecast in the early hours. Conditions should clear by 5am, giving way to a mostly dry Sunday morning. Just when you think it’s safe, heavy rain is set to return from 11:30am until 1:30pm, with more showers throughout the afternoon and evening.
