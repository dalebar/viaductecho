A North West Ambulance Service director, Daniel Ainsworth, admitted they lacked the resources to train all staff following recommendations from the Manchester Arena bombing inquiry. He mentioned ongoing talks with NHS England and noted some confusion over the timing of declaring a major incident during the Southport killings. Evidence showed the incident was declared at 12.25pm, though he believed it could have been done earlier.

During the inquiry, Chief Inspector Andrew Hughes from Merseyside Police expressed disbelief over how a single attacker, Axel Rudakubana, could cause so many injuries during a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in July 2022. He discussed how unarmed officers were sent to the scene while armed units covered the area. The response was complicated by the number of casualties and a need for rapid assessment of the situation. Despite the chaos of the incident, Hughes felt prepared and not overwhelmed. The inquiry continues, with taxi driver Gary Poland expected to give evidence next.
