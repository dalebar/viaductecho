Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has thrown his support behind Trafford Council as it grapples with the risk of bankruptcy. He asserts that the council's current leadership isn't at fault, blaming past decisions from a decade ago. Trafford announced a 7.49% council tax increase for the second year running, citing past tax freezes under Conservative rule as a contributing factor to its financial woes. Burnham also slammed the Government's funding allocation, noting that Trafford is about £24 million worse off than anticipated over the next three years. The council, led by Labour's Tom Ross, acknowledges the tax hike is unpopular but necessary to begin fixing its financial issues. However, this revenue won't fully resolve the council's problems, which also require a £20 million government loan to avoid declaring bankruptcy. The local Green Party has called for urgent intervention, urging Trafford's MPs to secure a transitional grant, highlighting the area’s socio-economic disparities and an increasing elderly population that strains resources.
