Stockport's town centre is set for a big makeover with nearly £10m in funding from the government, focusing on greener travel options and upgrades to the railway station. Over £4m is allocated for improvements at Stockport railway station, enhancing pedestrian access, particularly from the Edgeley side and creating a shortcut ramp from Thompson Street. There's also an aim to improve commuter services. Around £5.5m will go towards developing pedestrian and cycle links in the western area of the town centre, coinciding with the £350m Stockport 8 regeneration project near the Viaduct, planned to bring 1,300 new homes. Councillors discussed the transport updates, aiming to coordinate better pedestrian, cycling, and vehicle connections as the area evolves. Coun Grace Baynham emphasised modernising the station to meet 21st-century standards and improve transport capacity, which is vital for Stockport's economic growth.
