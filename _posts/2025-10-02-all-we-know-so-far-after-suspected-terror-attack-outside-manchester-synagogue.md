Armed police shot a suspect following a suspected terror attack outside a synagogue in north Manchester this morning. Four people were injured when a car was driven at a crowd outside Heaton Park Synagogue in Crumpsall around 9.30am. Reports of a stabbing involving a security guard prompted the deployment of firearms officers. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) treated the incident as a terror threat, declaring a major incident shortly after. Paramedics arrived quickly to assist the injured, while it's advised for the public to steer clear of the area. The attack coincided with the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur. Mayor Andy Burnham reassured the public, saying the situation was under control and praising the prompt response from police and on-site security. Further updates are awaited from the authorities.
