A former mill in Heaton Norris, known as The Ropeworks, is for sale, offering a great chance for residential development. Spanning 10,000 sq ft on Stanbank Street, it comes with planning permission for 34 new homes: four houses and 30 apartments. Initially, plans to convert the mill into luxury flats were set in motion in 2016, but these fell through by 2020, leaving the building empty and damaged. Recent planning approvals by Stockport Council in Summer 2024 could lead to a revamp of the site. The project aims to maintain the original facade while rejuvenating the area, which is conveniently located with good access to Manchester and surrounding locales. No price has been listed yet, but offers are welcome from potential buyers.
