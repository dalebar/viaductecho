The Ropeworks, a former mill in Heaton Norris, is on the market with planning permission for 34 new homes—four houses and 30 apartments. Originally approved for conversion in 2016, the project was taken over by a developer in 2020, who planned to invest £6.5 million into luxury apartments, but it never materialised, leaving the building vacant and deteriorating. Local concerns arose due to falling bricks risking damage to parked cars. However, after Stockport Council granted additional planning permission in Summer 2024, the site was listed for sale by Landwood Group in July. The development aims to retain much of the original mill façade while revitalising the area. Located on Stanbank Street, close to Manchester Road, it's seen as a prime spot for residential development, with easy access to Heaton Chapel, Reddish, Stockport, and the city centre. Offers are being invited; an asking price hasn't been disclosed yet.
