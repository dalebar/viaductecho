A former mill in Heaton Norris, known as The Ropeworks, is on the market with planning permission for 34 new homes, including four houses and 30 apartments. The 10,000 sq ft building on Stanbank Street has been empty since a developer's failed £6.5m conversion plan in 2020. The mill has suffered some damage recently, prompting local concerns. However, fresh planning approval from Stockport Council was granted in Summer 2024, and the site is now listed for sale by Landwood Group. The development aims to preserve the original facade while revitalising the area. Located near Manchester Road, the site offers good connectivity to Heaton Chapel, Reddish, and Stockport and is well-suited for residential use. Offers are invited from interested buyers, but there’s no set price listed.
