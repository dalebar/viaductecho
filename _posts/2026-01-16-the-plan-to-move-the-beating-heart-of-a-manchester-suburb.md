Gorton is set for a transformation with a £60m regeneration plan from Manchester council. The official centre will shift from Hyde Road to Garratt Way, behind Tesco, creating a ‘new town square’ and hundreds of homes. This change, backed by local consultations, aims to turn Gorton into a neighbourhood residents can be proud of. The council's focus includes investing in district centres to support local economies and provide affordable housing. Plans involve building at least 400 homes in the area, starting with a six-storey block of 70 affordable apartments and flats for young care leavers. Upgrades to Gorton Market Hall are also in the pipeline, including an outdoor seating area and a new food and drink zone. This revitalisation is just the beginning for Gorton, which has already seen improvements like the Gorton Hub and a public square from the Tesco car park.
