Belinda Lehane, a disabled motorist from Accrington, received a Â£25 parking fine while parked in what she thought was a disabled bay at the Arndale Centre in Manchester. Despite displaying her blue disability badge and having a year's permit from APCOA, she found herself ticketed along with four other badge holders after a parking attendant claimed the space was no longer designated for disabled parking, despite the wheelchair symbol still being painted there.
