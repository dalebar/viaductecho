Two men, Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein, were found guilty of plotting an Islamic State-inspired gun attack on the Jewish community in northwest England. They denied terror charges related to arranging firearms purchases and planning attacks between December 2023 and May 2024, targeting a pro-Israel march and Jewish areas in Manchester. Walid claimed he was pressured into the plot but intended to sabotage it. His brother, Bilel Saadaoui, was also found guilty by a majority verdict for failing to disclose information related to the plot. The jury's verdicts came after a difficult trial at Preston Crown Court, with the judge commending their attention to the case. The defendants will face sentencing on February 13. The operation could have led to a devastating attack had it not been stopped, according to a senior counter-terrorism official.
