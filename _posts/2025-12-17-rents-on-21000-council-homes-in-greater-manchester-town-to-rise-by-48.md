Wigan's council plans to hike rents on its 21,000 council homes by 4.8% from April 2026, a decision backed by the housing advisory panel and set for cabinet approval. This increase is necessary due to a £35m shortfall in the Housing Revenue Account, which finances rent management and property maintenance. The government's new rules allow social landlords to raise rents by the Consumer Price Index plus 1% annually for the next decade.

The increase is expected to generate an extra £5m for housing, which panel chair Coun Susan Gambles argues is needed to recover from previous rent caps and reductions. Other panel members acknowledged ongoing maintenance challenges, particularly with older properties. Coun John Harding noted the importance of tenant representatives in decision-making, while Coun Phyllis Cullen highlighted the need for significant repairs.

Comparative rental figures show that council rents are substantially lower than private market rates. Additionally, rents for Wigan's garages will also rise by 4.8%, with the average price moving from £7.54 to £7.74.
