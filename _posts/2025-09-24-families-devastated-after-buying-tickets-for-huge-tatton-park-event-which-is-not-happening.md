Families are fuming after being informed that a dinosaur-themed event called The Lost Kingdom, set to take place at Tatton Park this autumn, has been cancelled. While events have successfully run in other UK locations, Tatton Park clarified that it never officially confirmed hosting the event. Despite ticket sales still happening on the Fever website, Tatton Park advised against purchasing tickets, as they were unable to reach a contractual agreement with the event organisers. This led to confusion and frustration among ticket holders, with many wondering how to get their money back for the tickets they bought. The Lost Kingdom promised exciting attractions like animatronic dinosaurs and various activities for kids, but reviews from previous events have been mixed, with some attendees expressing dissatisfaction. The park issued a public notice on Facebook to inform potential attendees, and ticket seller Fever stated they are looking into the situation as customers seek clarity and refunds. Overall, itâ€™s a bit of a mess, leaving families in the lurch and eager for answers.
