A mural in Middleton, celebrating the town's history and the Peterloo Massacre, has been vandalised. The 40-metre artwork, created by artists Evan Barlow and Elizabeth Chandler, was marred by someone whitewashing a child’s face and adding the words “Broken Britain.” Local resident David Chamarette commented on the mural's significance, mentioning the historical details and the artistic talent behind it. Evan confirmed the damage, noting that the child depicted is his son, and expressed his suspicion that the vandal is likely an older, bitter individual, rather than a young person. He plans to restore the mural, which includes references to local pubs and historical events. Evan, a Middleton artist, aims to beautify urban spaces through his work and has only seen a few of his pieces defaced in his 20-year career. The mural, located on the side of a Pound Shop, serves as a poignant reminder of Middleton's heritage.
