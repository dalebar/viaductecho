An inquest is set to be held at South Manchester Coroner's Court following the discovery of a body near Marple Aqueduct. The deceased, identified as 52-year-old Tina Burgess, was found on the grass by the canal on Friday, 22 August, after police received reports of a welfare concern. Emergency services responded, and the canal towpath was cordoned off, with the public advised to steer clear of the area. Authorities are continuing their investigations, and the Coroner's Court has confirmed that the case has been officially referred to them.
