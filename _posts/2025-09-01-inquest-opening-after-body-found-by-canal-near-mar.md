An inquest is set to begin at South Manchester Coroner's Court following the discovery of a body by the canal at Marple Aqueduct. The deceased has been identified as 52-year-old Tina Burgess, found on 22 August after police responded to concerns for her welfare. Emergency services cordoned off the canal towpath, urging the public to steer clear of the area. Police are continuing their investigations, and the case has been referred to the coroner's office.
