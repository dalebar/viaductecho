A significant police operation targeted an organised crime gang in Greater Manchester, resulting in multiple raids across 22 properties and the arrest of 23 individuals, including six boys aged between 13 and 17. Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson highlighted the gang's exploitation of vulnerable children, some as young as 12, who are used as drug mules in a county lines operation. Officers seized weapons, drugs, cash totalling £3,000, and valuables worth over £40,000 during the raids, which involved 258 officers. Detective Superintendent Joe Harrop stated that this operation marks a major step in dismantling the gang, which has inflicted significant harm on local communities. The police emphasised their ongoing commitment to tackling organised crime, ensuring that they are relentless in pursuit of those involved.
