Today in Stockport, expect a grey and damp morning with rain likely, especially early on, and a high humidity of 92%. It's going to be cool, with temperatures ranging from 3 to 7 degrees Celsius. As the day goes on, the rain should ease and the clouds will break up, giving way to some sunshine in the afternoon. Morning commuters should brace for wet roads and plan for potential delays. By evening, the weather will improve, but watch for lingering moisture. Don’t forget your umbrella during the morning and dress in layers to stay warm. If you can, make the most of those clearer skies later on for any outdoor plans!
