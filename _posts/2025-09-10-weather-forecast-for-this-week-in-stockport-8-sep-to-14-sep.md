This week in Stockport will be a mix of sunshine and rain, with mild temperatures between 9°C and 19°C. Expect significant rain, especially midweek. Monday starts off partly cloudy, while Tuesday sees increased chances of rain. Wednesday is the wettest day, with an 84% chance of downpours. Thursday and Friday continue the trend with high precipitation chances, slightly cooler temps, and moderate winds. Saturday will start clear but rain is expected by afternoon, and Sunday brings breezy conditions with a solid chance of rain. Compared to the relatively dry previous period, this week marks a shift towards more typical autumn weather. Commuters should be ready for delays due to rain and wind, and those with weekend plans should aim for earlier outdoor activities on Saturday, as rain will follow later.
