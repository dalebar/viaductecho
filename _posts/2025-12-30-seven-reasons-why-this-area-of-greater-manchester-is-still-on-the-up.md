Prestwich, often dubbed the 'Didsbury of North Manchester', is a sought-after suburb known for its green spaces, diverse homes, and vibrant community. Its appeal is further enhanced by a £100M redevelopment plan that includes a new market, food hall, and homes, with the first phase underway due for completion by July 2026. Prestwich recently earned a spot in the Sunday Times' Best Places to Live, praised for its lively atmosphere, affordable housing, and easy access to Manchester.

The area boasts a variety of welcoming pubs and eateries along Bury New Road, mixing local favourites with trendy new spots. Heaton Park, a vast green space, adds to the charm, hosting major events like concerts. Property prices average around £316,927, with semi-detached homes leading the market. Despite a slight dip in prices over the past year, Prestwich continues to thrive, supported by its strong local businesses and community spirit.
