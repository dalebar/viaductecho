Royal Mail's top bosses are being summoned for urgent talks with a Government minister after Rochdale MP Paul Waugh raised concerns over severe postal delays in the area. Residents have reported mail arriving weeks late or not at all, including crucial letters for hospital appointments and bills. Waugh emphasised the stress this is causing, particularly for older residents and families relying on timely correspondence. The Government's Post Office Minister, Blair McDougall, has acknowledged the issue and scheduled a meeting with Royal Mail management to demand accountability and improvements. Waugh noted that staffing shortages are impacting service quality, despite assurances from Royal Mail about deploying more staff. A Royal Mail spokesperson expressed regret for the delays, assuring that most mail is delivered on time, and that they are actively working to resolve individual delivery issues. Waugh is committed to ensuring Rochdale gets a reliable postal service.
