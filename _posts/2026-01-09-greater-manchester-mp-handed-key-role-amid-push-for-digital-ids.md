Makerfield MP Josh Simons has nabbed a new role as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, where he’ll lead the rollout of controversial digital ID plans. The announcement follows Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's proposal to introduce mandatory digital IDs for anyone working in the UK by 2029, aimed at tackling illegal work and migration. However, the plans have sparked significant backlash, with over 2.9 million signing a petition against them due to concerns over privacy and costs. Simons reassured that the new digital ID would prioritise inclusivity, mentioning public consultations and engagement with expert groups. He also hinted at options for a physical ID alternative for those without tech access, including support through post offices for those facing challenges in proving their identity.
