Flood alerts are still active across Greater Manchester due to recent heavy rains, causing disruptions on roads and public transport, like flooding at Cornbrook tram stop and sections of the M62 and M65. The Middle River Mersey area, including Bramhall, Stockport, Sale, Altrincham, and Urmston, is particularly at risk, with warnings for low-lying land and roads around Micker and Poynton Brooks. Similarly, there’s an alert for the River Bollin catchment affecting Knutsford, Wilmslow, and Macclesfield. Residents are advised to stay updated and have flood plans ready. Weather warnings were issued for rain across Northwest England and beyond, with potential significant flooding impacts. The Environment Agency is actively working to mitigate flooding, urging caution around floodwaters, which can be deceivingly deep. For updates, folks can check the Environment Agency's social media and the flood risk checker.
