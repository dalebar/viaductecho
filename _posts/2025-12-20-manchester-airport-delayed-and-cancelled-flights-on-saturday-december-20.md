This weekend, Manchester Airport is set to buzz with thousands of passengers, gearing up for Christmas week. Friday is predicted to be the peak travel day, with nearly 500,000 people flying from UK airports. The airport expects its busiest Christmas ever, with 1.5 million passengers from December 19 to January 4. December 28 is also looking busy, with around 100,000 travellers expected. Even Christmas Day won't be quiet, featuring 85 departures and nearly 35,000 passengers, with Dubai topping the destination list. If you're flying, keep an eye on your flight status as winter weather can lead to last-minute changes. So far, there are no cancellations at Manchester Airport today, but a list of delayed flights is available, including popular routes to Singapore, Budapest, and Amsterdam. Safe travels, everyone!
