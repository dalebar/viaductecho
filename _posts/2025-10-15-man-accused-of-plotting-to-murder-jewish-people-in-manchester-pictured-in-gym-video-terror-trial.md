Bilel Saadaoui, a 36-year-old from Hindley, Wigan, is on trial for allegedly failing to inform authorities about a terror plot to attack Jewish communities in north Manchester. The jury heard that he created a workout video accompanied by a nasheed promoting Islamic State. This ties into a larger case involving his brother, Walid, and Amar Hussein, who are accused of planning a mass shooting targeting Jews in Cheetham Hill, Higher Broughton, and Prestwich. During a police raid in May 2024, Saadaoui attempted to flee, and officers found two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol, and ammunition in his car. The prosecution claims he was in the process of acquiring more firearms for the attack, while an undercover operative, Farouk, reportedly helped foil their plans. Both Walid and Amar have pleaded not guilty to the charges, and Bilel is charged with not disclosing knowledge of the terror plot. The court proceedings continue.
