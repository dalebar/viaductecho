Greater Manchester's New Year has kicked off with a chilly spell, and it's not letting up just yet. Today, January 4, is expected to be particularly cold, hitting lows of -5C, with the temperature staying below freezing until noon. A bright, crisp start will give way to increasing cloud cover, and there's a 40% chance of some snow flurries by the evening. The Met Office has put out a yellow warning for snow and ice, effective from 3pm today until midday tomorrow, impacting areas across the northwest and Wales. As everyone heads back to work and school on Monday, expect another brisk day, starting at -3C and reaching just 1C by afternoon, feeling even colder. Tuesday warms slightly to 3C but brings a chance of snow turning to rain later. Wednesday remains cold and sunny with a peak of 3C. The trend continues through the week, with mild temperatures around 5C by Thursday to Saturday but with greater chances of rain. Stay warm out there!
