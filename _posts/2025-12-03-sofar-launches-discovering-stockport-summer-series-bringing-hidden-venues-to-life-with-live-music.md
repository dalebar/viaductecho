This summer, Sofar Manchester is teaming up with Stockport BID for the Discovering Stockport Sofar Series, a three-part live music event from June to August 2025. Set in unique, local venues, the series will feature intimate performances by both grassroots and well-known artists, aiming to celebrate Stockport's rich cultural heritage while inviting the community to connect through music.

The series kicks off on 20th June in a vibrant community hub, followed by a show on 4th July at a Grade I listed landmark, and wraps up on 8th August at a venue honouring Stockport’s textile history. Each event will feature three carefully curated artists, blending local talent with global performers.

Tickets are available online, with doors opening at 7:30 PM and performances from 8:00-10:00 PM. Community engagement is a key focus, and the series is supported by Totally Stockport, ensuring that live music remains a central part of the town’s culture. Sofar is all about transforming unconventional spaces into memorable live experiences and nurturing emerging talent.
