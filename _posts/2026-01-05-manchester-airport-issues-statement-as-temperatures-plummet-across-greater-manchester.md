Greater Manchester's been hit hard with freezing temperatures and frost, prompting a Met Office snow and ice warning until noon on Monday, January 5. After a snowy night, travel disruptions are expected, particularly in the morning. The A57 Snake Pass is closed, and Liverpool John Lennon Airport is shut while crews clear snow and ice. Manchester Airport has cancelled five flights, including three to Amsterdam, due to the weather over there. They’re still operational, though, and advised passengers to plan for extra travel time due to affected roads and public transport. It’s a bit chaotic, so checking in with airlines for flight updates is a good shout. Stay safe out there!
