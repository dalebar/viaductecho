Neighbours of Jihad Al-Shamie, the man responsible for the tragic attack outside a Manchester synagogue, are in shock, feeling he lived among them unbeknownst. Al-Shamie, 35, was fatally shot by police after his attack resulted in two fatalities and several serious injuries. He was under investigation for a separate alleged crime but had never been reported to anti-terrorism authorities. Residents described him as a once-friendly neighbour who appeared to change and become "a bit strange" over the years. Some had noticed he spoke about teaching the Koran to his family. Neighbours are grappling with disbelief and fear, expressing concerns over the unexpected nature of Al-Shamie's actions. Meanwhile, his family publicly condemned the attack, expressing their shock and distress, and urged respect for their privacy during this difficult time. The community is left reeling, questioning how someone living so nearby could commit such an act of violence.
