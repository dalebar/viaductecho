Families affected by the Manchester Arena bombing are urging the government to include MI5 in new legislation aimed at preventing cover-ups in public services. They believe MI5 failed to support them after the tragedy, where false narratives were also spread by police, unfairly blaming Liverpool fans and concealing their own mistakes. The families of the five victims have reached out to the prime minister, insisting that the proposed law should ensure full transparency and accountability for MI5 and other agencies. A government spokesperson has stated that the Hillsborough Law will address these issues, promoting truth and support for those impacted.
