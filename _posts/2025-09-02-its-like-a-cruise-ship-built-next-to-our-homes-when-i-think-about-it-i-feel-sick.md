Families in Tyldesley, Wigan, are feeling overwhelmed by the looming presence of two massive warehouses, which they say are like "cruise ships" in their back gardens. The 350,000 sq ft site, set to feature four warehouses, has residents alarmed, particularly with the maximum height approved at 18.3m (60ft). Many are contemplating moving due to concerns about property values and the impact on their quality of life. Local resident John Peters expressed shock at the scale, saying it has shattered his retirement dreams. Others like Paula Boardman lament the loss of their lovely views and worry about potential structural damage to their homes. The planning process has drawn criticism for lacking adequate consultation, with residents feeling blindsided. Although Wigan Council insists the project followed proper procedures and includes landscaping to mitigate visual impact, many locals, including retired police officer Steve Retford, feel a profound sense of injustice over the development. They fear the warehouses will significantly reduce their property values and affect their living standards.
