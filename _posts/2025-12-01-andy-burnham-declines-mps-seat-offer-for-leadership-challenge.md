Andy Burnham has decided against taking up an MP’s offer to stand down, quashing speculation about him challenging Keir Starmer for Labour leader. Despite some hints of discontent with government actions, Burnham has not outright said he won’t run for Prime Minister, though he acknowledged that Labour rules require the leader to be an MP. Labour’s Clive Lewis expressed willingness to vacate his seat for Burnham’s potential bid, but Burnham has since ruled out this path, stating he won't follow Lewis to Norwich. It seems his chances of entering Parliament are dwindling as other MPs have also declined to step aside. Interestingly, Burnham’s tone seems to have shifted positively towards Starmer, showing confidence in him as leader and even praising Rachel Reeves’ recent budget moves.
