Hannah Spencer, a Green Party candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election, discusses the troubling dynamics of men in politics, highlighting how powerful figures often protect each other while feigning concern for the public. During a chilly walk with Green Party leader Zack Polanski, she draws from her background as a plumber, in stark contrast to the political scandals dominating the news this week, particularly regarding Peter Mandelson. As they campaign, Spencer emphasises the importance of giving constituents a genuine choice to improve their community. With a message of hope resonating throughout the rally, supporters are enthusiastic about the possibility of real change, contrasting with the despair felt in politics recently. Polls indicate that the Green Party is gaining momentum, with members rallying for critical issues like tackling inequality and supporting the NHS. Spencer passionately expresses her love for Manchester and its people, asserting that their spirit and resilience will not be overshadowed by negative political behaviour. As the campaign progresses, the Green Party aims to position itself as a viable alternative against the backdrop of systemic frustration with traditional parties.
