There was quite a mess at Stockport station due to a signalling fault, which Network Rail said caused major delays, leaving commuters in a bit of a pickle. With Manchester Piccadilly closed for a £7.9m upgrade, Stockport's become a busy hub, leading to overcrowded platforms and long queues for toilets. Passengers like Lawrence Mann experienced trains stacked up and confusion over platform announcements, while others, such as Jenny Flavell, complained about poor communication. Network Rail has apologised to those affected and reminded everyone to check with train operators for the latest info, especially during this chaotic Valentine’s Day weekend. They're also asking passengers to travel light and allow extra time for their journeys. Cheers for your patience!
