This weekend, the UK's in for a bit of a washout with heavy rain on the horizon. Greater Manchester's stuck in a bit of anticyclonic gloom today and Saturday morning, but there's a glimmer of sunshine expected Saturday afternoon. However, Sunday looks grim, with spells of heavy rain rolling in early and lasting throughout the day. The Met Office has actually put out a 12-hour yellow warning for heavy rain in parts of Northern Ireland, including Belfast and Newry, but Greater Manchester will still face its share of wet weather. Temps will sit around 13°C today, with a slight lift to 14°C on Saturday afternoon before things take a soggy turn on Sunday morning, starting with light rain in Wigan. Expect heavy rain mid-morning to early afternoon, easing off later in the day, with highs around 15°C. So, keep your brolly handy!
