Stockroom, Stockport's new library and events space, has welcomed a whopping 250,000 visitors since opening in May. The summer has been a hit, with 20,000 books borrowed and 15,000 coffees enjoyed—plus, it even hosted its first birth registration. Imagine that as 190 sold-out shows at The Plaza or three Oasis gigs at Heaton Park! The open-plan venue features various social and study areas, accessible from both the Merseyway high street and Great Underbank. Downstairs, there's a café, events space, fiction section, and a children's zone, while the upper floor houses non-fiction, archives, and another events area. Stockport Council is chuffed, saying Stockroom has revitalised previously idle retail units and enhanced the Merseyway vibe. Cllr Dan Oliver commented on the warm reception, highlighting that Stockroom is a space for everyone, and this is just the start.
