Bradford Bulls have been promoted to Super League for 2026, taking the spot of Salford Red Devils, who earned the top Grade B status. Salford struggled in 2025, losing most of their first-team players and relying on youth prospects, which led to a staggering 1,129 points conceded over 27 games, averaging 41.8 points against. 

Meanwhile, Hull KR have topped the 2025 rankings with a score of 17.85 out of 20, the highest since the grading system began in 2023. Clubs were evaluated on five criteria—fandom, performance, finances, stadium, and community—with a total of 20 points available.
