Chad James, a drug dealer, was arrested in February 2023 at Manchester Airport while trying to fly to Zurich. Following an investigation linked to the Encrochat encryption, he faced various charges, including conspiracy to supply drugs and money laundering, leading to a 16-year sentence in August 2023. However, he continued his drug operation from behind bars, working with associate Mark McGovern, who managed drug couriers. Recently, both were sentenced along with other gang members, adding more than 100 years in total between them. James received an additional 4 years and 11 months. Detective Chief Inspector Tom Edmondson highlighted the seriousness of the organised crime issue and urged the public to report any related suspicions. Other gang members also received varying sentences for their roles in supplying drugs.
