This weekend (November 28-30), five sections of Greater Manchester's motorways will be closed, coinciding with a packed schedule of events in the city. Co-op Live and the AO Arena are hosting sold-out shows, and Manchester City plays Leeds on Saturday. However, the biggest crowd will likely be at the Christmas Markets and the Black Friday sales. Last weekend saw 1.2 million journeys in the city, leading Transport for Greater Manchester to advise everyone—Mancs and visitors alike—to plan ahead and use public transport where possible. They've set up four pop-up park and ride locations offering 1,000 free parking spots. For those who need to drive, it's recommended to adjust travel times or routes to avoid congested areas. Keep in mind the overnight closures of the M56, M60, M61, M66, and M67.
