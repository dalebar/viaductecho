Detectives in Bolton are continuing their murder investigation after a woman was found dead in a flat on Kempton Gardens. Emergency services were called on January 19 when concerns for her welfare were raised, but sadly, she could not be saved. A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and investigators have since been granted more time to question him. Forensic teams were extensively working at the scene, with a police cordon in place to secure the area. Greater Manchester Police are focused on identifying the victim and informing her next of kin, reassuring the public that there’s no wider threat. Detective Inspector Louise Kelly emphasised their priority is to support the victim's family and gather more information about the incident. They encourage anyone with relevant information to reach out to them or to Crimestoppers for anonymity.
