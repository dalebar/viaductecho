Andy Burnham has dismissed claims that he knew his bid to become MP for Gorton and Denton would be blocked, suggesting it was an attempt to undermine Keir Starmer. ITV's Robert Peston reported that sources close to the Prime Minister alleged Burnham was warned that his request to the Labour NEC would be rejected, interpreting his application as a means to create dissent within the party. Burnham retorted, "This is simply untrue." Meanwhile, senior Labour members have expressed frustration, calling the situation a “remote stitch-up” by a select few in the party’s leadership. Campaigning for the by-election is now in full swing, with activists spotted in the area. However, Lee Anderson, a senior Reform MP, faced backlash for campaigning outside an area that isn’t actually part of Gorton or Denton, but in the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency.
