A head-on crash in Bolton has left two women and three men in hospital, while three teenagers and a 54-year-old taxi driver tragically lost their lives. The deceased teenagers have been named as Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, Farhan Patel, and Mohammed Danyaal, who were in a red Seat Leon. The taxi driver, Masrob Ali, was remembered by his family as a kind soul who had been a cabbie for about a decade. The crash, which occurred just after midnight on January 11, is under investigation, with police focusing on footage showing a driver reaching speeds over 120mph shortly before the incident. Authorities are urging caution in sharing videos on social media. Five passengers remain in hospital, with one woman in critical condition, as the investigation progresses. Police are calling for witnesses and reminding anyone with dashcam footage to come forward. The community is rallying around those affected, as first responders manage the aftermath of the devastating event.
