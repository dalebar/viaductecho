Tracey Neville, former England netball player and head coach, has been appointed managing director of Stockport County's new women's football team. Having represented England 81 times and achieved considerable success with the national team, she’s now set to lead the next phase of development for the club. Neville expresses pride in joining during such a transformative time for both the club and women's football, aiming to create pathways for local girls to reach the top without leaving their community. Stockport County Ladies, which started as a voluntary group in 1989, is being formalised ahead of the 2026-27 season. The club's CEO, Simon Wilson, emphasised the importance of their history and the ambition to provide equal opportunities for women’s football, mirroring the men’s support. Exciting plans are underway to celebrate the women's team's launch, honouring past and present contributors to the sport in the area.
