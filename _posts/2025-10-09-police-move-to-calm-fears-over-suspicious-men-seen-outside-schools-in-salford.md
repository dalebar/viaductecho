Police in Salford have reassured parents about 'suspicious' men spotted near schools, stating these individuals were actually contractors working nearby. GMP Salford confirmed they've investigated reports causing concern and clarified that the increase of activity outside schools is linked to the 'Beat the Street' app, which encourages local walking, running, and cycling. They urged the community to remain calm and report genuine worries, as there’s no immediate threat to schools. Any social media chatter, while sometimes helpful, can also spread fear, so it’s best to stay grounded.
