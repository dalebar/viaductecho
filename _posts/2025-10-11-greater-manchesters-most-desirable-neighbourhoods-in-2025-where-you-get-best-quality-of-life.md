This corridor includes areas like Ancoats and Deansgate, extending to Altrincham, Didsbury, and Bramhall. The Liveable Score analyses local factors such as home ownership and education to determine desirability. The report shows these neighbourhoods have higher house prices due to their appeal. 

Key areas include:
- Altrincham (£587,672, B+) 
- Ancoats (£381,354, A)
