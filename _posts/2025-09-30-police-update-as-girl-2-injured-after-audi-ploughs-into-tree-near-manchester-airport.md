A two-year-old girl was rushed to the hospital after a crash near Manchester Airport last Wednesday, involving a grey Audi Q3 that left the road and hit a tree on Broadoak Lane, Mobberley. The 28-year-old driver from Altrincham was arrested for causing serious injury by dangerous driving but has since been released on bail. Both were taken to Wythenshawe Hospital post-accident, with the child suffering injuries to her head and arm, later transferred to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. The driver had non-life-changing arm injuries. Cheshire Police are investigating the incident and urge anyone with information or relevant dashcam/CCTV footage to get in touch by calling 101 and quoting incident number IML 2182131.
