A black and white cat tragically died after being zipped up in a rucksack and abandoned in Reddish Vale Park. Discovered on 23 December 2025, the poor cat was severely hypothermic and in dire need of care. Despite being rushed to the vet, she couldn't be saved. Francesca Iraci from the RSPCA expressed the heartache of finding the cat abandoned at such a cold time when others were with family. The RSPCA is appealing for information to identify who left the cat in such a cruel situation. Anyone with details is urged to contact them at 0300 123 8018, referencing incident number 01702394.
