The Northern Lights Lantern Parade is back in Tameside, kicking off the festive fun in Stalybridge on November 15. This free event promises a dazzling night of lantern displays and lively performances, attracting thousands of families each year. Originally intended for Ashton, it’s shifted locations due to ongoing regeneration works. This year’s celebrations also feature local talent and the Stalybridge Street Fest on Saturday. To join in, locals can attend lantern-making workshops at Stalybridge Civic Hall during the October half term. The evening will culminate with the Christmas tree lights being switched on. Additionally, each of Tameside's nine towns will host their own festive events throughout November and early December, complete with music, food, and community spirit. Councillor Leanne Feeley expressed excitement about the parade, inviting everyone to participate and enjoy this vibrant celebration that showcases Tameside’s cultural essence.
