Stockport Council's local plan has come under fire from the government for not making enough progress. The council had a draft plan ready last year but postponed it due to new housing targets set by the government. The council, led by the Lib Dems and without overall control, hasn’t adopted a local plan since 2011, having previously withdrawn from a Greater Manchester plan over green belt concerns. Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook has pushed the council to consult on its plan by December 24 and have it ready for inspection by November 30, 2026. He expressed frustration at the lack of progress compared to other Greater Manchester councils. Mark Roberts, the council leader, defended their efforts, saying the government’s changes complicate their plans and threaten local green spaces. Meanwhile, homelessness is rising in Stockport, with around 9,000 households on the social housing register. Local MPs and councillors from both Labour and Conservative parties welcomed the government intervention, stressing the need for a clear growth plan to protect residents and the green belt. The council insisted they're committed to moving forward with their local plan despite the setbacks.
