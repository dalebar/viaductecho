A freight train derailed in Audenshaw, Greater Manchester, on September 6, 2024, when nine of its 24 wagons came off the rails due to failed screws during an inspection. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, but it did cause significant disruption, closing the railway for about eight weeks. An investigation by the Rail Accidents Investigation Branch (RAIB) found that the screws, critical for maintaining the track gauge, were damaged and went undetected by Network Rail’s inspection methods. The report criticises Network Rail for poor record-keeping regarding previous failures and highlights a systemic failure in managing the longitudinal bearer system used on the bridge. The RAIB made eight recommendations for improvement, including better record management and inspection processes. Network Rail has accepted these findings and has reportedly enhanced its inspection and maintenance practices across the region to prevent future issues.
