Strike action by around 1,000 Metroline Manchester workers is set to begin tomorrow, following failed talks over pay. The strike, involving members of Unite the Union, will impact services from four depots: Sharston, Hyde Road, Ashton, and Wythenshawe, causing significant disruption. While some services are still running normally, the dispute centres on workers demanding fair pay to address years of low wages at the profitable firm.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed frustration with Metroline prioritising profits over workersâ€™ needs. Metroline, on the other hand, expressed disappointment, stating they've offered an 8.8% pay rise over two years. Strikes at Stagecoach and First Bus Rochdale have been partly suspended after new pay offers emerged, allowing those workers to vote on their proposals.

Future coordinated strikes across all three companies could occur, with potential dates in October still under consideration. Metroline aims to resolve the situation and avoid further disruption, urging drivers to consider their improved offer.
