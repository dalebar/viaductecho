Manchester Airport is gearing up for its busiest October half-term ever, expecting over a million passengers. Popular destinations include Dublin, Amsterdam, Alicante, Dubai, Antalya, Tenerife, and Malaga. Passengers are urged to check for any Terminal changes, as many may now be flying from the new, £1.3bn Terminal 2, especially with ongoing improvements to Terminal 3. Ryanair customers will see a slight alteration in their journey from October 21, as they'll start using the Terminal 1 Departures A for check-in and security, before heading to Terminal 3’s lounge. Clear signage and staff assistance will be available. Airport Customer Operations Director Jennifer Byrne-Smith expressed excitement about welcoming travellers and highlighted the nearing completion of the transformation programme. Additionally, the airport recently opened new routes to Islamabad and Delhi, expanding options for travellers heading to India. With new facilities, including an accessible lounge in Terminal 2, it’s an exciting time at Manchester Airport, ensuring a smooth experience for all passengers over the holiday period.
