Ricky Hatton’s funeral on October 10 was a grand tribute to the boxing star who passed away at 46. Thousands gathered in Manchester, applauding and cheering as his cortege processed through his hometown, past familiar pubs and gyms. A flat-bed truck featured his cherished yellow Reliant Regal, with mourners dressed in black and blue showing their affection through heartfelt floral tributes, including a pint of Guinness-shaped wreath.

As the procession approached Manchester Cathedral, crowds shouted “There’s only one Ricky Hatton,” reflecting their deep love for the local hero. Celebrities like Tyson Fury and Liam Gallagher added to the star-studded turnout. Inside the cathedral, emotional tributes by Hatton’s children hit home, while fans outside listened in silence, celebrating his legacy.

The day ended at the Etihad Stadium with more tributes, showcasing the community spirit of Manchester. Fans shared memories of Hatton's down-to-earth nature and his impact on their lives, making it clear he wasn’t just a champion in the ring, but a true man of the people—a fitting farewell for a beloved Mancunian legend.
