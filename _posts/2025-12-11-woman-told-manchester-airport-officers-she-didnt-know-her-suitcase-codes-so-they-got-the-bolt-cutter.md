Shannon Gandy-Feeney, a 24-year-old woman, was sentenced to a year and eight months in prison for attempting to smuggle nearly 30kg of cannabis through Manchester Airport. Stopped by Border Force after returning from a 10-day trip to Thailand, she wept in court as the judge highlighted the weight of her suitcases and the significant risk she took. Gandy-Feeney claimed she was unaware of the suitcase contents and had been in a desperate situation, facing drug debts. While defending her, her barrister noted her troubled background, struggles with alcohol, and mental health issues. Despite acknowledging her mistake, the judge emphasised the severity of her actions and the importance of seizing the opportunity for rehabilitation while in prison. Gandy-Feeney was reminded that she could build a better future upon her release if she addresses her challenges.
