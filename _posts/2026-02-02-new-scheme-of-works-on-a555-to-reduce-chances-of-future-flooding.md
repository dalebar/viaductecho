Works are kicking off on the A555 to tackle frequent flooding issues that have plagued the route connecting Cheshire, Stockport, and Manchester. Councillor Jake Austin shared that improvements will start on February 2, particularly near Woodford recreation ground, where a new water-collecting basin will be installed. This should help prevent water from pouring onto the road during heavy rain. Previous incidents, like last year's closure due to Storm Claudia and severe flooding in early 2025, highlighted the urgency of these upgrades. The council also plans further enhancements to the drainage systems, including addressing problems with attenuation ponds and overwhelmed pumps. Overall, these efforts aim to significantly reduce flooding troubles on the A555 and ease the burden for residents and road users.
