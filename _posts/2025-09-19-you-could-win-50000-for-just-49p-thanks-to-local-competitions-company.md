High Peak Comps is buzzing this September with some cracking prize draws! You can grab a chance to win £50,000 for just 49p per ticket, with the draw closing on Sunday, 28 September. There's also an instant win contest featuring a whopping £150,000 prize pot, with over 11,000 prizes, including cash and gadgets like PS5s and Dyson Air Wraps. They’ve had loads of winners already, and if you don’t scoop a prize, you’re still in the running for a £10,000 grand draw on 24 September.

High Peak Comps is all about giving back too—they’ve supported local causes like Future Directions and the Bridgend Centre. Established in March 2020, they’ve already given away an amazing £10m in prizes. Plus, they’ve recently welcomed Lewis to their team for some added fun! So, if you fancy a flutter or want to support local projects, check them out on Facebook and grab your tickets!
