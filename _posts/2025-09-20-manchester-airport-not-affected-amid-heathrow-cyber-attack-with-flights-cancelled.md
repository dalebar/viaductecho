Flights at Heathrow and several other European airports have been delayed or cancelled due to a cyber attack affecting Collins Aerospace, a service provider for check-in and boarding systems. Fortunately, Manchester Airport is operating normally and hasnâ€™t been impacted. Passengers flying from affected airports, including Brussels and Berlin, are advised to check their flight status before heading to the airport, and to expect longer waiting times due to manual check-in processes. Collins Aerospace is currently working to resolve the issue. Both Heathrow and Brussels airports have urged travellers to avoid arriving too early and to only travel if their flights are confirmed. Stay updated through local news sources or airport announcements!
