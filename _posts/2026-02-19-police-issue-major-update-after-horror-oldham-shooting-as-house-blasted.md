Police have issued an update following a shooting in Oldham that occurred on February 15, when gunfire hit a house on School House Road. Initially, officers were called about criminal damage and later discovered multiple bullet holes in the front window. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and the incident is believed to be a targeted attack. Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the shooting but have since been released on bail while investigations continue. Police are carrying out extra patrols in the area to reassure residents and are keen to gather more information. They are appealing for witnesses or anyone with CCTV or dash cam footage from the time of the shooting to come forward.
