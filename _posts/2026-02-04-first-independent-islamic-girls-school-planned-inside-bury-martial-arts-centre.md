Plans are in the works to transform the vacant ground floor of a martial arts centre in Bury into the town's first independent Islamic girls' school, pending council approval. The proposed school at Khizra House on Lord Street aims to serve the large local Muslim community, which currently sends daughters up to nine miles away for education. Bury Academy proposes classrooms for around 100 students, positioned conveniently by Jamia Khizra Mosque. Operating hours would be 8am to 3.15pm on weekdays and 8am to 12.15pm on Fridays, catering for years seven to eleven. With no existing Muslim girls' school locally, the new establishment hopes to ease travel woes for families. The plans include using nearby Openshaw Park for outdoor activities and creating a flexible playground that turns into a car park after hours. Following community feedback, the planned student intake has been reduced to mitigate traffic concerns. Bury Defence Academy will maintain its martial arts classes during evenings and weekends, ensuring continued community engagement.
