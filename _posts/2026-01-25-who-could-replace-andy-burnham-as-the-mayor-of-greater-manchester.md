There’s a buzz around the upcoming Greater Manchester mayoral race, especially with Andy Burnham stepping down to return to Parliament. The Labour Party is keen to maintain its stronghold, and various names are swirling around as potential successors. Notably, Gary Neville, a Manchester icon and ex-United captain, has been mentioned, alongside seasoned Labour figures like Salford's Paul Dennett, Bev Craig from Manchester City Council, and Bury’s Eamonn O'Brien. The new mayor will lead the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, managing a notable budget of around £2.6m. While the exact election date remains uncertain, candidates must be at least 18, live or work in the area for 12 months prior to nomination, and be on the electoral register. Political newcomers or insiders could potentially shake things up, reflecting the unpredictable nature of politics. The last election saw Burnham re-elected with a significant majority, but as always, surprises are part of the game.
