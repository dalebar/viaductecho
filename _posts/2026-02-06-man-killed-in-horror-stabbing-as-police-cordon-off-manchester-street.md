A murder investigation is underway in Wythenshawe following the tragic death of Drew McCormick, a man in his 20s who was found seriously injured on Southwick Road and sadly died at the scene. This incident, believed to be a fatal stabbing, occurred late last night, and a 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in police custody.

Forensic officers are on-site, gathering evidence and a cordon is in place as investigations continue. Residents have expressed shock, noting that nothing like this typically happens in their area. Friends have fondly described Drew as a "funny, loving, caring young man" who was the "life and soul of the party." Police are urging anyone with information to reach out via their non-emergency number or anonymously through Crimestoppers.
