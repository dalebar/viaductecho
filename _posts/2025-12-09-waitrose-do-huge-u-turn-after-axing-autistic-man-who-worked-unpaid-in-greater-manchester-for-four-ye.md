Tom Boyd, a 28-year-old with autism, has landed a paid job with Waitrose after a controversial dismissal sparked a public outcry. For four years, he volunteered at a Cheadle Hulme store, but was initially denied paid work, leading his mother, Frances, to speak out about the supermarket’s dismissive response. Following media attention and growing public support, Tom received a job offer from Asda before Waitrose reversed its decision, ultimately deciding to employ him. He’ll start in January, avoiding the busy Christmas period. A Waitrose spokesperson expressed delight at the decision, ensuring that they’re learning from this situation and working to improve opportunities for neurodiverse individuals. The case even gained national attention in parliament, highlighting the importance of disabled individuals in the workforce and the need for improved support and opportunities.
