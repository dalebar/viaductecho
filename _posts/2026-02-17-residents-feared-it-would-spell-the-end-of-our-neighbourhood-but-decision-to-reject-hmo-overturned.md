Plans to transform a three-bedroom home on Begonia Avenue, Farnworth, into a four-bed shared house, initially turned down by Bolton's planning committee, have been approved following an appeal. Last October, the committee had worried that the change would disrupt the family-friendly character of the neighbourhood, citing concerns over space and potential overcrowding. Local councillors and residents expressed strong objections, claiming it would harm the community vibe. However, the Planning Inspectorate's report found no significant evidence of overcrowding or negative impacts from the conversion. The inspector acknowledged the residents' worries but deemed them largely speculative, stating that concerns about noise, anti-social behaviour, and neighbourhood character weren't backed by solid proof. The approval has sparked mixed feelings among community members, reflecting the ongoing debate over shared housing in family areas.
