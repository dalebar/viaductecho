Today in Stockport, expect partly cloudy skies with a mild day ahead. Temperatures will range from a cool 9°C in the morning to a pleasant 14°C by the afternoon. The high humidity at 86% might feel a bit damp, but thankfully, there's no chance of rain, so you can leave the brolly at home. A gentle breeze at 9 mph will keep things comfortable. 

It’s a great day for walking or cycling, with smooth commuting likely since it’s dry out there. Just dress in layers to stay comfy as the temps shift throughout the day – you might want to throw on some sunglasses for those fleeting sunny breaks. Enjoy the day!
