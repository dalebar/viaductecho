Aer Lingus has announced it will completely halt its transatlantic flights from Manchester by the end of March, specifically cutting routes to New York, Orlando, and Barbados. The New York service ends on February 23, while the others will follow suit by March 31. They plan to run a Dublin to Barbados flight in April and May to help affected customers. However, short-haul flights between Manchester and Ireland will remain unaffected. The airline is reaching out to impacted customers about their options for refunds and rebooking. Manchester Airport reassured passengers that similar routes are available with other carriers, maintaining overall connectivity for Northern travellers. The closure follows ongoing challenges at the Manchester base, which has led to consultations about job impacts for around 200 staff. Despite this shift, Aer Lingus will continue a strong presence in Manchester through its short-haul network.
