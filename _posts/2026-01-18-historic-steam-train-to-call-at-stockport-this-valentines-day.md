Stockport's in for a treat this Valentine’s Day with the steam train experience! On Saturday, 14 February, the Valentine's Stratford Flyer will roll out from Manchester Victoria, making stops at Stockport, Macclesfield, and Stoke, before heading to Stratford-upon-Avon. The journey, pulled by a vintage locomotive, echoes the romantic vibes of yesteryear, like in "Brief Encounter." The train sets off early at 7.30am, reaching Stockport by about 8.45am, then onwards to Macclesfield at 9am. Once in Stratford, there's plenty of time to explore, check out Shakespeare's birthplace, and enjoy the town’s shops and eateries before heading back at 12.50pm. The return trip wraps up in Stockport around 8.45pm and Manchester Victoria by 9.40pm. Tickets kick off at £115 for standard class and £329 for premier, which comes with a full English breakfast and a lovely four-course dinner. A lovely day out awaits!
