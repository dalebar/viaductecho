An 80-year-old man was arrested in Worsley after a 95-year-old woman was threatened and tied up during an attempted robbery at her home in Little Hulton. The suspect, who approached the elderly woman under the guise of asking about bin collection, demanded cash and her purse. He was interrupted by another woman who knew the victim, prompting him to flee. Thankfully, no injuries occurred, and the victim is receiving support from the police. Det Insp Paul Davies expressed shock at the incident and reassured the community that they have a suspect in custody while investigations continue. He urged everyone to refrain from speculation as the case unfolds.
