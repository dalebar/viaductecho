Prestwich is gearing up for a £100m transformation of its town centre, with community input now being sought on updated plans for the Longfield Centre. The partnership of Muse and Bury Council, called Your Prestwich, has unveiled more details ahead of a formal planning application, bolstered by a £6.7m boost from the Greater Manchester Good Growth Fund. While some work, like the £14m travel hub, is already underway, businesses have been told to leave the old shopping centre by early April, with demolition set for March 13. The revamped area will include a new town square, library, retail spaces, and up to 250 homes, up from the original 200, along with a gym and green spaces. Adjustments to the buildings aim to enhance sunlight in the public areas. Locals can share their thoughts through an online survey until February 25 or join drop-in sessions on February 12 and 15 to discuss the plans with the project team, marking the final call for feedback before plans head to town planners.
