A by-election will be held in the Hale ward of Trafford on Thursday, November 20, following the resignation of Green Party councillor Coun Owain Sutton. He stepped down due to health issues, mentioning he felt it was time to pass on the responsibility for representing residents. Sutton expressed pride in his and his fellow councillors’ achievements but believed a fresh voice would better serve the community. Trafford’s returning officer stressed the importance of residents voting, encouraging everyone to register by the deadline of Tuesday, November 4. Voters will need to show photo ID at polling stations, and those lacking it can apply for a Voter Authority Certificate. This will be Trafford’s second by-election this year, after the Conservatives gained a seat in Broadheath. Currently, Labour holds the majority with 41 councillors, followed by the Conservatives (9), Liberal Democrats (7), and Greens (5).
