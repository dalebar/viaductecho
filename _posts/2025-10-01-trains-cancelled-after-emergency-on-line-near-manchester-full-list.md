There's been a right kerfuffle with train services near Manchester today, as dozens have been cancelled or delayed due to an emergency incident. Northern, TransPennine Express, and Transport for Wales services are all feeling the pinch, especially around the Patricroft area in Salford. Emergency services have closed all lines between Newton-le-Willows and both Manchester Victoria and Oxford Road, causing delays of up to 45 minutes and disruptions likely to last until around 10am. A spokesperson from National Rail confirmed the closures, and they're still awaiting further details about the incident. Keep an eye out for updated information on cancellations at key stations like Manchester Victoria, Oxford Road, Piccadilly, and Newton-le-Willows throughout the morning.
