New Year's Eve in Greater Manchester was marred by violence as a man in his 20s was fatally stabbed in Bury just before midnight. Police arrived to find him injured, but despite efforts to save him, he was pronounced dead. Two individuals, a man and woman both in their 20s, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, with a thorough investigation ongoing. Meanwhile, in Middleton early on New Year’s Day, an altercation stemming from a pub argument left three others injured, prompting further police involvement and the arrest of a man in his 30s on assault charges. Residents expressed shock at the violence, contrasting it with typical New Year's celebrations. GMP is urging witnesses to come forward to aid both investigations, with contact details provided for tips.
