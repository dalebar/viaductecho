Bus strikes in Greater Manchester scheduled for this week have mostly been suspended, as announced by Bee Network bosses. Over 2,000 bus workers from Stagecoach, Metroline, and First Bus Rochdale were set to strike over pay from September 30 to October 2, following a previous four-day strike. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) revealed that the union has paused the strikes while members consider a new pay offer. A decision from Metroline staff is expected soon, with hopes they will follow suit. Most bus services will run normally, but passengers should check before travelling. The latest offer follows intense negotiations, with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham expressing support for better deals for drivers while ensuring sustainability for the network. Earlier, unions had rejected pay offers that were deemed insufficient amid rising living costs. The situation remains dynamic, and updates on services will be available via the Bee Networkâ€™s channels.
