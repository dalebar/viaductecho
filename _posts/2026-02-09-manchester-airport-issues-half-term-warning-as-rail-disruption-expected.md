Manchester Airport is advising passengers to plan ahead for February half term as Manchester Piccadilly station will be closed for nine days, from 14-22 February, due to Network Rail upgrades. With nearly one million expected to travel, there will be no direct train services to the airport during this time; buses will replace train services, running from Piccadilly. Passengers flying should note recent changes, with most airlines now operating from Terminal 2 after a £1.3 billion transformation, while Terminal 1 is mostly closed. 

New security scanners mean you won’t have to remove liquids or electronics from bags, though 100ml restrictions still apply. Drop-off fees apply at the terminal, and passengers are encouraged to arrive early and check hand luggage rules. The Great Northern Market, featuring diverse food offerings, has recently opened in Terminal 2. Airport officials emphasise smart packing and using night-before bag drop services to ease the travel experience. Ultimately, the airport aims to complete enhancements by summer, ensuring a smooth journey for its passengers.
