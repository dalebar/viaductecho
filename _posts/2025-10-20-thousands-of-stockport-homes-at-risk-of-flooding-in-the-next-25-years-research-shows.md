New research from Aviva warns that thousands of homes in Stockport could face flooding risks in the next 25 years unless action is taken. Their Building Future Communities report highlights that by 2050, properties at risk from climate threats like flooding and extreme heat could surge, with estimates suggesting up to 6.1 million homes in England could be affected by 2060. Urban areas like Manchester are particularly vulnerable due to increased hard surfaces hindering rainwater drainage. The report breaks down flooding risk figures for specific areas: Cheadle could see 24.9% of properties at risk by 2050 (up from 19.4% in 2025), Hazel Grove could rise to 19.4% (from 14.7%), and Stockport could increase to 18.8% (from 14.2%). Aviva's CEO emphasised the urgency of adapting to these changing climate conditions, pointing out that the report underscores the potentially serious impacts on homes and businesses in the coming years.
