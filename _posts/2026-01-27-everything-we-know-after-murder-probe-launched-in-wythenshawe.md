A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman in her 30s was found dead at a house on Lulworth Gardens in Wythenshawe. Police responded to a disturbance call around 8:30am, and despite CPR efforts from officers and paramedics, she was pronounced dead at the scene. A forensics tent has been erected, and the area remains cordoned off as investigations are ongoing. Greater Manchester Police assure the public there's no wider threat, and they're working hard to uncover the details surrounding this tragic incident. Specialist officers are supporting the victim’s family, and the police are asking anyone with information to contact them via 101, GMP LiveChat, or Crimestoppers, referencing log 516 of January 27.
