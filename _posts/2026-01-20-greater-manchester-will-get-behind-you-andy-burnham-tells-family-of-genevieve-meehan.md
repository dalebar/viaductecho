Greater Manchester is rolling out changes in nurseries after the tragic death of nine-month-old Genevieve ‘Gigi’ Meehan at Tiny Toes Children’s Day Nursery. The nursery worker responsible has been sentenced to 14 years. Gigi's parents are advocating for better safety standards through their Campaign for Gigi, which calls for mandatory CCTV in nurseries, routine unannounced Ofsted inspections, statutory safe sleep guidelines, and required training for nursery staff. 

Recently, they delivered a letter to Downing Street with their MP, urging the Government to act swiftly to prevent similar tragedies. Over 50 MPs attended an event where they discussed the campaign's goals. Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, also expressed his support, stating that Greater Manchester will trial the proposed changes, which focus on training and safety measures to set a standard for the country.

The campaign aims to ensure that all parents can trust their children's early years settings, as Gigi’s family seeks swift action from the government for the safety and welfare of children. The Manchester Evening News is backing the campaign and encouraging public engagement.
