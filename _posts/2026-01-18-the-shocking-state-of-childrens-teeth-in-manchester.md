New figures paint a bleak picture of children's oral health in Manchester, revealing that 60.8% of five-year-olds suffer from dental decay, one of the highest rates in England. The situation among three-year-olds is equally worrying, with over 20% experiencing decay, nearly double the national rate. The cost of hospital admissions for tooth extractions in under-19s reaches an estimated £81 million. Alarmingly, nearly a third of adults in Manchester also have active dental decay, with many older individuals not visiting the dentist for over two years. Tooth extraction episodes in young people have soared by 61% compared to the national rate, yet the number of NHS dentists in the city has significantly declined. 

Currently, 434 children are waiting for general anaesthetic for dental procedures, with some waiting over a year. The report highlights ongoing access issues to dental care and health inequalities, with families struggling to afford necessary treatments. As one local dentist noted, many people, especially the “working poor,” often face the harrowing choice between dental care and basic necessities like food. The message is clear: improving oral health services in Manchester is urgently needed.
