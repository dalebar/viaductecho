In December 2025 and January 2026, twenty local eateries and shops received five-star food hygiene ratings from the Food Standards Agency. This rating signifies that their hygiene standards are 'very good' and meet legal requirements. To achieve this top rating, businesses must excel in food handling, physical conditions, and food safety management. If a business doesn't get a five-star rating, the inspector provides guidance on necessary improvements. 

The list of these acclaimed businesses includes Cure Bistro, Eden, First Stop Community Cafe, Grynd, and several others, mostly found in Heaton Moor, Brinnington, and Stockport town centre. Local councils determine inspection frequencies based on potential public health risks.  

Be sure to check out these eateries and their stellar hygiene ratings!
