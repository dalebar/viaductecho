Jet2 has just announced three exciting new routes from Manchester Airport, set to kick off in summer 2026. They’re adding flights to two lovely spots in Greece—Olympus Riviera, known for its stunning mountains and coast, and Meganisi, famed for turquoise waters. Plus, they’re introducing Palermo in Sicily as a fresh city break option. 

Steve Heapy, the CEO, mentioned that these additions are a direct response to the growing demand for Greek and Italian holidays, giving folks in the North West more choice for sunny escapes. For the Olympus Riviera, they’ll offer five resorts and flights from Thessaloniki Airport on Tuesdays and Saturdays, while Meganisi will be accessible via Preveza Airport on Wednesdays and Sundays, with an extra Saturday service too. 

As for Palermo, weekly flights will run on Tuesdays and Fridays. It sounds like a fab summer ahead for those looking to soak up some sun or explore historic cities!
