This weekend in Stockport is packed with events, thanks to sponsors EatGoodWest UK, Worker Bee Markets, and Waterside Hotel & Leisure Club. Catch the festive pantomime "Aladdin" at Stockport Plaza from December 5th to January 4th, featuring Coronation Street’s Brian Capron as the villain Abanazar. 

For music lovers, The Spinning Top has a lively lineup: free entry on Friday with performances from The Local and others; a pop-punk tribute night on Saturday for £6 in advance; and a Jelly Roll Blues Jam on Sunday from 4-7 PM, free for all musicians. 

Additionally, don’t miss the guided factory floor tour at the Stockport Hat Museum on Saturday at 2 PM, exploring the town's rich hatting history for £8.50 (or £7 concessions). 

Be sure to check out the “What’s On” section for more happenings, and if you’ve got an event, submit it! Subscribe to the Stockport Nub News newsletter for the latest updates!
