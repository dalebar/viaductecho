Last night in south Manchester, a protest on Wilmslow Road, known as the Curry Mile, turned chaotic around 9pm. While the demonstration began peacefully, things escalated with a large group damaging property and vehicles, and throwing items at police. The protest was related to the conflict between Syrian government troops and Kurdish forces. Greater Manchester Police responded with a dispersal order, allowing them to clear the area, which they did by around 10pm. Though some cars and properties were damaged, no arrests were made. GMP is reviewing CCTV footage to investigate the disorder and has called for anyone with information to come forward. Superintendent Stephen Wiggins stressed the police's commitment to facilitating peaceful protests but also to taking action against disorderly behaviour.
