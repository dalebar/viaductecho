Seven children in a Stockport home faced shocking neglect, living in dreadful conditions with no food, water, or heating, and surrounded by human waste. A safeguarding report revealed that social services had been aware of the family's situation for about a decade. The awful state of the home was discovered during a police visit following serious allegations of sexual abuse against a teenager in the family. Officers reported it as the worst they had seen in years. Social workers previously noted the family's neglect but were met with little improvement despite intervention. The children's needs often went unmet, with reports of them arriving at school dirty and hungry. The parents admitted to struggles, including mental health issues and hoarding. The review has prompted Stockport social services to implement seven recommendations for better handling of similar cases in the future. An Ofsted inspection earlier this year highlighted ongoing concerns in the children's services, with a commitment from the council to improve. The situation has sparked serious reflection and a push for significant change within the system.
