Manchester council is kicking off 2026 with a pleasant surprise—23% more funding than expected. Thanks to government changes in grants, the council has gone from facing a £19 million deficit to having a £14 million surplus. Authorities have long pointed out how hard-hit Manchester was by austerity since 2010, claiming it could have been £60 million better off annually if just average cuts were applied. With new reforms, Manchester will actually be above average by 2027, allowing officials to focus on rebuilding front-line services. Rabnawaz Akbar, the executive councillor for finance, expressed optimism about restoring hope and improving neighbourhoods with this extra money, although he reassured residents that spending will be thoughtfully managed. Funding could go towards gully cleaning, park maintenance, and addressing issues with rogue landlords. While there's a rise in council tax of nearly 5% expected in April, this is seen as a necessary move to maintain financial stability. Overall, the council aims to effectively invest and enhance services for the community.
