Bolton's innovative mobile job centre scheme is set to expand, having already helped nearly 800 people since its launch last January. Located at community hubs like Bolton Wanderers’ stadium and local mosques, the service targets areas with high unemployment, like Bolton, which has a notably high employment inactivity rate of 29.2%. Many users are accessing job support for the first time, and over half are not on benefits. 

Work and pensions secretary Pat McFadden recently praised the initiative for effectively reaching economically inactive individuals who might avoid traditional job centres. The mobile service will now extend to nine areas across England, Scotland, and Wales, including places like Blackpool and Wakefield, tripling its fleet. The vans bring DWP work coaches directly to communities, offering help with job searches, training, and information on childcare and disability support. McFadden emphasised the aim to break down barriers to employment by making support more accessible.
