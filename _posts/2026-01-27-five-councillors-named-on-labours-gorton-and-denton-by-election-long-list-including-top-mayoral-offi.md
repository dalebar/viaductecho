Five Greater Manchester councillors have made it onto the Labour long list for the Gorton and Denton by-election after Andrew Gwynne's resignation. The party knocked back Andy Burnham's bid to stand, following the recent WhatsApp group scandal. Confirmed candidates include Manchester councillors Rabnawaz Akbar and Abid Latif Chohan, alongside Julie Reid and Angeliki Stogia, plus Bury council leader Eamon O’Brien, who is the only non-Manchester councillor. Interviews are set for January 28, and a shortlist will be created for local hustings on January 31. Coun Akbar has been representing Rusholme since 2018 and holds a key finance role, while Coun Chohan, from Longsight, influences major planning decisions. Coun Stogia has been in Whalley Range since 2019 and previously ran for a seat in Cheshire. Meanwhile, Coun Reid focuses on early years and children's services. There's speculation about Coun O’Brien being a future candidate for mayor after Burnham, although he’ll face stiff competition. All candidates have been invited for comments.
