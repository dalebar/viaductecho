This morning, there was a serious incident at a synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester. Armed police shot the suspected attacker, who reportedly had a device on him, though it's not clear if it was real or not. Sadly, a member of the public also lost their life, and another is critically injured in hospital. The attack involved a car-driven assault on people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, followed by a stabbing of a security guard. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) quickly declared a major incident and labelled it a suspected terror attack. Emergency services arrived shortly after the call, and police have urged the public to steer clear of the area as investigations continue. The bomb squad is also on site due to the potential threats presented by the suspect.
