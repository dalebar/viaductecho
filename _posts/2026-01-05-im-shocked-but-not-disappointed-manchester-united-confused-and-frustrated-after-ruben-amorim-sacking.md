Manchester United fans are feeling frustrated after the club sacked Head Coach Ruben Amorim just 14 months into his tenure. Following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Leeds, Amorim's criticism of the club's hierarchy seemingly sealed his fate. This marks the seventh permanent managerial change since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013. Many fans outside Old Trafford expressed that while they felt it was time for Amorim to go due to poor results and tactics, there’s concern over the club's ongoing instability and lack of strategic planning. Supporters like Mike Doyle lamented the merry-go-round of managers and the quality of players through the squad, hinting that without necessary changes and consistency, United's prospects remain bleak. Meanwhile, Darren Fletcher will temporarily take charge for the upcoming match against Burnley, with other names like Oliver Glasner and Enzo Maresca mentioned as potential permanent replacements. Fans are keen for a shift towards stability to restore the pride of their beloved club.
