Manchester is gearing up for a festive treat this Christmas with a brand new giant Santa, reminiscent of the beloved inflatable Zippy from years gone by. After a long closure for refurbishment, Albert Square is back in the celebration mix, featuring a market and a ferris wheel. Council spokesperson Pat Karney teased that the new Santa will be sitting atop the central library, as the town hall won't be ready until summer 2026. Alongside the festive cheer, there’s a new campaign to celebrate local pride, which includes a community events programme and the Pride in Manchester Awards, recognising local champions nominated by the community. Council leader Bev Craig highlighted the initiative as more than just fun; it's about unity and pride in Manchester’s diverse neighbourhoods. The city is also hosting various parades throughout the year, reflecting its vibrant culture.
