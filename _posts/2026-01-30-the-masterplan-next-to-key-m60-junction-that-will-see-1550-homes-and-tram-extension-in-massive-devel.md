A new town masterplan near the M60 junction, covering farmland between Simister and Bowlee, is set for approval next week. It includes plans for 1,550 homes, new roads, transport links, schools, health services, shops, and community spaces. This development is part of the larger Atom Valley scheme, which aims to create 17 million square feet of employment space and 20,000 skilled jobs in tech and manufacturing across Greater Manchester, particularly benefiting areas like Bury, Oldham, and Rochdale. 

The proposed project, known as the Northern Gateway, highlights the importance of new transport connections, including Metrolink extensions and a tram-train system that operates on both rail and tram tracks. The investment aims to tackle Greater Manchester's housing crisis while fostering a vibrant community with excellent access to green spaces and essential services.

Rochdale town hall is set to approve the framework on February 5, with the development seen as a significant opportunity for growth and a promising future for the region.
