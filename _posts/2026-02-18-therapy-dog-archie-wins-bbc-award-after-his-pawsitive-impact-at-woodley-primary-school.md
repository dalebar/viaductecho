Archie, a golden retriever therapy dog, has been bringing joy to Woodley Primary School, visiting every fortnight with his owner, Linda. His presence has profoundly impacted students, especially those facing social, emotional, or mental health challenges. For instance, he’s offered comfort to a year 3 pupil grieving her mum and encouraged a year 4 student to attend school more regularly. Their efforts earned them a BBC Make a Difference Award. During sessions, students read to Archie or simply enjoy his calming presence.

Headteacher Pete Langridge and Cllr Wendy Meikle both praised Archie's positive impact, highlighting how tailored support can help children feel more secure and connected.
