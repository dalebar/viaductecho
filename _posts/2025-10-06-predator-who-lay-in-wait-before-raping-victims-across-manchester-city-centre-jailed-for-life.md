Mourad Malki, also known as Sid Ali Djelid, has been sentenced to life in prison for a series of violent attacks in Manchester, targeting vulnerable individuals over five months. The 39-year-old predator was found guilty of five counts of rape, along with theft and fraud charges. Judge Tom Gilbart described his actions as a "campaign of rape," highlighting Malki’s deliberate efforts to identify and exploit victims’ vulnerabilities.

The court heard distressing accounts from the victims, including a woman who was raped twice after a night out and two men who were also targeted, all left feeling shattered and struggling to cope with the trauma. Malki's method involved luring victims away under false pretenses before committing his crimes.

He was given a life sentence with a minimum of 16 years before he can be considered for release, plus being placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life. The case starkly illustrates the serious impact of such predatory behavior on the lives of the victims.
