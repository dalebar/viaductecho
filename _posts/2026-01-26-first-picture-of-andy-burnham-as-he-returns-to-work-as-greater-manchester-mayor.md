Andy Burnham has returned to his role as Greater Manchester Mayor after being blocked from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election. He was recently spotted at The Whitworth art gallery discussing working class representation in the arts. Burnham expressed disappointment over the Labour Party's decision, claiming he wasn't informed of it before it was leaked to the media. Labour officials denied this, stating they tried to reach him promptly after the NEC meeting. The blockage has led to criticism from other Labour MPs, who suggest the move was politically motivated to avoid a potential leadership challenge from Burnham. Concerns have been raised about the party's chances in the upcoming by-election, with some calling the decision "utter nonsense" and an "own goal." Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer praised Burnham's work as mayor but stated that allowing him to run for Westminster would divert resources from upcoming elections.
