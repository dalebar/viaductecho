Traffic woes at junction 13 of the M60 in Worsley have hit a boiling point, as highlighted by local councillor Bob Clarke. He’s reported serious delays that are driving people out of Salford, with specific cases like consultants from Manchester Royal Infirmary moving due to commute struggles. Coun Clarke raised the issue during a recent council meeting, stressing the urgent need for National Highways to step up and address the ongoing chaos. Labour's Councillor Mike McCusker acknowledged the gravity of the situation, mentioning previous studies that have yet to yield results. He also indicated that discussions with the Department for Transport are on the agenda to tackle the transport issues impacting the area. Both councillors agree that action is overdue to prevent further economic decline and improve travel for locals.
