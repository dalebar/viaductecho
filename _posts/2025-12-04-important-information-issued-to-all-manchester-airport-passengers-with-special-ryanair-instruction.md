Manchester Airport's set to fully open its swanky £1.3 billion Terminal 2, but Ryanair's still sticking to Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. They've got some crucial info for all passengers, especially those flying with Ryanair, who'll need to check in at Terminal 1 (Departures A) and then take a short, clearly signed walk to Terminal 3 for their departure lounge. Shops and cafes in Terminal 1 are closed, but Terminal 3 is buzzing with options like Trattoria Milano, KFC, and WHSmith. Ryanair flights also arrive at Terminal 3, which remains unchanged. The airport promises more improvements on the way, including a sports bar and a new Italian restaurant set to open by early 2026. Staff will be around to help, so travellers should be all set!
