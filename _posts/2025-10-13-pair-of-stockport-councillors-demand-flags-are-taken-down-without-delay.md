Two Labour councillors in Stockport, Jon Byrne and Claire Vibert, have urged the council to remove flags from lamp-posts, expressing concern that they symbolise racism disguised as patriotism. During a council meeting on October 9, Cllr Byrne shared feedback from residents who felt distressed by the flags as part of a nationwide campaign, 'Operation Raise the Colours.' 

Cllr Vibert supported this stance, emphasising the importance of demonstrating intolerance towards acts that could intimidate community members. However, Stockport council, led by the Lib Dems, announced that flags will stay unless they pose safety risks or display slogans. Council leader Mark Roberts stated they are carefully considering the situation to avoid inflaming tensions. Flags will be monitored for safety and condition, and removal could occur if necessary. The council aims to balance community sentiments and avoid signals that could further divide residents over the flags.
