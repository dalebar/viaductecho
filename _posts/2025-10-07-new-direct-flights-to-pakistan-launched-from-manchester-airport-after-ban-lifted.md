Manchester Airport is set to launch direct flights to Pakistan later this month, following the lifting of a ban that had been in place since 2020 due to piloting safety concerns. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) will operate the nonstop service from Islamabad to Manchester twice a week starting October 25, catering to around 350,000 passengers annually. This new route is a significant convenience for those from the north of England, who previously had to connect via the Middle East or London. Manchester Airportâ€™s Managing Director, Chris Woodroofe, emphasised the importance of connecting the region to the world and addressing the travel needs of the local Pakistani community. PIA representatives highlighted the service will allow travellers to reach their destination in eight hours without long layovers. The UK Foreign Office still advises caution regarding travel near certain borders in Pakistan.
