Synth-pop legends Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are set to headline a gig at Rochdale Town Hall Square next summer on August 7, 2026. This performance marks their return to the town where they recorded their debut single, "Electricity," in 1979. OMD's Summer of Hits tour will feature special guests Peter Hook and The Light, along with Manchester's post-punk band A Certain Ratio. The concert is part of Rochdale's Music Stories campaign and highlights the town’s recognition as Greater Manchester's Town of Culture for 2025. Councillor Sue Smith expressed excitement over the event, noting the beautifully restored town hall square as the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable night of iconic hits. Tickets go on sale at 10am on December 22, and fans are encouraged to sign up for the pre-sale link.
