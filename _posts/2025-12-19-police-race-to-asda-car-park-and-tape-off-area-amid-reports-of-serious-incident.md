Emergency services rushed to an Asda car park in Shaw, Greater Manchester, on Thursday evening after reports of a serious incident. Officers arrived around 8pm, cordoning off a large area outside the supermarket on Greenfield Lane. Eyewitnesses reported that the store had closed, and an evidence screen was set up as part of the investigation. Multiple police vehicles and ambulances were on site, with officers blocking routes into the car park. The nature of the incident remains unclear, and Greater Manchester Police have been approached for further information but haven't responded yet. Emergency services stayed at the scene well into the night.
