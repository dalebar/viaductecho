A new photography exhibition titled 'Local / Connection' has opened at Stockroom, curated by the Amoeba Photography Network. Featuring 20 local photographers from Greater Manchester, the exhibition showcases diverse perspectives, from students to seasoned professionals. It runs until 19 April and is free to attend, inviting the community to celebrate creativity and connection. The photographers intentionally presented their work in the same size and frame to create an equal platform. Sandra Clare, an Amoeba photographer, reflects on her journey documenting the M60, feeling both a sense of connection and disconnection in Stockport. Each photographer’s interpretation of 'Local / Connection' varies, adding richness to the display. Additionally, Amoeba will host free events like photo walks and networking opportunities until April. Don’t miss out; it's a fab chance to engage with local art!
