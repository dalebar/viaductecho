Jihad Al-Shamie, the attacker at the Manchester synagogue, grew up in Crumpsall and has ties to local community members, with a former neighbour recalling how their sons played together. Al-Shamie's father, Faraj, worked at North Manchester General Hospital and is now a trauma surgeon for humanitarian organisations, previously associated with the Red Cross. The incident occurred on October 2, Yom Kippur, resulting in the deaths of two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, with four others injured, one sustaining a serious gunshot wound from police during the chaos. The family expressed their shock and disapproval of Jihad's actions, emphasizing their disconnection from the attack. Jihad was a British citizen of Syrian descent, having grown up in the UK since a young age.
