Greater Manchester Police (GMP) collected 368 knives during a week-long knife amnesty aimed at tackling knife crime. The initiative involved undercover operations by police cadets who tested retailers on responsible knife sales. Many shops passed, demonstrating awareness of the dangers. GMP stressed the importance of preventing knife access at the point of sale, with Superintendent Richard Thompson highlighting their focus on education alongside arrests. Officers made 116 arrests and recovered 63 knives through various operations. Additionally, they engaged with 39 schools to educate children about knife crime. Deputy Mayor Kate Green praised GMP’s proactive community efforts to make streets safer. Anyone with concerns about knife crime is encouraged to report it via GMP or anonymously through Crimestoppers.
