Four people arrested in connection with a fatal crash in Bolton have been released on bail, according to police. The incident occurred on January 11 on Wigan Road, resulting in the deaths of four individuals, including the drivers of a red Seat Leon and a Citroen C4 Picasso taxi. The arrested suspects included a 42-year-old woman and a 46-year-old man on fraud charges, a 22-year-old for handling stolen goods, and an 18-year-old for aggravated vehicle taking. They were held for questioning following raids on properties in Bolton last Thursday and have now been bailed while the investigation continues. The tragic accident claimed the lives of the Seat's driver, Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, and two passengers, as well as the taxi driver, Masrob Ali, with five others injured and taken to hospital.
