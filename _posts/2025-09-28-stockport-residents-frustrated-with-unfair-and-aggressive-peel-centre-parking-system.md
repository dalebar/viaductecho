Stockport residents are frustrated with the parking system at the Peel Centre, deeming it ‘unfair and aggressive’. They argue that vague signage and tricky pay machines have led to hefty fines, prompting over 100 people to sign a petition calling for free parking and the removal of current operator Ocean Parking. Petition organiser Gary Smith insists the system deters shoppers from supporting local businesses and urges The Peel Group to reconsider their approach. Stockport MP Navendu Mishra expressed concern over the situation and plans to meet with Ocean Parking about the fairness of their practices. Despite criticism, Ocean Parking claims improvements in safety and customer experience, citing a 47% increase in footfall since taking over the car park and asserting they've made key updates, including better signage and a new enforcement process. They also emphasize that customers can appeal fines through an independent service. The Peel Centre houses a variety of popular shops, making the parking situation a pivotal issue for local businesses and shoppers alike.
