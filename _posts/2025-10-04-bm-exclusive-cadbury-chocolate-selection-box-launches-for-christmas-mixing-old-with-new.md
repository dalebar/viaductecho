B&M’s new Cadbury hamper is the perfect festive treat this Christmas, featuring 10 items for £10, despite a reduction from 12 items in previous years. The box includes old favourites like Cadbury Buttons and Wispa, along with the new Dairy Milk Biscoff Bar. Inside, you'll find two 85g bags (Buttons and Twirl Bites), two 95g bars (Dairy Milk and Diary Milk Biscoff), a pack of three Daim bars, a Wispa, two Little Bars, and two hot chocolate sachets. 

B&M also has other festive goodies, like the McVitie's Jaffa Christmas Tree for £3 and a Swizzels Squashies & Friends sweet van for £3 too. Advent calendars like Maltesers Truffles and Terry's Chocolate Orange are also in stock. Plus, there are large tubs of Quality Street and Heroes available for £6 and £7, respectively, and cardboard crackers packed with treats for £4.75. Perfect for the sweet tooth this season!
