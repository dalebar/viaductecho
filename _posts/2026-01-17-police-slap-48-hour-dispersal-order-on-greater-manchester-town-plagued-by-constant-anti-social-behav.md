Police have issued a 48-hour dispersal order in Hindley town centre due to complaints about large groups of youths causing trouble at Tesco and throwing eggs at cars. The order, effective until 4pm on Sunday, empowers officers to remove anyone suspected of anti-social behaviour. GMP Wigan has identified some of those responsible and is collaborating with Wigan Council to pinpoint others. This isn’t a one-off; there was a similar order last September for the same issues. Local MP Josh Simons expressed support for the dispersal order, highlighting the ongoing challenge of anti-social behaviour across his constituency. He emphasized the need for stricter measures, like Respect Orders, to deal with repeat offenders effectively.
