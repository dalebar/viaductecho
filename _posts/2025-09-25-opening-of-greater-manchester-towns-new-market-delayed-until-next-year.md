The opening of the new Greater Manchester market in Oldham has been delayed to 2026 due to issues with fitting out the stalls. Originally scheduled for September, traders will continue at Tommyfield Market with extended leases into the new year. Councillor Arooj Shah reassured that preparations are in progress, aiming for a modern market that reflects Oldham’s legacy. Despite the delay, many traders expressed concerns over customer footfall, with some frustrated by the lack of notice about the move. Elaine Rothwell, who runs a card shop, voiced her annoyance but remains excited about the new market. Ray Aslam from the Traders’ Association noted that postponing until after Christmas allows everyone to set up properly. Overall, traders support the delay, appreciating the opportunity to be ready for the busy holiday season. In the meantime, Tommyfield Market remains open Monday to Saturday, from 9am to 5pm, welcoming customers to continue their support.
