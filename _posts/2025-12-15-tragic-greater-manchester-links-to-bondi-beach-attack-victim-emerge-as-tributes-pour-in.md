A tragic connection has emerged between the recent mass shooting at Bondi Beach, Sydney, which claimed 16 lives during a Hanukkah celebration, and Manchester's Jewish community. Among the victims was British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, whose cousin, Rabbi Dovid Lewis of the South Manchester Synagogue, expressed the deep shock felt, especially following the terror attack on Heaton Park synagogue in October, where two members were killed. The gunmen from the Sydney attack, a father-son duo, opened fire at a beach park, leading to over 40 injured. Local Jewish leaders noted the tight-knit nature of the community, feeling the impact of both tragedies keenly. Rabbi Lewis highlighted Mr Schlanger's dedication to spreading light and Torah, urging the community to respond with positivity. The heroism of Ahmed al Ahmed, who bravely intervened during the attack, has also surfaced, with him currently recovering in hospital after being shot.
