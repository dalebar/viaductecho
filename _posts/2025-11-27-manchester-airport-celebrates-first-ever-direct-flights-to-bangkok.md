Manchester Airport has just launched its first-ever direct flights to Bangkok, ending the need for travellers to rely on other hubs like Heathrow. The inaugural flight, operated by Norse Atlantic Airways, took off on Wednesday evening, marking a significant milestone in the airport's 88-year history. Last year, around 230,000 people travelled to Bangkok from the Manchester area via connecting flights. Now, with this weekly service on a Boeing 787-9, passengers can save both time and money. 

Stephen Turner, Manchester Airport's Commercial Director, expressed pride in connecting the north to global destinations, highlighting Bangkok as a popular travel spot. This new route not only benefits those heading to Thailand but also opens the region to tourists visiting from Bangkok, keen on experiencing all that Manchester has to offer, including its vibrant culture and football scene. Norse Atlantic's CEO, Bjørn Tore Larsen, noted the importance of this connection, emphasising Manchester's role as a vital gateway to northern England. The service will operate weekly through the winter until March 2026.
