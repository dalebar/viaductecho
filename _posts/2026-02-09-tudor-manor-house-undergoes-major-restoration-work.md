The roof repair of Bramall Hall, a historic Tudor manor house in Stockport, is proving quite the task, as the builders tackle its unique quirks and challenges. This £1.6 million project aims to preserve the grade I-listed building, which dates back to the 1380s. Luke Barlow, leading the project, is impressed by the original builders who managed it without modern tools. The restoration includes repointing chimneys, replacing stone slates, and repairing ancient timbers. As tour guide Rosie Horrod notes, prior to this work, rain would flood the interiors, risking damage to valuable artifacts. Funded by Arts Council England, this restoration follows a previous interior update in 2016. Interesting finds include Tudor wall paintings uncovered during the work, reminding everyone of the building's rich history. Overall, the aim is to secure Bramall Hall for future generations, showcasing its stunning architecture and extensive parkland.
