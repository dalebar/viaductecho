On Thursday, Stockport's in for a partly cloudy day with a good chance of rain. Temps will top out at 8°C and dip down to 4°C, so make sure you’ve got a warm layer handy. With an 84% chance of showers and high humidity (86%), it’s definitely a day for an umbrella or raincoat. The brisk winds could reach 21 mph, adding to the chill, so windproof gear is wise. 

For commuters, expect potential delays due to the wet and breezy conditions, especially on public transport—safe driving is a must as roads could get slippery. If you’re cycling, be careful with those gusty winds. 

It might be a good idea to plan for indoor activities or at least be ready for sudden downpours if you head out. Keep an eye on local weather updates, dress appropriately, and stay snug and dry!
