As winter approaches, the NHS in Greater Manchester is ramping up efforts to provide flu and Covid vaccinations, especially targeting vulnerable residents facing access challenges. With rising flu cases driven by a mutated strain, the NHS is holding extra clinics, drop-in sessions, and home visits to ensure everyone can get protected. Many individuals, particularly those who are homeless or have irregular schedules, struggle to visit traditional healthcare settings. Dedicated vaccination clinics are popping up at various community hubs, like the Barnabus Day Centre and the Wellspring, where healthcare staff offer support and address concerns over a cuppa. They're also collaborating with the A Bed Every Night programme to help those without stable housing access vaccinations more easily. Additionally, migrants, refugees, and housebound residents are being supported through outreach efforts. Those worried about missing out can reach the NHS Care Gateway team for assistance. Ultimately, the NHS emphasises that vaccinations are crucial for keeping everyone safe during the winter months.
