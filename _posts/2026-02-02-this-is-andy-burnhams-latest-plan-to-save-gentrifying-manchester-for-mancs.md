This month, a photo contrasting Manchester’s skyline from 2015 to now sparked discussions on social media. Over the past decade, skyscrapers have replaced empty lots, raising debates about their impact. Supporters claim these towers create jobs and affordable housing, while critics argue they dominate the skyline and cater to the wealthy, pushing out locals. Mayor Andy Burnham voiced concerns about the city's growth benefiting all Mancunians. He aims for change that includes everyone, addressing the need for affordable housing. Plans include 3,000 affordable homes by 2032 and greater focus on skills and job opportunities through the Greater Manchester Baccalaureate (MBacc), which provides vocational training and apprenticeships as an alternative to university. Young students are reportedly enjoying this hands-on approach, aligning with the job market's needs. However, challenges like T-level placement shortages exist. Burnham believes these initiatives could alleviate gentrification, although it might take time to see real results. Ultimately, it raises the question of whether future generations will still call Manchester home amid such rapid changes.
