Four students from St. James' Catholic High School in Cheadle Hulme—Scarlett, Jaxon, Charlie, and Cora—have bagged first place in the Callsign Challenge, a cyber security competition for schools across five boroughs. Their project, a cross-platform age verification app, allows users to verify their age just once, with secure data sharing among different platforms. The live final took place at Manchester's HOME gallery, where they received a trophy for their innovative work. The Challenge, a collaboration between Callsign and State Talking, aimed to enhance students’ skills in teamwork and problem-solving. After three months of hard work and mentorship from Callsign, the students successfully pitched their idea, impressing judges with their solution to streamline age verification. Both Scarlett and Jaxon expressed excitement about the experience, citing the nerves and joy of winning. The team has also been invited for a day with Callsign’s founder, Zia Hayat, to learn more about the tech industry. Chris Hutton from Callsign praised the participants for their creativity and insight into real-world challenges.
