Nigel Farage is in Gorton and Denton today, backing Reform UK candidate Matt Goodwin in his by-election campaign. Goodwin, who touts his local roots from delivering pizzas while studying at the University of Salford, believes the election will serve as a “referendum on Keir Starmer.” He’s confident that Labour's decision to block Andy Burnham from standing has significantly boosted Reform UK's chances in the traditionally Labour stronghold. 

Farage, in Denton with Goodwin, is engaging with supporters and reporters, stressing that residents feel overlooked by Labour, which he thinks will translate into votes for Reform. Both men shared a cuppa and banter about 'change' while preparing for a walkabout to rally support. Goodwin remarked that this by-election could be historic for Reform. Overall, they’re buzzing with optimism as they hit the campaign trail in the chilly Manchester weather.
