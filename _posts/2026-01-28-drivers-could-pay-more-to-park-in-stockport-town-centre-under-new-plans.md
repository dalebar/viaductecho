Stockport council is eyeing an increase in town centre parking charges to help save £500,000 from its annual budget. Proposed hikes include raising one-hour rates from £1.10 to £1.50 and two-hour rates from £2.20 to £3.00, with further increases for longer stays. Weekend parking rates will also see a rise. This review comes amid significant budget pressures, with a projected funding gap of around £75 million over five years, as noted by councillors at a recent meeting. 

Lib Dem Councillor Grace Baynam explained that the hikes are meant to reflect demand and help cover service costs, while Labour Councillor Dean Fitzpatrick expressed concerns about the impact on motorists and local businesses. The council is reportedly still cheaper than comparable towns. For those needing to park regularly, permits are available at reduced rates. New charges were recently introduced at previously free car parks as well. The council's budget plans will be finalised at a vote on February 26.
