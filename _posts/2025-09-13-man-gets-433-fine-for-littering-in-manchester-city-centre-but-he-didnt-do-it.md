A quirky advert from Keep Britain Tidy features a mallard chasing a man who casually drops a cigarette butt after binning a crisp packet. The council's intention to highlight that cigarette butts are litter is overshadowed by a blunder involving teacher Steve Jones, who received a criminal record due to mistaken identity. Despite being a non-smoker and miles away at a funeral when the offence supposedly occurred, he was wrongfully prosecuted for dropping the butt outside H&M in Manchester. Errors in identifying the real offender and communication mishaps with the city council led to the mix-up.
