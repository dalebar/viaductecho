On Tuesday, 30 September, officers from Greater Manchester Police conducted five stop and searches and checked six vehicles, seizing one for lacking insurance. The arrests were linked to various offences, including theft and breaches of licences. Throughout the day, the police engaged with local residents and shopkeepers, chatting and offering crime prevention advice at stalls set up in the Merseyway centre.
