Manchester's looking to revamp Princess Street (A34) to boost pedestrian access. The council’s launched a consultation to gather opinions on plans for wider pavements, improved crossings, and more space for walkers. This stretch, crucial for foot and bus traffic between Portland and Mosley Streets, is part of a broader effort to enhance walkways across the city, making it easier for pedestrians and cyclists while easing bus stop congestion. It connects key spots like St Peter’s Square and the civic quarter with landmarks such as the Town Hall and Central Library. Councillor Tracey Rawlins said the feedback so far shows Mancunians want safer and more enjoyable routes. The goal is to make Manchester an even better place to live, work, and visit. People are encouraged to share their thoughts in the consultation.
