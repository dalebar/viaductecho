The Victoria Breast Unit in Oldham might be moved to North Manchester General Hospital to ease the strain on Oldham’s overcrowded A&E, which has seen over 73,000 visits recently. This relocation is part of a £1.4 million plan to vacate space for a new Urgent Treatment Centre at Royal Oldham. The A&E department has been critiqued for long queues and subpar patient care, leading to a call for urgent improvements by the CQC. A report indicates that the move to Manchester is the quickest way to provide necessary urgent care services, although details about potential disruptions for current breast unit patients haven’t been shared yet. Oldham town hall is slated to discuss this proposal in an upcoming scrutiny meeting, with Councillor Barbara Brownridge supporting it as a positive step to alleviate hospital pressure, despite acknowledging the challenges for patients currently using the breast unit.
