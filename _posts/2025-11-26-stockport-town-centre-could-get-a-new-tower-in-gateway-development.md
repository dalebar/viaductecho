A former pub in Stockport, The George, could soon be replaced by a new 17-storey tower if plans get the green light from the council. This proposed development aims to add 76 apartments to the town, part of ongoing £1bn regeneration efforts that include new housing and transport hubs. The new building, located near Merseyway Shopping Centre, would feature mostly one-bedroom flats, with some two-bedroom units, along with co-working spaces and ground-floor business areas. The George, which has been vacant since 2017 and is now dilapidated, would be torn down for this project. The plan includes a commitment to affordable housing, with three units priced below market value. Planning reports highlight the development's design will respect the local area, and Stockport council's decision is due by February 18, 2026.
