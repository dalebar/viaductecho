Charlie Veitch started in 2009 as a YouTuber focused on spreading hope and truth through public activism, aiming to uplift those feeling downtrodden, often with a humorous approach. Over the years, his content has dramatically shifted, now capturing confrontations in Manchester with a more antagonistic tone. Critics describe his videos as exploitative, targeting vulnerable individuals like the homeless and asylum seekers, often using derogatory language. While he has a loyal following and garners millions of views, detractors argue his work fosters division and misrepresents Manchester, making the city seem chaotic and unsafe. Local leaders, including Mayor Andy Burnham, have expressed concerns about the negative portrayal of the region and the ethical implications of Veitch’s filming practices. As he roams the streets, camera in hand, Veitch's journey has sparked significant debate about the responsibilities of content creators and the impact of public perceptions on social issues.
