Owning a home in Stockport is becoming a tough dream for many, according to Labour councillors who highlighted a 45% increase in households in housing need since April 2024. Over 9,000 households are on the social housing register, and the council plans to spend Â£2m on emergency housing due to soaring demand. Councillor Claire Vibert echoed residents' frustrations about affordability issues, whether for mortgages or rentals, stressing the impact on families. While average house prices in Stockport are above the national average, significant efforts are underway to improve housing, particularly in the town centre with plans to build 8,000 new homes. A motion was proposed for the Lib Dem-led council to create a local plan to address these needs, which is expected to be ready by late 2026. The Lib Dems amended the motion, calling for government funding to support housing and infrastructure while prioritising brownfield sites over green spaces. The amended motion passed with considerable support in the council, indicating a shared acknowledgment of the pressing housing crisis in Stockport.
