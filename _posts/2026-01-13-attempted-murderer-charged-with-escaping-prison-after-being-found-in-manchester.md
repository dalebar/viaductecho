Kieran Cameron, a 43-year-old man serving a 23-year sentence for attempted murder, has been charged with escaping from HMP Thorn Cross and making threats to damage property. He went missing from prison on January 8 and was found days later in Hulme, Manchester, following a police search. After his arrest by Cheshire Police, Cameron appeared at Warrington Magistrates Court where he was remanded in custody. He’s set for a hearing at Chester Crown Court on February 9. The attempted murder conviction dates back to 2016, when he and another man stabbed a 22-year-old multiple times, aiming to frame a rival gang.
