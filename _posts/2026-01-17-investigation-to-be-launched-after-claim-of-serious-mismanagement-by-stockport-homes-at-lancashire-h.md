Staff are on 24-hour patrol at Lancashire Hill in Stockport due to serious fire safety concerns. Flats managed by Stockport Homes have been flagged for "serious mismanagement," leading to a council investigation. Councillor James Frizzell highlighted issues like faulty fire doors and ventilation systems, prompting a shift in fire strategy from 'stay put' to 'simultaneous evacuation.' 

Buildings affected include Clarkthorn Terrace, The Longsons, The Bentleys, and Stonemill Terrace. Stockport Homes expressed disappointment and is conducting an independent review while repairs are underway. They assured residents that safety measures are being prioritised, and no compliance issues have been noted in other properties. 

Frizzell pointed out a recent fire incident linked to a blocked bin chute that had been reported weeks prior, raising questions about safety protocols. Councillor Jake Austin confirmed that a joint action plan with Stockport Homes is in place, while Councillor Asa Caton voiced frustration over recurring safety issues. Stockport Homes, council-owned, manages over 12,000 properties in the borough.
