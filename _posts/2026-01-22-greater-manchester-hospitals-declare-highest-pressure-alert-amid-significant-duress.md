Greater Manchester's hospitals have been under significant pressure recently, hitting the highest NHS operational pressure level, OPEL 4, which indicates a risk to patient safety. This typically occurs in January due to seasonal illness spikes, particularly following increased flu admissions in December. Senior health leaders report that some hospitals have fluctuated between OPEL levels but not all trusts have reached the highest alerts. It's becoming evident that demand for urgent care is outstripping available resources, resulting in longer waits and fewer beds. The Integrated Care Board is urging coordinated responses across services to manage the load, including measures like same-day GP appointments and emergency care to limit hospital admissions. They’ve acknowledged that while some pressures are typical for this time of year, staff sickness and delayed discharges are exacerbating the situation. The spokesperson reassured the public about ongoing efforts to ensure access to necessary care and directed those in need to NHS 111 for guidance.
