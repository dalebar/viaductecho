High Peak Comps is gearing up for its biggest prize draws ever, including a £500,000 instant win contest and another draw for £25,000 with tickets priced at just 5p! The £500,000 draw features prizes up to £3,000, and every ticket also enters you into a final £10,000 draw on February 1st. Tickets can be purchased in bulk to increase your chances. 

Notably, Jade Lawrence won a staggering £100,000 from High Peak Comps last Christmas, showcasing the excitement around their contests. Beyond the fun, the company actively supports local causes, donating to numerous community projects and fundraising efforts in the area. 

Founded in March 2020, High Peak Comps has given away £12 million in prizes so far and continues to seek partnerships with local charities. If you're interested in their competitions or need community support, check out their Facebook page for more info.
