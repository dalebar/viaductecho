Dangerous concrete known as RAAC has been found at the Old Saint Maryâ€™s Hospital building on Oxford Road in Manchester. Discovered in a non-patient area, this lightweight material is known for its risk of crumbling and has been a concern in public buildings like schools and hospitals. The NHS has been conducting inspections due to the increasing fears about its widespread use, especially in the north west, which was reported as having the highest prevalence of RAAC in hospital roofs. Notably, three more hospitals were identified in 2023, with others, like the Royal Bolton Hospital, having to evacuate patients due to presence of RAAC. While Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust acknowledged that RAAC was flagged during a recent inspection, they are implementing support measures until it can be fully removed. The Department of Health noted that despite some clearances, many hospitals are still awaiting RAAC eradication. RAAC, used mainly in construction from the 1950s to the 1990s, poses serious safety threats due to its susceptibility to moisture damage, leading to structural failure.
