New research by Cambridge University historian Emily Chung uncovers that in Victorian Manchester, wealthy professionals like doctors and engineers lived amid working-class people in the so-called "slums." Using data from the 1851 census, Chung’s study challenges the long-held view that social classes were segregated primarily by residential areas. Instead, she found that work, shopping, pubs, and social life played larger roles in separating them. Over 60% of the wealthiest residents lived in the same buildings as unskilled labourers, and nearly 10% of Ancoats' population hailed from wealthier employed classes. This finding suggests that many middle-class Mancunians valued proximity to work over strict class divides. Cultural activities also highlighted class differences, with churches appealing to the middle classes and pubs more frequented by the working class. Despite some integration, social interactions remained limited, as police enforced a visible class divide in public spaces. Chung’s revelations offer a fresh perspective on class dynamics in industrial Manchester, emphasizing how historical perceptions can differ from the realities of urban living.
