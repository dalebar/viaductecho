Pokémon fans, don’t miss out on the treasure hunt in Stockport town centre this half-term, organised by Titan Pops! Kicking off on Monday, 27 October, this event features two trails: an easier one for kids and a trickier one for older participants. Starting at Titan Pops on Chestergate, hunters will use maps to find missing Pokémon held captive by pirates, scanning QR codes to collect them. The first letters of the captured Pokémon will help players figure out who the captors are. There are also prizes—packs of English mix cards—for those who complete the hunt, with daily limits per group. Keep an eye on Titan Pops' Facebook for full rules coming this weekend. This family-run shop has become a go-to spot for collectible Pop Vinyls and more since its opening. Titan Pops is open seven days a week: 10am-5pm Monday to Saturday and 11am-4pm Sunday at Graylaw House, Chestergate, SK1 1LZ. Happy hunting!
