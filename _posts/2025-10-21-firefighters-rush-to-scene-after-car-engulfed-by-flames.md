Last night in Wythenshawe, South Manchester, firefighters rushed to the scene after a car burst into flames around 7:30pm on Southmoor Road. Spectators watched as a fire engine arrived and crews worked to put out the fire, which was significant enough to engulf the vehicle. Thankfully, no injuries were reported. The Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that one fire engine from Wythenshawe was dispatched, and firefighters used breathing apparatus and a hose reel to tackle the blaze, spending about fifty minutes at the scene.
