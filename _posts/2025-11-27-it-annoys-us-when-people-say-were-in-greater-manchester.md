An organisation called Friends of Real Lancashire is frustrated with the mix-up of historic Lancashire and Greater Manchester, especially on Lancashire Day (November 27). This day marks the anniversary of Lancashire's first representatives attending Parliament in 1295. The group, led by Chair Philip Walsh, points out that many areas now in Greater Manchester—like Bolton and Bury—historically belong to Lancashire, while others like Manchester city centre were once part of Cheshire. Walsh emphasises the importance of recognising the full historic identity of Lancashire, as many people, including older generations, aren't aware of its longstanding heritage due to modern administrative divisions. Formed in 1996, the group aims to promote Lancashire's identity through events and initiatives, like the Lancashire Day Proclamation and the Lancastrian Awards. They’ve even created maps highlighting historical boundaries. Despite the administrative changes since 1972, Friends of Real Lancashire believes local culture and identity remain vital, and they strive to educate others about it.
