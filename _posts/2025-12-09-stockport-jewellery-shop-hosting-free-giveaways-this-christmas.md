Beaverbrooks in Stockport is spreading a bit of festive cheer this December by giving away five £50 gift cards! On Tuesday, 11th December, just pop into the store, say "Merry Christmas, Beaverbrooks!" to a team member, and you could snag one of the gift cards on a first-come, first-served basis. Get in the festive spirit by wearing a Christmas jumper, singing a seasonal tune, or bringing a festive item along. The first five customers who join in the fun and meet the criteria will score a gift card to spend on lovely jewellery or watches. Branch Manager Stephanie Wild is thrilled about this Christmas Cheer event and can’t wait to see the high street buzzing with joy. Want to know more? Check out their website for details on this festive giveaway.
