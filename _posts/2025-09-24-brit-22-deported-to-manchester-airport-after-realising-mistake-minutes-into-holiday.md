Rebecca McCurry, a 22-year-old Brit, faced a chaotic situation after forgetting her passport on a Ryanair flight to Marrakesh. She realised her mistake shortly after disembarking but was not allowed to retrieve it from the plane. Ryanair claimed they conducted a thorough search but later admitted she had misplaced it. During her distressing experience with Moroccan authorities, she was interrogated and intimidated, even fainting multiple times from stress. Despite the plane still being on the runway, she was told she might wait five days for her deportation. After 11 hours, she convinced officials she had an immigration lawyer (which she didnâ€™t) to get on a return flight to Manchester. Her passport was eventually found by passengers on another flight and turned over to lost property, leading to complications in retrieving it from Ryanair. Rebecca expressed frustration over the lack of accountability from the airline for her distressing ordeal, leaving her anxious about flying again. Ryanair maintains it followed protocol regarding passport checks and lost property.
