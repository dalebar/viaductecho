Bus workers are on strike from today until Thursday, affecting services from Metroline, which operates for the Bee Network. The strike, led by Unite the Union, stems from a pay dispute, with key routes impacted in Ashton, Hyde Road, Sharston, and Wythenshawe. Drivers are demanding fairer wages, as highlighted by Uniteâ€™s General Secretary, Sharon Graham, who criticised Metroline's prioritisation of profits over workers. Meanwhile, TfGM's Chief Network Officer, Danny Vaughan, stressed the need for ongoing negotiations to prevent further disruption. Notably, strikes from First and Stagecoach have been cancelled after revised pay offers were made.
