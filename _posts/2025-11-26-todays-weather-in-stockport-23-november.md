On Sunday in Stockport, expect a chilly, partly cloudy day with temperatures swinging from a brisk 7°C down to a nippy 3°C. There’s a 100% chance of rain, so be ready for everything from light drizzles to heavier showers. Humidity will be high at 88%, making things feel damp and cold, especially in the morning and evening. 

Wind gusts at 26 mph will add a bit of bite to the air, so it’s definitely a day for bundling up. If you're commuting, allow for extra time because the rain could slow things down on the roads and buses. 

Best to dress warmly and don waterproof gear—umbrellas at the ready! Layer your clothing to adapt to the chill and secure any outdoor belongings to prevent them from being blown about. If you've got outdoor plans, think about switching to indoor activities or postponing them to dodge the rain. Stay dry, folks!
