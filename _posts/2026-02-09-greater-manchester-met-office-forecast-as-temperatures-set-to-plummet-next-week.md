Greater Manchester's weather next week kicks off with rain, with showers on the cards nearly every day until Thursday. Monday sees highs of 10C and lows of 7C, with increased rain on Tuesday. Wednesday continues the wet trend, while by Thursday, temperatures drop, with highs around 9C and lows of 5C. Friday cools down further, reaching just 6C and lows of 1C, although rain eases and conditions become drier overnight. Moving into Saturday, there might be some sunny intervals, but it’ll still be chilly with highs of 7C and lows of 1C. Looking ahead, the Met Office hints at colder weather later in the month, potentially leading to snow, especially in the north and northeast, after much of the UK has faced a record stretch of rain. While the south has been hit hardest, nearly 90 high-level flood warnings have been issued across England.
