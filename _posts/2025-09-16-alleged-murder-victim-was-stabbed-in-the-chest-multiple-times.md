Kailem Reece Gibson, a 28-year-old father from Newton Heath, sadly died from multiple stab wounds to the chest following an alleged attack in his home on Gilmerton Drive on August 29. He passed away at Manchester Royal Infirmary the next day. During a pre-inquest hearing, Coroner Michael Appleton detailed the circumstances of his death and noted that Mr Gibson’s identity was confirmed through fingerprints. The coroner announced that the inquest would be adjourned due to ongoing murder charges against 35-year-old Martin Davies, who is accused of the crime. Mr Davies is in custody, with a trial set for February and a pre-trial hearing in November. In a heartfelt tribute, Mr Gibson’s family described him as a deeply loved son, brother, and friend, highlighting his warm nature and the joy he brought to others. They expressed that his legacy of love and kindness would endure in the hearts of those who knew him.
