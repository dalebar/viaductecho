A massive fire broke out at a scrap yard in Trafford, marking the second incident at the site within a year. The blaze at J Davidson's scrap yard on Craven Road started just before 3pm on Sunday, sending thick smoke visible for miles. Fire crews and police quickly arrived on the scene, implementing road closures and advising locals to avoid the area. This event mirrors a previous fire last March involving scrap vehicles, raising concerns among nearby residents and local councillor Ulrich Stephane Savary. He urged people to close their windows and take precautions, emphasising the proximity of the fire to homes. Thankfully, it's not yet known if there are any injuries, but the community is worried, prompting Savary to call on Trafford Council to engage with the owners. Firefighters tackled the flames for hours using aerial ladders and breathing apparatus. The cause of the fire remains unconfirmed, and J Davidson has been asked for a comment.
