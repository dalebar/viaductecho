A passenger at Manchester Airport filmed mice running near the seating area by Starbucks in Terminal One while waiting for a delayed flight to Belfast. The incident happened on September 15 at 9pm, prompting the holidaymaker to skip their coffee due to health concerns. Manchester Airport responded, assuring that they uphold high hygiene standards and take pest control seriously, employing measures like limiting food sources and conducting regular checks. They acknowledged that being close to outdoor areas can attract pests, and encouraged anyone who spots a mouse to inform staff. Starbucks has yet to comment on the situation.
