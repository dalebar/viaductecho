Albert's Schloss in Manchester is celebrating its tenth anniversary with a mix of Bavarian charm and outrageous performances, from cabaret acts to spectacular Oktoberfest celebrations. Known for bringing diverse audiences together, the venue features a lively atmosphere with food and drink inspired by Bavarian culture. Meanwhile, the beloved Apsley Cottage pub is facing closure, prompting community efforts to preserve it as a local heritage site, reflecting its historical significance for performers. Over at The Lowry in Salford Quays, plans are underway to secure funding for essential renovations to maintain its role in the area’s cultural landscape. Local boaters have voiced concerns about low water levels in the Rochdale Canal, which they attribute to leaks, complicating their living situation. In Ancoats, a long-standing barbershop is closing due to disruptive roadworks, which have severely affected trade. In lighter news, a lucky Oasis fan caught Noel Gallagher’s attention during a gig in LA, leading to a heartfelt moment on stage. Manchester's historic town hall restoration is also nearing completion, and recent pub events have seen a resurgence of local brews.
