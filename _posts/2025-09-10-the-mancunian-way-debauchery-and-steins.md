Albert's Schloss in Manchester is marking ten years of quirky performances, from cabaret to wild burlesque acts. Head of innovation, James Plant, highlights the venue's blend of Bavarian culture and eclectic entertainment. The spot is gearing up for a massive Oktoberfest celebration, aiming to top last year’s stein count. Meanwhile, the much-loved Apsley Cottage pub faces closure, prompting efforts to have it recognised as a community asset amidst concerns over traditional venues disappearing. The Lowry theatre is seeking £10m to upgrade its facilities, with some support from the Arts Council. In Rochdale, boaters are struggling with low canal water levels, believing it’s linked to a leak, while an Ancoats barber is closing after 43 years due to disruptive roadworks. In lighter news, an emotional Oasis fan had a memorable moment at a recent gig. Plus, there are some changes in the city, including the restoration of the historic town hall and the revival of Boddingtons at local pubs. Cheers to Manchester!
