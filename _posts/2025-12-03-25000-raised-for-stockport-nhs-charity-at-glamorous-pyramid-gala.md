The recent gala at the Stockport Royal Nawaab Pyramid raised a fantastic £25,000 for the Stockport NHS Charity. Held on 27 November, the event saw 400 guests enjoying exquisite food from top chefs and entertainment, including aerial acts and live music. Hosted by DJ Tommy Sandhu, with the raffle run by Charles Hanson from BBC's Bargain Hunt, the evening was a huge success. Funds raised will directly benefit vital services at Stepping Hill Hospital, including a new high-tech incubator for the neonatal team. Mahboob Hussain, the Royal Nawaab founder, expressed his delight over the event's success, emphasising the importance of supporting the community healthcare. Kate Leadbeater, Charity Manager, echoed this sentiment, appreciating the community’s effort in coming together for a worthy cause that enhances patient care and staff development at the hospital.
