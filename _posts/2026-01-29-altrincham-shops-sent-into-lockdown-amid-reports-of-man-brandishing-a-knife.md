Shops in Altrincham went into lockdown this morning (29 January) after reports of a man allegedly wielding a knife near the town's interchange. This led to customers, including kids, being locked inside businesses for safety. Parents received alerts about the situation, and police arrived to investigate. It turned out the man, aged 46, was actually holding a stolen phone rather than a weapon. He was arrested on suspicion of theft. The drama unfolded around 8:42 am as commuters made their way to work and children headed to school. Schools communicated with parents about the incident, noting a heightened police presence would be in place throughout the day. Greater Manchester Police confirmed the arrest and reassured the public that no weapon was found.
