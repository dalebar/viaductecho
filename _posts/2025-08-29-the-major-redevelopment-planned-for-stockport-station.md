Stockport train station is set for a major redevelopment, kickstarted by over £4m in government funding. The aim is to enhance accessibility and improve the overall experience for commuters. Local MP Navendu Mishra highlighted the station's condition in Parliament, and local councillors have echoed concerns. Proposed upgrades include better pedestrian connections and a new ramp shortcut from Thompson Street. This redevelopment, a collaboration among Stockport council, Transport for Greater Manchester, Network Rail, and Avanti, is seen as a pivotal opportunity to boost jobs and investment in the area. Mark Roberts, leader of Stockport council, emphasised the need for the station to reflect its status on Europe’s busiest rail line. The project aligns with a broader £1bn regeneration scheme in the town centre, which is also bringing new homes, shops, and facilities.
