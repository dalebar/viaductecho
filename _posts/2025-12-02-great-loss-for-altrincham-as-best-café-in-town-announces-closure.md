Oxford Road Cafe in Altrincham, a beloved spot for 15 years, is closing its doors for good on December 23 due to rising costs and insufficient government support. They announced this heartfelt decision, encouraging patrons to join them to celebrate the memories shared over the years. The cafe has been more than just a business; it was a hub for the community, hosting milestones and creating cherished moments. As the team prepares for the final days, they invite customers to share memories and tag them in photos for a proper send-off. The closure announcement has stirred sadness in the community, with many expressing their fondness for the cafe's welcoming atmosphere and delicious offerings, like their famous Eggs Benedict. The cafe has enjoyed rave reviews online, earning its reputation as a top family-friendly venue. Johnny and the ORC Team appreciate the support over the years and reflect on their pride in what they've created together.
