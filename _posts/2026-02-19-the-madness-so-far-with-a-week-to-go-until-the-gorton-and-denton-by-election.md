Just a month ago, Andrew Gwynne resigned after 21 years as MP for Gorton and Denton, following the fallout from the 'Trigger Me Timbers' scandal. His exit, prompted by health issues, kicked off a heated by-election battle slated for February 26. This race is now seen as a crucial test for Sir Keir Starmer and Labour, with strong competition from the Greens and Reform UK. 

Notable drama includes Andy Burnham’s thwarted bid to stand for Labour, allegations of misleading campaign content, and an incident involving a Conservative canvasser tossing a Reform leaflet in the bin. Each party has held eye-catching events, and candidates are trading barbs at public debates. 

High-profile visits from key politicians, such as Ed Miliband and Burnham supporting Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia, reflect the stakes involved. Meanwhile, social media has been buzzing with campaign blunders from all sides, from faux pas in messaging to campaign materials. With tensions rising, this election is shaping up to be an intense showdown in a traditionally Labour stronghold.
