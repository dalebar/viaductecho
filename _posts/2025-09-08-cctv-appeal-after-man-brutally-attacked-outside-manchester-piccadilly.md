A man trying to mediate a dispute was violently attacked outside Manchester Piccadilly station on August 30. After he intervened, he was punched and kicked by two men, even while lying on the ground. The British Transport Police (BTP) are investigating the incident and have released CCTV images of the two suspects they want to speak to. The victim managed to walk away but was assaulted again as he attempted to escape. The extent of his injuries remains unconfirmed. BTP encourages anyone who recognises the men in the images to contact them with information.
