The proposal for the Godley Green Garden Village in Hyde, featuring over 2,150 homes, has been rejected following massive local opposition—over 4,000 objections. At a recent Tameside council meeting, locals celebrated the decision, highlighting concerns about preserving green spaces and potential disruptions. While the developers, MADE Partnership, had included plans for infrastructure improvements and community facilities funded by nearly £29 million, councillors found the proposal too ambiguous. There were criticisms of the low percentage of affordable housing and worries about environmental impacts, like CO2 emissions and destruction of wildlife habitats. Objectors also voiced fears of community disruption and the threat to long-time residents. The developers maintain they followed legal protocols and would enhance green spaces, yet councillors felt unsure about the clarity and viability of the proposal. The decision isn’t final, as it will be reviewed by the government’s planning inspectorate for a conclusive call.
