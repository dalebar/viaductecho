Andy Burnham has commented on the hefty £95 million cost increase for the refurbishment of Manchester Town Hall, bringing the total budget to £525 million and pushing the completion date to spring 2027. This news has sparked criticism from opposition councillors, who call it a ‘disaster of project management.’ However, Labour’s Garry Bridges attributed the extra costs to wider issues like the pandemic and the war in Europe. Speaking on BBC Radio Manchester, Burnham described the project as complex, acknowledging the nature of heritage work often brings unexpected challenges that can lead to overspending. He commended the council for beginning the work, suggesting it will ultimately save taxpayers money. Since the delays and budget increase, new issues have emerged, and some contractors have gone bust, complicating the project further. Despite concerns, project managers assure that financial oversight is strict to ensure taxpayers’ money is well spent.
