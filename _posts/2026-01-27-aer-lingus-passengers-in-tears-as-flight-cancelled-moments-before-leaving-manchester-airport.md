Passengers at Manchester Airport were left heartbroken after their Aer Lingus flight to New York was cancelled, despite the plane later departing without them. The cancellation, caused by severe winter weather across North America, affected many travellers, including Leanne Rimmer and her family, who had planned a £4,500 holiday. Passengers reported poor communication from staff, with one describing the atmosphere as silent when the cancellation was announced. Rimmer's family lost £1,100 on tickets for events they can no longer attend. Similarly, Rob and Hannah Chappel were devastated ahead of Rob’s 40th birthday trip, feeling let down as their flight was eventually taken by crew members. Both couples expressed frustration at Aer Lingus’s handling of the situation and the airline's decision to end its flights from Manchester to JFK after March. Aer Lingus apologised for the cancellation and is in touch with affected customers about alternative solutions.
