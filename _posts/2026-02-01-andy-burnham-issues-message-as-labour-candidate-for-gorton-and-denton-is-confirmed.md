Andy Burnham recently congratulated Angeliki Stogia, the new Labour candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election happening on February 26. This follows Andrew Gwynne's resignation, who had served since 2005 but stepped down due to ill health amid criticism from leaked WhatsApp messages. Burnham, initially interested in running, was blocked by the Labour National Executive Committee but is now supporting Stogia. Stogia, a naturalised citizen originally from Greece, has been a Labour representative since 2012 and is eager to campaign for a united Manchester. She expressed excitement about her candidacy and the importance of engaging with the community to ensure every vote counts. Other parties, including the Green Party and Liberal Democrats, have also announced their candidates for the by-election.
