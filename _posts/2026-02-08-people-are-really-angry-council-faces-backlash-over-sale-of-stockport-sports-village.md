A public meeting in Woodley turned tense as residents expressed anger over Stockport council's decision to sell Stockport Sports Village to Stockport County Football Club, effective April 1. The gym and studio classes will close, and locals are concerned about the impact on their community, particularly the lack of alternative facilities. Independent councillors Joe and Rosemary Barratt acknowledged the frustration and emphasized they weren't part of the decision. Many attendees voiced worries about job losses and limited access to fitness services. Personal trainer Johnny McDermott shared fears for his livelihood, while others raised concerns about local teenagers losing a safe space. The council maintains that the sale will support long-term goals for education and community development, including plans to expand Stockport County's educational programmes. They promised to assist affected gym members with transitions to other facilities. Although council leaders see the sale as a positive step for the borough's future, residents are sceptical about losing a valued local resource.
