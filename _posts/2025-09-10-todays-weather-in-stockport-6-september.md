Stockport's weather on Saturday looks pretty lovely! Expect partly cloudy skies with a comfy high of 21°C and a cooler low of 11°C. Humidity will be around 70%, making it feel a bit moist, but overall, it's spot on for outdoor fun with no rain in sight. Just bear in mind there’ll be brisk winds at 21 mph, so while it's a great day to head out, cyclists might want to take it easy. For commuters, visibility should be clear and driving will be smooth. Dress in layers, maybe grab a light jacket for the wind, and keep your sunnies handy for those sunny spells. Enjoy your day out in Stockport!
