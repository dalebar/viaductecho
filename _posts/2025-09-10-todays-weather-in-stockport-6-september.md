On Saturday, Stockport's set for a lovely day with partly cloudy skies and no rain in sight. Expect a comfy high of 21°C and a cooler low of about 11°C, with a bit of humidity making it feel nice. The breeze at 21 mph will give a fresh vibe, so you might feel it as you step out. 

Perfect weather for all sorts of outdoor fun—be it a stroll, a game, or just hanging around enjoying the scenery. If you're commuting, the dry conditions are great for driving, but cyclists should watch out for those gusts. Dressing in layers is a smart move today, and while it's not a rain kind of day, a light jacket and some sunnies could come in handy when the sun breaks through. Enjoy your Saturday!
