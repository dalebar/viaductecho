Police in Oldham town centre have imposed two orders giving them extra powers following a bout of violence today. This comes after reports of disorder led to five arrests—two for violent disorder and three for carrying offensive weapons. The move is part of ongoing issues with youth-related disturbances in the area. A section 35 dispersal order allows officers to order people suspected of antisocial behaviour to leave the area for 48 hours, while a section 60 stop-and-search order enables searches without suspicion for weapons within a defined region. Both orders, initiated around 1:25 PM, aim to maintain safety, with neighbourhood officers increasing their presence. Inspector Amie Whitehead emphasised that these measures are vital to curb further disorder and protect the community. Locals are encouraged to approach officers with any concerns.
