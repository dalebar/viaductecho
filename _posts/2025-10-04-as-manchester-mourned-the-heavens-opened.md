In Manchester, a significant vigil took place to honour the victims of a horrific attack at the Heaton Park synagogue. Despite heavy rain, crowds gathered in defiance, showing their solidarity and grief. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy faced criticism during the event, while Rabbi Daniel Walker delivered a poignant speech addressing the tragedy. Two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were named as the victims, with Daulby hailed as a hero for trying to protect others during the attack. Sadly, he was accidentally shot by police while thwarting the assailant, Jihad Al-Shamie, who was subsequently killed by officers. Al-Shamie's family condemned his actions, expressing shock at the violence. Additional arrests were made as part of the ongoing investigation, which indicates Al-Shamie had potential links to extremist ideology, though he had not been previously known to counter-terrorism authorities. The community has united in grief, while authorities continue to probe the circumstances surrounding this tragic event.
