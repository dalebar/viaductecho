A charming three-bed cottage in Worsley, Salford, is on the market for £450,000 and has been featured as the Property of the Week. This Grade II-listed gem brims with character, boasting original features such as exposed wooden beams and a cosy open fire. Spread across three floors, it offers a snug lounge, a separate dining room, a farmhouse-style kitchen, and two double bedrooms on the top floor. There’s potential for even more space with an additional sitting room that could serve as a fourth bedroom. The garden is lovely, perfect for relaxing or al-fresco dining, plus there's an outbuilding offering workshop or office possibilities. Nestled in the heart of Worsley village, the area is rich in history and local amenities, including schools, shops, and scenic walks along the Bridgewater Canal. With good transport links to Manchester city centre and beyond, this property is a rare find, finely updated while keeping its historic charm. Estate agents Miller Metcalfe recommend an early viewing to fully appreciate this unique home.
