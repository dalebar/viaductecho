A gunman shot at a house in Salford, reportedly targeting the wrong property, as police investigate potential mistaken identity. The incident occurred on October 6, with at least seven shots fired into a home on Lissadel Street, but fortunately, no one was injured. Five men aged between 20 and 39 were arrested on suspicion of firearm possession but were released on conditional bail after questioning. Local resident Brian Cooper expressed his shock upon learning about the attack, having thought it was a brick that shattered his window. Detective Chief Inspector Martyn Johnson reassured the community, noting that the use of firearms is unacceptable and urging anyone with information to come forward. The police are gathering intelligence to understand the motive behind the shooting.
