The Park View pub in Blackley has been transformed into a festive wonderland this December, thanks to the dedication of landlords Steve and Dan. Inspired by a former local spectacle known as the ‘Christmas House’, Steve aims to rekindle that community spirit. With a dazzling light display and scenes from Santa's workshop, the pub is a nod to cherished Christmas memories. Regulars and neighbours have embraced this festive revival, even surprising the landlords with a spa day last Christmas, showing their gratitude for the warmth the pub has brought back to the area. Steve has worked hard to rebrand the formerly known Hilltop pub into a welcoming hub for families. Despite the financial strain of the decorations, Dan emphasizes the joy it brings to children and the community. The pub also played a role in supporting local events, like a buffet for mourners after the passing of a beloved local figure. The whimsical atmosphere has inspired neighbours to join in on the festive spirit, bringing a renewed sense of camaraderie to Heaton Park Road.
