Plans are afoot for a new housing estate at Broadbent Moss, just off the tram route from Oldham to Shaw and Crompton. Kellen Homes Limited is set to build nearly 250 homes on this former greenbelt site, part of a larger initiative to tackle Greater Manchester's housing crisis. The proposed development includes a mix of market and affordable homes, with the affordable units to be managed by a yet-to-be-named housing provider. Developers aim to create a ‘walkable neighbourhood’ with new roads and public green spaces, connecting Royton via a new spine road. However, the move has generated backlash from locals worried about increased congestion and the loss of open green space since the area has recently lost its greenbelt status. The planning aims to blend the new homes with the natural landscape while addressing the need for more housing in the region.
