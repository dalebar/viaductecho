The Magnet Pub in Heaton Norris has snagged the title of 'best mild pub' from local ale lovers during the annual Mild Magic Ale Trail, organised by CAMRA. This year, it featured a rotating selection of nine mild ales, making it a standout destination among the 101 participating pubs in Stockport and South Manchester. The trail saw around 5,500 visits, with 260 participants taking on challenges, marking a 25% jump in engagement. Blackjack Dark Ruby was voted the best mild ale, available at various spots. Outgoing organiser Darren Berry praised everyone involved for promoting this unique beer style and encouraged folks to keep supporting mild ales. The next Mild Magic Trail is set for Spring 2026, so keep an eye out for updates!
