The Magnet Pub in Heaton Norris has clinched the title of 'best mild pub' during the annual Mild Magic Ale Trail, as voted by local ale fans. Organised by CAMRA, this year's trail was a hit, drawing around 5,500 visitors and seeing 260 participants tackle various challenges, including four who managed to hit all 101 participating pubs. The Magnet stood out with its impressive selection of nine changing mild ales. The winners of the best mild ale were Blackjack Dark Ruby, available at multiple locations. Outgoing organiser Darren Berry expressed gratitude to all pubs, breweries, and participants for supporting traditional mild ales, noting a record turnout this year. He hinted at the growing popularity of milds, especially after Penzance Mild was recently named Champion Beer of Britain. The next Mild Magic trail is set for Spring 2026, keeping the love for mild ales alive and kicking!
