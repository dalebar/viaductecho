Gary "Mani" Mounfield, the beloved bassist from The Stone Roses and Primal Scream, was remembered in a heartfelt farewell in Manchester, with family, friends, and fans turning out to pay their respects. Stone Roses' frontman Ian Brown led the tributes, describing Mani as "like a brother" and a "beautiful human being." Hundreds gathered outside the cathedral, applauding as the funeral procession arrived, led by scooter riders and accompanied by The Stone Roses' hit "I Wanna Be Adored."

Mani’s distinctive bass playing was a key part of the iconic "baggy" sound, featuring in tracks like "Fools Gold." He was pivotal in establishing The Stone Roses at the heart of the "Madchester" scene during the late 80s and 90s, culminating in a legendary gig at Spike Island. Sadly, Mani passed away peacefully in his sleep due to respiratory issues linked to emphysema.
