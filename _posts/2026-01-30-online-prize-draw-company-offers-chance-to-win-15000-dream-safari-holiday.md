High Peak Comps is gearing up for some fantastic prize draws over the next few weeks! They're offering a dream safari holiday worth £15,000 or a £10,000 cash alternative for just 29p a ticket. The competition ends on February 15, with the winner announced on their Facebook page. Additionally, there’s a chance to win a coveted Rolex GMT Master II Sprite watch, or an £11,000 cash alternative, with tickets priced at 25p each. This draw closes on February 22.
