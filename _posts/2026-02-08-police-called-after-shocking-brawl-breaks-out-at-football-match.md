Footage shows a player throwing punches at spectators while another clip reveals a coach striking a non-player on the pitch. The match ended with Droylsden winning 2-0, advancing them closer to a Wembley final. West Midlands Police confirmed they are gathering details and reviewing CCTV, with no arrests made yet. Both clubs acknowledged the incident, with Bilston stating that the videos did not represent the game as a whole and expressing appreciation for Droylsden’s cooperation.
