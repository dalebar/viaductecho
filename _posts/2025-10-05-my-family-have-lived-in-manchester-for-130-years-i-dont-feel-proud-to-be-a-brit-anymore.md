Chava Lewin and her husband, neighbours of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue, are shaken after a recent terror attack nearby during Yom Kippur, which resulted in two deaths and several injuries. Though they weren't attending the synagogue at the time, they heard gunshots and were urged to stay indoors. Chava expressed her fear of being a Jew in the UK, feeling unsafe and questioning government support, stating that many in the Jewish community no longer feel like Brits. The couple has lived in Manchester for generations, but this incident has made them reconsider their sense of belonging. Following the attack, which involved the death of the assailant, the community held a vigil that saw emotional responses, including anger towards officials. Forensic teams continue to investigate, and six individuals have been arrested in connection with the incident.
