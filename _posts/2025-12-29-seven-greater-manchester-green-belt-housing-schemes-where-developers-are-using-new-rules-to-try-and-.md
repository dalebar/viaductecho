The idea of 'green belt' land being strictly protected is facing scrutiny with the introduction of the 'grey belt' concept. In December 2024, the UK government revised planning policies to support the construction of 1.5 million new homes in England, aiming for about 300,000 homes annually until 2029 to address housing shortages. This includes identifying 'grey belt' land within the green belt that can be developed while maintaining overall green belt principles. However, organisations like the Campaign to Protect Rural England have raised concerns over potential large-scale developments on previously untouched rural land. 

In Greater Manchester, numerous ambitious plans are emerging for developments on green or former green belt areas, with several specific proposals under consideration, including significant residential estates in Bury, Tameside, and Bolton, alongside smaller developments. Local councils and residents have expressed worries regarding these proposals and the potential consequences for community spaces and environmental integrity. Overall, the push for housing is leading to a complex dialogue around land use and development across the region.
