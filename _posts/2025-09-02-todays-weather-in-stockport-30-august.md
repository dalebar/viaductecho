Saturday in Stockport is looking a bit of a mixed bag, featuring a blend of clouds and rain. Expect temps to range from a high of 18°C down to about 12°C, with a steamy humidity level of 82%. There's a 100% chance of rain, so definitely bring your brolly and waterproofs along. 

The day kicks off with some clouds and sporadic sunshine but don’t let that fool you—rain’s on the way, likely to be quite heavy at times. Winds will be brisk, hitting up to 27 mph, which might make it feel chillier than it is. 

For those commuting, take care on the roads—allow some extra time for your journey since wet conditions can lead to delays and reduced visibility. Dress in layers and ensure you've got waterproof shoes handy. Planning some indoor activities could be smart, too, given the persistent rain expected. Stay dry and enjoy your day!
