Saturday in Stockport is shaping up to be quite the mixed bag, with a lot of clouds and rain to look forward to. Expect temperatures around 18°C during the day and dipping to 12°C at night, all with a sticky humidity at 82%. Yep, it's going to rain for sure—100% chance, so definitely grab your waterproof gear!

Clouds will be around most of the day, with a chance for some sunshine peeking through. Wind from the south-west will be brisk, hitting speeds of 27 mph, which might make it feel a tad cooler, especially with the rain. 

If you're commuting, be prepared for delays due to wet roads and remember to check your windscreen wipers. Dress in layers, wear waterproof shoes, and keep that umbrella handy! Indoor plans might be the best bet today. Stay dry and make the most of it!
