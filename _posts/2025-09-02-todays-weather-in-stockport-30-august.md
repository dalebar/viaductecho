Saturday in Stockport is looking a bit gloomy with a real mix of clouds and rain on the cards. Expect temperatures from a high of 18°C to a low of 12°C, and keep in mind it's going to feel muggy with humidity at 82%. Rain is nearly a sure thing at 100%, and we’re also in for brisk winds hitting 27 mph, which might make things feel chillier than they are. 

The day will kick off with some clouds, but we might see a few sunny breaks here and there before the rain takes over. If you’re commuting, it’s a good idea to give yourself extra time, as roads could get a bit slippery and visibility might be off due to the rain. 

Dress in layers, don those waterproof shoes, and don't forget an umbrella to tackle the day without hassle. Might be best to stick to indoor plans to keep the fun rolling despite the wet weather!
