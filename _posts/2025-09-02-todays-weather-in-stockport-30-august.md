This Saturday in Stockport is shaping up to be a wet and breezy day. Expect a mix of clouds and rain, with temps hitting a high of 18°C and dropping to around 12°C. It's going to be humid too, at 82%, so it might feel a bit muggy. With a 100% chance of rain, be prepared for a proper soaking, and make sure you’ve got your waterproofs handy!

Winds from the south-west will be brisk, reaching up to 27 mph, which might make it feel chillier, especially when combined with the rain. If you're commuting, take it easy—allow for extra travel time due to potential delays from the wet roads.

Dress smartly in layers and don’t forget your waterproof shoes and umbrella! Planning for some indoor fun might be a good shout to keep things enjoyable despite the dreary weather. Stay dry out there!
