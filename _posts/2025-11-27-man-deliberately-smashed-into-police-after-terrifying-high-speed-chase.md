Benjamin Walsh, 37, led police on a wild 16-minute chase, driving dangerously before crashing into a police vehicle. The pursuit began when officers noticed his van bypassing cars, during which he ran four red lights and drove on the wrong side of the road. Eventually, he sped into a residential area at 50mph, then deliberately reversed into a police car after stopping. Officers found his van used false registration plates and equipped to siphon fuel from lorries. In court, it was revealed that Walsh had turned to crime due to financial pressures on his family. He was sentenced to 26 months in jail and banned from driving for two years. His lawyer noted that he felt remorseful and embarrassed about his actions, explaining that he turned to stealing fuel to support his family.
