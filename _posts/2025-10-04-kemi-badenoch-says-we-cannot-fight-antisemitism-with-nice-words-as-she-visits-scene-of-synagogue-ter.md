Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has urged the government to take a firmer stance on antisemitism, stressing that "nice words" aren't enough. During her visit to Heaton Park synagogue, where a recent terror attack tragically left two dead and four injured, she emphasised the need for actionable change. Badenoch condemned the pro-Palestine marches, suggesting they often mask intimidation against Jewish communities, particularly given their timing on Yom Kippur after such a violent event. She expressed concern over Jewish people's safety, noting that many feel the need to leave for Israel, despite it being a war zone. Badenoch called for stronger government action to reassure and protect Jewish individuals in the UK, asserting that Britain should always be a safe haven for them.
