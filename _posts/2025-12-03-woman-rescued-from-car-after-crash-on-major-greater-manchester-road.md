A woman was rescued from a car after a collision on Broadway near Elk Mill retail park in Royton at around 10.45am on December 3. The crash involved a grey Vauxhall Astra and a red Skoda Fabia. Emergency services, including firefighters, police, and paramedics, quickly arrived on the scene. The woman was freed from one of the cars and treated by paramedics, but thankfully, no serious injuries were reported. Both drivers experienced shock and received treatment. The Vauxhall Astra had part of its roof cut off and was later taken away by a recovery truck, along with the Skoda. Fire crews from Heywood and Oldham were on-site for about 45 minutes to secure the area and assist the injured. Greater Manchester Police also helped manage traffic in the area.
