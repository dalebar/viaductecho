Starting 1 November, Stockport and Greater Manchester will offer free bus travel around the clock for older and disabled people. Previously, they could travel for free only between 9.30am and midnight on weekdays. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) aims to enhance access to healthcare, leisure, and shopping with this initiative. Mayor Andy Burnham noted the success of a recent trial, where over 100,000 journeys occurred before 9.30am. This new phase is designed to assess the feasibility of making unlimited travel permanent, ensuring it supports residents' needs. Community leaders highlight the benefits for mental health and social integration, emphasising the importance of older people's input in shaping transport policies. The move reinforces commitment to accessibility and equality for all community members.
