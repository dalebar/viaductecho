Passengers are being advised to plan ahead as a big engineering project kicks off on the West Coast Main Line, affecting trains between Manchester and London. The work, starting on Christmas Eve, focuses on Hanslope Junction, a key site that has caused over 11,000 minutes of delays in the past five years. The £26m upgrade aims to improve reliability and reduce disruptions. The closure will affect travel to and from London Euston until January 5, with no trains running between Milton Keynes and Northampton or Rugby for 11 days. During this time, additional improvements, like track renewals and station upgrades, will also take place. Network Rail’s operations director, Steve Hopkinson, emphasised the importance of this upgrade for future service reliability and encouraged passengers to check their journeys before heading out.
