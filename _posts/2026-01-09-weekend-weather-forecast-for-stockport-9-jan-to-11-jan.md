This weekend in Stockport is shaping up to be quite a mixed bag weather-wise. On Friday, expect overcast skies with a 100% chance of rain or snow, temperatures between 4°C and 1°C, and brisk winds up to 26mph, making it feel colder. Saturday brings partly cloudy skies, clearer conditions with a high of 3°C, and a low of -3°C, alongside much calmer winds at 4mph—perfect for getting out and about. Sunday returns to cloudy conditions with a high of 6°C, a low of -1°C, and another chance of rain or snow, plus wind gusts reaching 32mph. Commuters should be cautious on Friday and Sunday due to slippery roads and reduced visibility but Saturday’s probably your best bet for hassle-free travel. If you're planning outdoor fun, Saturday’s the day to do it; otherwise, dress for wet weather and consider some cozy indoor activities.
