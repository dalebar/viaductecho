The former NatWest bank on Long Street in Middleton, which closed in April, is set to be transformed into a church by the Churches of God. The conversion plan includes a main service hall and meeting spaces across two floors, aiming to preserve the building's character while serving the community. This move follows a recent trend of banks turning into churches in Middleton, as the Redeemed Christian Church of God has also gained approval for two such projects. The changes reflect the shift in local banking, with Halifax bank scheduled to close in January 2026. Despite this, a pop-up Barclays service will remain available three days a week at the Lighthouse Project Community Hub.
