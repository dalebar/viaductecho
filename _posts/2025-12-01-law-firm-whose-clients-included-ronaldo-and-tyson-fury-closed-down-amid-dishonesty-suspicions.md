Altrincham-based IPS Law, led by sports lawyer Christopher Farnell, has been shut down by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) over suspicions of dishonesty. Farnell, who has represented big names like Cristiano Ronaldo and Tyson Fury, is accused of not complying with account rules and the solicitors' code of conduct. The SRA’s action came after concerns about his management of the firm's affairs. Farnell's notable career includes advising various Premier League clubs and assisting on significant transfers, like Marouane Fellaini's record move to Everton. Earlier this year, the High Court rejected a costs budget from IPS Law, suspecting it had been deliberately inflated. Farnell has been suspended from practice, and though approached for comment, he has yet to respond.
