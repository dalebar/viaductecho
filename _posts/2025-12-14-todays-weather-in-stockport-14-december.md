Stockport's weather on Sunday is looking a bit mixed. Expect a cloudy day with early morning rain and temperatures ranging from 8°C to 11°C. With high humidity at 81% and a 100% chance of rain, it’s going to be a wet start. A brisk 26 mph wind will make it feel cooler, so bundle up! Rain should ease off later, but clouds will linger, possibly letting a bit of sunshine break through. 

If you’re heading out, drive carefully as roads might be slippery. Public transport users should definitely pack an umbrella and raincoat, just in case. Layered clothing is key for staying comfy throughout the day. It might be a good plan to enjoy some indoor activities or pop into a local café, but if you do go outside, make sure you’re ready for the cool, breezy weather.
