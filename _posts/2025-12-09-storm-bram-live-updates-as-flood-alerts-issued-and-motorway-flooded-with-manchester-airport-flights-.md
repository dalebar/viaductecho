Storm Bram is hitting the UK, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds. The Met Office has issued 10 warnings, including a yellow warning for parts of Greater Manchester—covering areas like Bolton, Bury, and Rochdale—until 3pm today. Flood alerts are in place for the Upper and Lower River Irwell, and the M66 motorway is partially closed near Ramsbottom due to flooding and an earlier incident.

Manchester Airport has had to cancel several flights due to the storm, with Dublin Airport also facing disruptions, reporting 42 flight cancellations. Passengers are advised to check with airlines for updates.

In the broader UK, there are now 37 flood warnings and 178 amber flood alerts in effect, prompting residents to act quickly. Roads in Ramsbottom are also heavily affected, with gridlock reported, and local firefighters are clearing water from affected areas.

Heavy rain is expected to clear later today, but drivers should remain cautious due to ongoing disruptions.
