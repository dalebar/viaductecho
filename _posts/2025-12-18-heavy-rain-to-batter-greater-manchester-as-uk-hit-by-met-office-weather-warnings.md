Greater Manchester’s in for some serious downpours today after a misty morning. While the South is bracing for heavy rainfall, the North will face its own bout of wet weather. Expect mist until about 11am, followed by six hours of heavy rain until around 5pm. Light rain and showers might linger into the evening before a dry, partly cloudy night sets in, with temperatures hitting around 10°C and dropping to 4°C overnight. Good news for Friday, though—it's looking much drier with overcast skies and some sunny spells in the afternoon. Saturday should keep the sunshine going, and Sunday will see dry but overcast weather. Both days are expected to hit highs of about 9°C. Just so you know, there are weather warnings for the South West and South Wales from 10am to 7pm and for southern England from 9am to 9pm. Stay dry out there!
