Rosealeen Sullivan, 33, from Stretford, has been jailed for 18 months after violently attacking her pregnant friend during a wine-drinking session at the friend's home in Adlington, Cheshire. The incident occurred when the victim, who was sober, expressed her tiredness and was met with Sullivan's hostility. In a sudden act of aggression, Sullivan smashed a wine glass into the woman's forehead, causing significant bleeding. The victim subsequently stepped on the broken glass, injuring her foot. Police responded to the scene after an ambulance was called, and upon her arrest, Sullivan was also found with wraps of cocaine in her handbag. She appeared at Chester Crown Court, where she was found guilty of assault and pleaded guilty to drug possession. The police condemned Sullivan's actions as "incomprehensible," highlighting the unprovoked nature of the attack.
