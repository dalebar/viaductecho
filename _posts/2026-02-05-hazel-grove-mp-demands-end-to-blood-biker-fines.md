Hazel Grove MP Lisa Smart is pushing to exempt emergency blood bike volunteers from fines when using bus lanes, aiming for them to be treated like ambulances and fire services. She's written to the Department of Transport, highlighting how Greater Manchester Blood Bikes operate around the clock, transporting vital medical items. Currently, the decision about blood bikers using bus lanes varies by council, causing confusion. In Stockport, on-duty volunteers can face £60 fines, with local regulations potentially costing £30,000 to change. Smart argues for a nationwide rule to prevent fines, eliminating the costly and inconsistent approach of individual councils. This move comes alongside a petition from a Cheshire Blood Bikes volunteer calling for blood bikers to use green emergency lights, which has gathered 35,000 signatures post a tragic accident involving a blood biker. The Nationwide Association of Blood Bikes supports the campaign but states that no special exemptions are on the table unless the government reconsiders their stance. Smart concludes it’s unjust for these volunteers to face fines while actively saving lives.
