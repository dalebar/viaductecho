Choosing where to live in Greater Manchester can really affect your property costs. House prices vary widely across the region, allowing your budget to stretch further in some areas than others. Currently, the average UK house price is around £270,000, and the type of property you can buy differs significantly depending on location. 

In the city centre, for example, you might snag a one-bed flat in a trendy area like Ancoats. Alternatively, in pricier areas like Altrincham, that same amount could land you a two-bed house. In Stockport, you might find a decent three-bed in Reddish, while Wigan offers more bang for your buck, with a four-bed semi-detached home available for the same price. Even Bolton presents options, like a four-bed detached home needing a bit of TLC. Each area has its charm and benefits, so it's worth weighing your options carefully!
