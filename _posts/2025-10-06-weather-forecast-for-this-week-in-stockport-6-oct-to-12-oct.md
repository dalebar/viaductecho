This week in Stockport starts off a bit wet but clears up nicely as we go along. Monday’s likely to kick off with rain and temperatures hitting 18°C, but it’ll get a bit breezier. Tuesday cools down a touch with cloudy skies, while Wednesday and Thursday keep things partly cloudy but pleasant. Temps will hover between 10°C and 16°C, with minimal chance of rain. 

By Friday, it stays partly cloudy, but the humidity’s higher at 89%. The weekend looks fab, with clear skies and gentle 4mph winds, perfect for outdoor escapades. Overall, expect mild temps ranging from 9°C to 18°C, with humidity dropping towards the weekend. Compared to last week, we're seeing less rain, so it's a good time for a stroll in the parks! Just remember, umbrellas might be handy early on!
