Andy Burnham's mayoral tax is set to rise by 20% in April, aiming to support 'forgotten and missed children'. The Greater Manchester leaders approved a 19.4% precept rise, leading to a typical band D home paying £25 more annually, bringing the total to £153.95. Opposition councillors have criticised the tax increases, especially the 44% hike for Burnham's office. Nonetheless, he argues that the funds will enhance residents' lives and maintain the Bee Network buses on schedule. 

Key initiatives include lifting the 9:30am restriction for older and disabled bus pass holders, extending the £2 bus fare cap to 2026, aiding drivers to upgrade their taxis, and providing free bus travel for homeless kids. Burnham highlighted the disruption faced by over 8,000 children in temporary accommodation, stressing the need for support. A £1,000 grant or £5,000 interest-free loan for taxi drivers is also planned to improve air quality. The budget, approved by council leaders except for one member, will come into effect in April, with lower band properties paying less.
