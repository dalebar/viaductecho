Andy Burnham has stepped forward to represent the Labour Party in the Gorton and Denton by-election, aiming to "fight the politics of Reform" and protect Greater Manchester from division. In a heartfelt BBC Radio Manchester interview, he expressed that he’s not abandoning his mayoral role but rather consolidating achievements made in the region. Despite being blocked by Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) due to cost concerns, Burnham emphasizes the importance of challenging Reform UK, viewing it as a threat to unity. He highlighted the need for electoral reform, including proportional representation and a new Senate, to truly represent Greater Manchester. While he plans to remain focused on his mayoral duties, he acknowledged the intensity of media scrutiny affecting his family and stated he would reflect on his future in the role. Burnham believes that the Labour Party needs to proactively counter challenges from Reform, describing the political climate as a serious crossroads similar to Brexit. With Reform selecting their candidate, the political landscape is heating up as other parties prepare for the contest.
