A woman abused by grooming gangs recounted being labelled a "vigilante" by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) when she tried to protect other children. GMP acknowledged that her treatment was unacceptable and inconsistent with the standards survivors should expect today. Ms Walker-Roberts and her husband faced criticism for their actions, which the police deemed "vigilante-style," fearing it could negatively affect future court cases. Her experience of being dismissed as a liar by social workers and police is corroborated by a 2022 independent review identifying her as “Sophie.” She has been instrumental in shaping national responses to the treatment of abuse survivors and has contributed to changes in sentencing guidelines. While only one man, Shakil Chowdhury, was convicted for her abuse, her advocacy work continues to highlight the failings of authorities in protecting vulnerable individuals. A GMP spokesman acknowledged the horrific abuse Ms Walker-Roberts suffered, emphasising the significant failures of the institutions that should have supported her.
