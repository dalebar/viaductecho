Tonight, six major roads in the Peak District are set to close as Storm Goretti rolls in, with heavy snowfall expected. Key routes including the A628 Woodhead Pass will shut at 8pm, affecting travel between Manchester and Sheffield. The A57 Snake Pass, a primary alternative, will also close from 6pm, along with the A54/A537 Cat and Fiddle, A6024 Holme Moss, A53 Axe Edge, and A5004 Long Hill. The closures will remain in place until it's safe to reopen them. An amber weather warning for snow kicks off at 8pm and lasts until 9am Friday, while a yellow warning affects eastern parts of Greater Manchester from 5pm today until midday Friday. Best to plan ahead if you're out and about!
