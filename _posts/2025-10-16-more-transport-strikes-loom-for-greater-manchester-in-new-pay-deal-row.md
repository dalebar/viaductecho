Travel bosses in Greater Manchester are facing potential disruptions with another eight strike dates as pay disputes escalate. This follows a recent agreement that ended major bus strikes involving First, Stagecoach, and Metroline. Now, staff at Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), represented by Unite and Unison, are set to strike starting Saturday, October 18, due to dissatisfaction over pay claims they say havenâ€™t changed since 2009. 

TfGM has offered a 3.2% pay rise and additional allowances, but the unions are pushing for a 9% increase and a four-day work week, which TfGM insists is unfeasible financially. Approximately 20% of TfGM's 1,300 staff, including office-based and frontline workers, could take part in the action. While some services may see reduced staff and temporary closures of facilities like toilets, bus and tram services should continue uninterrupted. Strike dates for Unite members stretch from October 18 to October 25, and Unison members are set to strike on October 30, November 5, and November 7. Both unions are open for further discussions to avert strikes.
