Market Street and Wellington Road in Bury were closed off on January 29 after a collision between a cyclist and a vehicle. Multiple police vehicles and ambulances were on-site. The cyclist was taken to hospital but fortunately suffered non-life threatening injuries. A 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop, and he remains in police custody. Pictures from the scene show a white vehicle with significant front bumper damage.
