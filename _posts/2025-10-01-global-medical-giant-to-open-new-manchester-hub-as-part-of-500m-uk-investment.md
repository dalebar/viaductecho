Convatec, a global medical company, is set to invest around £500 million in a new flagship R&D hub in Manchester, expected to open in 2027 at the Citylabs 4.0 facility. This investment forms part of a larger $1 billion commitment to research worldwide. The Manchester centre will focus on advanced wound, ostomy, continence, and infusion care, aiming to address unmet needs in chronic care. It will employ about 200 staff, mostly transferring from an existing site in Deeside, North Wales, with the potential for future growth. Importantly, no redundancies are planned; Deeside operations will continue, supporting manufacturing. Convatec’s leadership highlighted the significance of Manchester's vibrant life sciences ecosystem as a driving factor for choosing the location. The announcement is seen as a positive boost for the UK life sciences sector amidst recent uncertainty, alongside other significant investments from US-based firms. Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall described it as a landmark investment that will generate jobs and enhance healthcare outcomes.
