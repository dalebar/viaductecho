Bolton council taxpayers are facing a 4.99% council tax rise starting April 2026, confirmed in a recent council meeting. This hike is partly aimed at funding adult social care, with the average increase equating to about £1.19 a week for households. The council has approved a two-year budget that includes £7.8m in savings and uses £10.6m from reserves to balance the budget. Councillor Nick Peel highlighted investments in neighbourhood services and parks, with no cuts to street cleaning or highways. The Conservative opposition proposed a lower 2.99% increase, but it was rejected amid concerns over the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. The budget includes notable funding for smaller projects and improvements to cemeteries and parks, with support from the Liberal Democrats for these amendments. While central government funding has improved, there are still financial pressures that the council must navigate in the coming years.
