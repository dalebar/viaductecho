Heywood is set for a £20m uplift with plans for a revamped town square, civic centre, and improved shopfronts, under the government’s Pride in Place scheme. The proposal focuses on bolstering the local economy, enhancing green spaces, celebrating heritage, and improving safety. Initiatives aim to create more activities for young people and boost training opportunities. Currently, the Peine Square project near the civic centre is ongoing, with features like performance spaces and new seating soon to be complete. The Heywood Town Board, composed of residents, businesses, and council members, is hopeful that their plan will be approved by March next year. If adjustments are needed, the government will collaborate with them. Brian Davies, chair of the board, expressed confidence in the community-focused proposal, emphasising its potential to transform Heywood. A new website will be launched next year to keep residents updated on the plans.
