A young man, Jensen Westhead, tragically passed away after swallowing packages of cocaine before a flight from Manchester to Dubai. The 20-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room in Dubai on December 4, 2024. Lancashire Police reported that at least one of the packages burst in his stomach, leading to an overdose. Following his death, four people have been charged with drug-related offences, including conspiracy to evade drug export laws. Those charged include locals from Thornton Cleveleys and Denton. They're set to appear in court on October 31.
