This weekend, Manchester's city centre came alive with its annual Chinese New Year parade. Hundreds flocked to the streets for a lively celebration featuring live performances, delicious street food, and a grand procession. Kicking off at the Oxford Street and George Street junction, the dragon parade made its way to Chinatown, filled with vibrant sights like red lanterns and traditional dragon dances.

Dragons, seen as symbols of good luck and strength, chased away evil spirits, welcoming the prosperous Year of the Fire Horse, starting Tuesday, February 17. This colourful event, also known as Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, showcased acrobats, dancers, and drummers, making it a memorable day for all involved. Check out the stunning photos capturing the spirit of the celebrations across the city!
