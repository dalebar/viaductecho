A taxi driver, Rehan Mirza, had his licence revoked after illegally picking up a fare outside Old Trafford post a Manchester United match. He charged a fan and his son £35 for a four-mile trip to Piccadilly train station. The fan later reported him to Trafford Council, as private hire drivers can only take pre-booked passengers. An investigation revealed Mirza was illegally plying for fares and driving without insurance. He was found guilty at Manchester Magistrates Court on multiple charges, including illegally operating at a taxi rank. On September 19, he was fined £250, with additional costs of £400. Trafford Council's spokesperson emphasised their commitment to public safety and noted that only licensed Hackney vehicles can pick up passengers without a pre-booked fare at that location. They continue to patrol Old Trafford on match days to ensure compliance.
