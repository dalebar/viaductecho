UK Management College (UKMC), based in east Manchester, is celebrating its tenth anniversary and plans to attain university status. Founded in 2016 by Zahidul and Abida Islam, UKMC initially focused on providing educational opportunities for underrepresented groups and mature students. It has since grown to support 7,000 learners across several campuses in Greater Manchester and beyond, offering a diverse curriculum that includes partnerships with universities for degree programmes in fields like fashion and events management.

Professor Jason Powell highlighted that achieving university status is a long-term goal set out in their Transforming Lives Strategic Plan 2025-2030. The college prioritises collaboration with community organisations to develop courses that meet local needs. The new Salford campus, which opened in January, is strategically located near MediaCity, creating further opportunities for students.

UKMC is also hosting a Careers Fair on February 24, with industry exhibitors and activities aimed at helping students with job searches. Prof Powell emphasised the college's commitment to supporting socially disadvantaged students and fostering a sense of community empowerment.
