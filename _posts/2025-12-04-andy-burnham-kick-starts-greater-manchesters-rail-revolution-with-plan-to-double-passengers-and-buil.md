Greater Manchester’s rail revolution kicks off this weekend, with Mayor Andy Burnham aiming to double passenger numbers and pump £90bn into the local economy. The Bee Network will revamp travel by incorporating 96 commuter rail stations, allowing seamless transfers between trams, trains, and buses at lower fares. Starting December 7, ticket prices will drop by an average of 5%, making trains competitively priced against cars. By next year, passengers on certain lines will use tap-and-go tech for ticketing, similar to buses and trams. Alongside the transport improvements, Burnham plans to build 75,000 homes on unused land owned by Network Rail, with a focus on Ashton and Stalybridge as key areas for growth. Though some in the rail industry see the plans as ambitious, Burnham assures there's strong support from rail figures and a commitment to collaboration. However, elements like a proposed new underground Piccadilly station remain a long-term aspiration rather than an immediate reality.
