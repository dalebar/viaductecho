Bolton council taxpayers are set to see a 4.99% increase in their bills from April next year. A consultation on this proposed rise for the 2026-2027 financial year runs from December 15 to January 12, 2026. This follows a two-year budget approved in February 2025, which anticipated the rise amidst rising demand and costs for vital services like care for vulnerable adults and community regeneration projects. Although the council acknowledges the burden on household budgets, they emphasise the importance of feedback as they aim for a balanced budget without imposing further cuts to services. If the rise goes through, it would increase a typical band D household's annual bill by about £113. The council, while under financial pressure, noted an improvement in its financial situation due to better-than-expected government funding but still plans to use £17.4 million from cash reserves to support the budget.
