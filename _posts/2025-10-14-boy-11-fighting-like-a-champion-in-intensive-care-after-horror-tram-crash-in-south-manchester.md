His parents shared that he's in an induced coma, having undergone multiple surgeries, but remains strong, fighting like a champion. There's been an incredible outpouring of support from the community, with a motocross club raising over Â£7,000 to help his family while they stay by his side. The incident has prompted Transport for Greater Manchester and other agencies to investigate, seeking witnesses and any footage. The family has expressed gratitude for the love and support received, asking for space as they navigate this challenging time.
