Zack Polanski, the Green Party leader, has slammed Labour, claiming they've "blown it" in Gorton and Denton, suggesting a Green victory could signal the end of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. With the by-election on February 26, Polanski believes his candidate, Hannah Spencer, a local plumber, could become the party's first MP in Greater Manchester. He expressed frustration at Starmer's lack of serious engagement and highlighted the Greens' momentum, pointing to their active campaigning and strong community support. Labour, however, maintains they’re still in the race, dismissing claims of a two-horse battle. Polanski also noted the backlash Spencer has faced online, framing her as a symbol of grassroots politics against a tide of toxicity. He believes many voters are disillusioned with Labour, especially amid recent scandals. Ultimately, Polanski sees a potential Green win as a significant shift in the political landscape, reflecting a demand for genuine representation over the status quo.
