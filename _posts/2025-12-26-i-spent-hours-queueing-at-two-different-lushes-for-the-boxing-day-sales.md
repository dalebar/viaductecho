This Boxing Day, the Arndale Centre in Manchester had a quiet start, except for one buzzing spot—Lush. Just before it opened, a long queue formed, with eager shoppers like Debbie, who started queuing at 8am to score half-price bath bombs and festive goodies. Debbie, a regular at these sales, prefers in-store shopping to dodge online mishaps. Lush's popularity stems from its partial offline-only deals, unlike many other retailers who have shifted online. Store manager Chloe Dudek noted the consistent rush every Boxing Day, attributing it to the appealing products and generous discounts—up to 50% off—which draw in crowds. Although other shops started slow, foot traffic picked up by noon, with many delighted customers heading home with their finds, Lush continuing to steal the spotlight.
