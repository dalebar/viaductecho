The evacuation at Manchester Arndale's food court was prompted by the discovery of a 'suspicious dark powder substance' on January 7, leading to shoppers being asked to leave for safety. Emergency services, including police and fire crews, arrived around 6pm to investigate. Thankfully, it was confirmed that the substance was harmless powder from a hand warmer sachet, posing no threat to the public. The area was deemed safe, and the Arndale Centre was fully reopened shortly after. Greater Manchester Police thanked everyone for their cooperation during the incident.
