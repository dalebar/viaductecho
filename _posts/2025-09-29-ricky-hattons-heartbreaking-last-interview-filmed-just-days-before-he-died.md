Ricky Hatton, renowned boxing champ, shared his wish to be remembered as "one of the boys" in his final podcast just days before his death at 46 on September 14. The heartfelt interview, recorded four days prior, highlights his memories of rising from the Hattersley estate to becoming a beloved figure in boxing. Ricky reflected on his deep connection with fans, comparing himself to fellow boxing favourite Frank Bruno. He candidly opened up about his struggles with depression, revealing how he hid his feelings from loved ones until he sought help. He cherished his famous 2005 victory over Kostya Tszyu, marking a turning point in his life while keeping close ties with his roots and lifelong mates. A memorial celebrating Ricky's legacy is scheduled for October 10 at Manchester Cathedral, honouring the impact he had both in and out of the ring.
