Over 42,000 runners are all set for the Manchester Marathon on 19 April, making it the UK's second largest marathon after London. The event sold out months in advance, and last year saw around 36,000 participants cheered on by massive crowds. 

Starting at the E2 Car Park at Old Trafford, the 26.2-mile course runs through South Manchester, looping past Sale and Altrincham before finishing on Oxford Road. Though exact timings are yet to be confirmed, elite runners kicked off at 09:00 BST last year, with others following in waves thereafter. 

Travelling to the marathon? Trams start from 07:00 BST, and Metrolink services will be running. Driving is discouraged due to road closures, but a limited number of pre-bookable parking spaces at Manchester United are available for around £20. Spectators can find various car parks near the finish, plus Park and Ride options with free parking when using a Metrolink ticket. For more transport details, check the Transport for Greater Manchester website.
