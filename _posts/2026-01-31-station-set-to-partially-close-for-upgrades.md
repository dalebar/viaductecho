Manchester Piccadilly is set for a partial closure as it undergoes vital upgrades from 14 February for nine days. While platforms 13 and 14 will still operate, services to London, the Midlands, and the East will be halted. Network Rail, which oversees the station, stresses that these long-overdue improvements are crucial as existing infrastructure dates back to the 1980s, causing frequent faults that can disrupt services across the North West. Rebecca Rathore from Network Rail acknowledged the inconvenience to passengers but emphasised the necessity of the work. Piccadilly station and its Metrolink will remain open, and travellers are urged to check services before setting off. The £7.9 million project includes replacing 11 sets of points and updating equipment, with around 70-80 staff working overnight to complete it on time.
