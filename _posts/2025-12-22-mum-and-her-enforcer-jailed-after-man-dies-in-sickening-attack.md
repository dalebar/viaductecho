A mother, Jemma Marshall, and her accomplice, Jason Wadsworth, were sentenced for the manslaughter of Martin Shaw, who died after a brutal assault as they attempted to collect a debt. Shaw, 45, was lured into Marshall's Audi in Oldham, where he was attacked before being driven home. Although police were called, Shaw didn't immediately seek medical help and later died from serious injuries, including a ruptured spleen and fractured ribs. Both defendants claimed Shaw owed money for drugs, but the court heard that neither physically forced him into the car. They were found guilty after a month-long trial—Marshall received four-and-a-half years, while Wadsworth was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years, plus an extra two years for being a "dangerous" offender. Shaw's brother described him as a kind man trying to overcome addiction. The judge highlighted that the attack aimed to 'teach him a lesson' for not paying off his debts, with prosecutors stating Shaw was an easy target exploited by both defendants.
