Middleton is set to lose its last bank, with Halifax confirming it will close on January 8, 2026. This follows the closure of Natwest earlier this year. The decision stems from a shift in customer banking habits, favouring online and mobile services over physical visits. Although in-person banking is winding down, locals can still access a Barclays pop-up at the Lighthouse Project Community Hub three days a week. Meanwhile, plans have been submitted to transform the vacant Natwest into a Church of God, with a focus on maintaining the area's character and contributing positively to the community. The church has a global presence, rooted in the late 19th-century Holiness or Pentecostal movements. It's a significant change for Middleton, marking the end of an era for traditional banking.
