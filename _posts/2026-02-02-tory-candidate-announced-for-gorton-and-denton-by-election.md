The Conservative party has picked former police officer Charlotte Cadden as their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election on February 26, following MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation. Cadden emphasised key issues like local schools, the NHS, and policing, proposing policies such as removing mobile phones from schools and scrapping the carbon tax. Labour’s candidate is Manchester city councillor Angeliki Stogia, while Reform has Matt Goodwin and the Liberal Democrats have Jackie Pearcey. Despite Labour previously winning the seat with over half the vote, changing public sentiment since 2024, including Keir Starmer's low popularity, could affect voter decisions this time around.
