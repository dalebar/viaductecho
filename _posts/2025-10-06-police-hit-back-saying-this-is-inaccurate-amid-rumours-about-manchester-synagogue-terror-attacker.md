Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has stated that the synagogue attacker, Jahid Al-Shamie, has not previously been reported for extremist behaviour, contrary to some circulating reports. GMP insists this information is inaccurate and reaffirms that Al-Shamie was not known to counter-terrorism police. The statement was released following a tragic attack on October 2, which resulted in the deaths of Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz and left three others injured. The investigation into the attack is ongoing, with several suspects being detained under terrorism-related charges. A police watchdog is also reviewing the use of lethal force by GMP's firearms officers during the incident. Meanwhile, Al-Shamie's past is under scrutiny, including allegations of abusive behaviour towards a former partner who claimed he influenced her extreme views.
