Residents in east Manchester, particularly on Briscoe Lane, are struggling after a burst pipe caused a large sinkhole and disrupted water supply. Since February 10, many homes have faced issues like no water or low pressure, leaving some unable to heat their homes. United Utilities is on-site making repairs and has provided water tanks to help out. However, locals are frustrated, with one business owner losing trade due to the road closure. The company has apologised for the inconvenience and is working quickly to resolve the situation. Manchester City Council is also aware of the incident. Keep an eye on updates from local news sources for more info!
