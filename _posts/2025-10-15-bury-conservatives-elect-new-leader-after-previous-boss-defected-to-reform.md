Bury council's Conservative group has a new leader, Shabaz Arif, following Jack Rydeheard's defection to Reform. Arif, a councillor for Bury West, steps in after a turbulent year for the Conservatives, where several members, including former leaders Russell Bernstein and Jo Lancaster, left due to party divisions. The group is now down to just five councillors. Arif expressed his gratitude for the role and emphasised the need for a united opposition that advocates for local issues, particularly affordable housing and environmental protection. He highlighted his commitment to supporting small businesses and enhancing Bury as a great place to live, work, and invest, with Coun Jackie Harris serving as his deputy.
