On Boxing Day, a homeless man named Anthony Horn was found dead in Manchester city centre, possibly due to severe cold. The city council has protocols, like the Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP), to help rough sleepers during harsh winters. They set up emergency accommodation and increase outreach, but some homeless individuals refuse help, often citing inadequate conditions like having to sit in chairs instead of sleeping. 

Many prefer to stay outside, claiming the lack of space and risks of shared facilities deter them from accepting assistance. Some emergency spaces are only available during extreme weather, while permanent accommodation is offered year-round. The council has seen a relatively lower refusal rate since activating SWEP, acknowledging that many who refuse help face complex issues. 

Deputy Council Leader Cllr Joanna Midgley emphasized the need for compassion in understanding choices made by rough sleepers, encouraging continued support and engagement. The council provides contact numbers for outreach services to help those in need.
