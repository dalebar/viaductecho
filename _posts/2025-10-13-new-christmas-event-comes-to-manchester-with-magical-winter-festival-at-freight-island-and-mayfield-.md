Manchester's gearing up for a festive treat with the return of Winter Island and the new Twilight Tales event. Set in Freight Island’s heated courtyard, this immersive experience will dazzle families with storytelling and sensory fun, kicking off on November 13. Tickets start at just £5 for kids and £8 for adults, with family deals available too.

Visitors will enter through an enchanted garden with a giant storybook, surrounded by a sparkling Christmas tree forest. Throughout the journey, Santa's cheeky elves will be hiding, and spotting all ten could land you a festive prize. The adventure features magical installations like the Smokey Tunnel, Icicle Cave, Spirograph Tunnel, and the dazzling Mirrorball Cave.

After exploring, families can enjoy The North Pole Playground, hop on The Twilight Express for a fun ride, and gather around a firepit with hot drinks and craft activities in Santa's Workshop. Winter Island is the perfect festive destination just a short walk from Manchester Piccadilly. Be sure to grab your tickets ahead of time for a truly enchanting experience!
