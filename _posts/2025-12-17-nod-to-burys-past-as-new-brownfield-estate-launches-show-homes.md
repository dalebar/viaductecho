A new housing estate called Scholar’s Park has been launched on the former Radcliffe Riverside School site, now set to feature 90 homes. The project, developed by Hive Homes, was kick-started by an £882,000 funding boost from the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in 2022, allowing for necessary site preparation. Scholar’s Park includes 68 homes for private sale and 22 affordable plots. Councillor Clare Cummins highlighted the development as part of Radcliffe's regeneration, aligning with plans for a new high school and Radcliffe Hub set to open in 2026. As part of a Section 106 Agreement, Hive Homes is also contributing £246,000 for local facility improvements, including nearby play areas and sports facilities. Ed Milner from Hive Homes expressed pride in contributing to the community's growth and looks forward to welcoming residents in 2026.
