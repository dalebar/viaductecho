Greater Manchester Police are prepared to intervene if protests planned for this weekend become violent or threatening, following a recent anti-Semitic attack that left two people dead at a Crumpsall synagogue. Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson has highlighted the need for peaceful gatherings and urged organisers of a pro-Palestine march, titled 'two years of genocide', and a 'Manchester stands with Israel' march to consider the sensitive timing. While police cannot stop peaceful protests, they will act decisively against any violence or intimidation. Sir Stephen is appealing to the community’s sense of decency and urging people to join in vigils instead as a means of respectful reflection during this difficult time for the city’s Jewish community. The police will ensure a strong presence to offer reassurance, aiming to keep the city secure and welcoming.
