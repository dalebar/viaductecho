The nominees for this year's Bafta Rising Star award have been revealed, showcasing some promising acting talent in the film industry. The winner will be announced at the Bafta Film Awards in February. 

Among the nominees is Hull's Aramayo for his role in *I Swear*, where he portrays a young man with Tourette's syndrome in the 1980s. Caton, just 20, is making waves with his performance in *Sinners*, already bagging a Critics' Choice Award and a nomination for best supporting actor. 

Infiniti takes a notable turn in *One Battle After Another* alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, playing Willa, the strong-willed daughter of a revolutionary. Madekwe gets a nod for his performance in *Lurker*, a psychological thriller about a pop star facing blackmail. 

Lastly, Manchester's own Sterling is recognised for her role in *Lollipop*, where she plays a single mum fighting for her kids after prison. The rest of the Bafta nominations will be unveiled on 27 January.
