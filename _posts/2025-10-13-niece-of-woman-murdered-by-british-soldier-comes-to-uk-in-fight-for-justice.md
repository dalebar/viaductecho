Esther Njoki, the niece of Agnes Wanjiru—who was tragically killed in 2012 and found in a septic tank near a British Army base—has come to the UK to advocate for justice for all women wronged by British soldiers. She’s meeting Defence Secretary John Healey to push for the extradition of the alleged murderer, Robert James Purkiss, from Greater Manchester. Esther expressed her desire to give a voice to vulnerable women in Kenya who have suffered abuse, noting that many cases go unnoticed. She believes British soldiers exploit their presence in Kenya, taking advantage of the situation. Key issues she plans to address with Healey include ensuring accountability for the delayed investigation into her aunt’s murder and preventing soldiers from leaving their bases during training in Kenya. Esther's visit aims to highlight these serious concerns and advocate for systemic changes in how such cases are managed.
