Rochdale's pubs are pouring a new cask ale called 'Signo', celebrating the town's status as Greater Manchester Town of Culture. This refreshing 4.5% golden ale has a sweet taste with hints of peach, apricot, and gentle citrus, finishing off with a delicate herbal note. The name 'Signo', meaning 'Trust in this sign' in Latin, is inspired by Rochdale's coat of arms. A collaboration between local brewers, including Wakey Wakey Brew Company and Twisted Mule Brewery, this beer embodies the community spirit Rochdale is known for. Coun Sue Smith, along with representatives from CAMRA and local organisations, helped launch 'Signo', highlighting the town's vibrant cultural identity. You can currently find 'Signo' available in several pubs and bars across the borough. Cheers!
