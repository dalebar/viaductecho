Police in Oldham are appealing for help in finding a missing woman named Margaret. She was last seen on Hollins Road around 9pm on Sunday, October 5. At 33 years old, Margaret is described as a black female of medium build and 'very short' stature, with black hair. She was wearing a white dress at the time of her disappearance. Officers are growing increasingly concerned for her safety and have shared her photo on the GMP Oldham Facebook page. If anyone has information about her whereabouts, they should call GMP on 101 and reference log 3614 of 05/10/2025.
