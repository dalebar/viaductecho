Wigan Council is selling off a 7.7-acre green space near Lovers Lane in Atherton for residential development. They're looking for interested developers and state the site is ‘under offer,’ meaning a developer's bid has likely been accepted but the sale isn’t finalised yet. This plot is part of a wider marketing effort for seven council-owned sites, including former locations like an old ambulance station and the Bellingham Hotel. The Lovers Lane site is positioned well within the Wigan and Bolton growth corridor, close to schools, leisure facilities, and essential transport links like the A579 and M61. The council describes the site as a prime opportunity for residential development in a well-established area. Other sites on the market are also highlighted as excellent development prospects that may require careful ecological consideration due to existing mature trees and vegetation.
