Manchester Airport is gearing up for the finishing touches on its Â£1.3 billion transformation programme, with Luxair transferring to Terminal 2 on September 22. This airline will connect Manchester to Luxembourg, and passengers will receive updates directly. The switch follows Aer Lingus, which has now moved all its operations to the revamped terminal as of September 16. Terminal 2 is set to double in size upon completion, which is expected by year's end, and features new hotspots like the Lego shop, Joe and The Juice, and Pandora. With over 70% of airport passengers expected to use these facilities, the original Terminal 2 is getting a makeover to match its extension. Also, Terminal 1 is closing soon, making way for more exciting outlets like Chanel and a food court with street food options. Meanwhile, plans for a major revamp of Terminal 3 are underway, promising extra seating, enhanced security, and a new sports bar called Sporting Chance.
