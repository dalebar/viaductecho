A dodgy double glazing boss, Steven Wright, set up a new company, The Cheshire Window Outlet, after being banned from doing so. Complaints from customers about unpaid deposits triggered an investigation by Stockport Councilâ€™s Trading Standards Team. Despite two previous disqualification orders, he used his wife Louise and a mate, Mark Tibbot, as directors. Once they fled to Florida in 2023, warrants for their arrests were issued. A trial took place in their absence, leading to Steven being convicted of fraud and breaching disqualifications, while Louise was found guilty of aiding him. The company also faced convictions. Tibbot, who had initially gone missing, was later caught and received a 12-week suspended sentence. Stockport Council expressed their commitment to protecting residents and holding dishonest businesses accountable.
