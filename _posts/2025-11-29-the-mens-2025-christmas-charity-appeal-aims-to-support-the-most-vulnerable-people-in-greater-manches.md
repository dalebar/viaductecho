As freezing temperatures return to Manchester, life’s getting tougher for those struggling the most. The cold hits the homeless hard, but many others are at risk of financial crisis as bills pile up. This year, the MEN's Christmas appeal is supporting Mustard Tree, a charity providing vital help to people facing poverty. With record numbers seeking assistance, Mustard Tree offers food schemes, a welcoming café, and a community store that features discounted essentials. They also run classes to build job skills, helping nearly 100 people find work this year. In 2025 alone, they helped 350 people secure homes and supported 700 families with essential furnishings. They're aiming to raise £10,000 this winter, but if you can’t donate money, they welcome items like furniture, clothing, bedding, and toys for their toy drive. You can check their winter wish list on their website too. Every little bit helps!
