Construction has kicked off for two blocks of affordable apartments near Stockport town centre, specifically on Chestergate close to King Street West. This Â£41m project will feature two eight-storey buildings with a total of 148 units, including 59 one-bedroom and 89 two-bedroom apartments. All homes will be designated as affordable, available through rent-to-buy or social rent options, with the rent-to-buy scheme offering a 20% reduction on market rates for five years to help tenants eventually buy their homes.

The design is inspired by Stockport's industrial heritage and includes plans for a green pedestrian link to the River Mersey. The developer, Great Places, recently hosted a site visit with local officials, highlighting the importance of affordable housing in the area. With over 1,000 enquiries already, there's a strong interest in these homes. Local leaders emphasised their commitment to town centre regeneration and ensuring inclusivity for residents at all life stages.
