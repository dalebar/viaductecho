Hans Zimmer concluded The Next Level tour in Manchester on December 2, praising the city as “IT”. During the three-hour show at Co-op Live, he introduced his guitarist, Nile Marr, son of Manc legend Johnny Marr, delighting the audience. Zimmer, at 68, led a diverse and talented band through a full range of his iconic film scores, turning the stage into a high-energy spectacle rather than a traditional orchestral performance. The night included collaborations with artists like Loire Cotler, Lisa Gerrard, and Lebo M, showcasing the emotional depth of Zimmer's music. He shared personal stories behind his compositions, including a piece from Interstellar inspired by a letter from Christopher Nolan. The performance featured stunning visuals, including a trapeze artist and dynamic staging, blending rock and cinematic elements. As the show wrapped up with the Pirates of the Caribbean theme, it left the crowd mesmerised, embodying the passion and history of Zimmer’s extraordinary musical journey.
