Shabana Mahmood, chair of Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC), has responded positively to Andy Burnham's request to stand in the Gorton and Denton by-election. Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, expressed his interest in returning to Westminster after current MP Andrew Gwynne announced his resignation due to health issues. Burnham needs NEC approval to enter the selection process, with a deadline for applications set for this Sunday. Mahmood praised Burnham as a "fantastic mayor" and stated she will remain impartial as chair during the NEC discussions. If Burnham's candidacy goes ahead, he must secure local party support and, if elected, would have to resign as mayor due to legal obligations surrounding his dual roles. The by-election might coincide with local elections on May 7.
