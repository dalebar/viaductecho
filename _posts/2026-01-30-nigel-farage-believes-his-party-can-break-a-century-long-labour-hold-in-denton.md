Nigel Farage visited Denton today, rallying support for the Reform UK party alongside by-election candidate Matt Goodwin. The atmosphere was lively, with motorists honking and locals giving thumbs-up. Farage addressed campaigners, claiming the upcoming by-election in Labour's long-held stronghold offers a chance for change. He promised multiple visits, saying Reform is the “party of hope” ready to tackle Britain’s issues, unlike others who deny there's a problem. 

Local café manager Leigha Manser was pleasantly surprised by Farage's casual visit for coffee and believes Reform can handle key community problems like crime. The campaign walk was marked by support from passing vehicles, though fewer locals engaged in conversation compared to previous events. Farage expressed confidence in winning the seat, especially after Labour’s Andy Burnham was blocked from running. 

Goodwin highlighted his local ties, defending against criticism over his connections to the area. He insisted many residents feel neglected by Labour and are keen for representation that listens to their needs. Goodwin vowed to restore the area's significance in Westminster if elected.
