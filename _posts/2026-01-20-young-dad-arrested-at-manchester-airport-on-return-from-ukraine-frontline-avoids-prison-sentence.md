Cameron Macfarlane, a 25-year-old dad from Burscough, has avoided jail after being convicted of abusing his ex-partner. He received a 12-month community order for violent behaviour, including shoving her and crushing her fingers in a door, which required hospital treatment. Their relationship began in 2018 and quickly escalated into aggression. The victim described the toll it took on her, feeling vulnerable and manipulated, even fearing for her life. While Macfarlane served in Ukraine, she reported his behaviour to the police, leading to his arrest upon his return. He initially denied the allegations but later admitted to coercive behaviour. In court, Macfarlane's troubled childhood and struggles with depression and PTSD were taken into account, along with his youth. The judge acknowledged his immaturity and lack of prior convictions, sentencing him to a community order and a seven-year restraining order to stay away from her.
