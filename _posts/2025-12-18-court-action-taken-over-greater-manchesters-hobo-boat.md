The 'hobo boat' on the Bridgewater Canal is now shut down after Trafford Council took legal action due to ongoing anti-social behaviour linked to the vessel. The boat, moored near Edge Lane Bridge, was home to a group of class A drug users, prompting reports of fighting, drug use, harassment, and a dangerous dog running loose. Concerns about safety escalated when the boat slipped its moorings, blocking the canal and necessitating an emergency response. Magistrates agreed to two closure orders for both the boat and the adjoining wharf, with support from Greater Manchester Police. The narrowboat will be moved to a safe spot, and the wharf will be locked and monitored with CCTV. Cllr Rose Thompson expressed satisfaction with the decision to curb crime and restore safety in the area.
