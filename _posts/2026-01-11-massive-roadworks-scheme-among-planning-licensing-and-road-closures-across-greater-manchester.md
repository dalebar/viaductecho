This week in Greater Manchester, a new padel club is on the horizon for Ashton Cricket Club, adding to the area's growing facilities for the sport. Meanwhile, in Bury, a major roadworks scheme is closing Market Street until June 26, making way for new cycle lanes and crossing signals, though diversions will be in place. Nearby, the remnants of a Victorian villa, Doe Hey House, have led to proposals for its replacement after being partially demolished without planning permission. In the city centre, plans for a 14-storey office block called "One North Parade" are in the works, set to replace dilapidated Victorian warehouses alongside Parsonage Gardens. Rochdale is making strides on a significant energy storage project, which aims to support local energy needs and prevent blackouts. Lastly, road layout changes are set to commence in Tameside as part of a larger project linking Manchester and Sheffield, with updates expected till 2028. Lots happening around the region!
