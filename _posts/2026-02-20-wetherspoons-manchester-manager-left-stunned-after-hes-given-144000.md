George Derbyshire, a Wetherspoons manager from Manchester, recently won £144,000 from the Postcode Lottery just five months after signing up on a whim at a bus stop. The 33-year-old, a big Manchester United and Salford City fan, is set to receive £12,000 each month for a year. Excited about the win, he plans to renew his passport and finally visit Rome, where he studied ancient history. Alongside treating himself, he’s also keen to spoil his family, including a trip to the Lake District for his brothers. His win shines a light on charity work, as he’s previously raised funds for Alzheimer’s research, a cause close to his heart. Another lucky winner, neighbour Jason Brennan, also celebrated his good fortune with plans for a Caribbean cruise for his mum. Both are thrilled with their wins and eager to continue playing the lottery. George quipped he might even grab a new pair of running shoes with his winnings!
