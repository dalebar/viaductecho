Trade union leader Maryam Eslamdoust has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to resign if Labour comes third in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election, suggesting Angela Rayner as a credible replacement. Eslamdoust, head of the TSSA, said a leadership challenge could arise soon after the election, which poses a risk of Labour falling behind Reform UK and the Greens. She praised Rayner for her strong leadership qualities and ability to connect with working-class communities, despite her recent scandal involving unpaid stamp duty. While Eslamdoust advocates for a broader range of leadership candidates, a spokesperson for Rayner indicated that there’s no current contest for leadership. Eslamdoust's comments follow Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar’s call for Starmer to step down amidst ongoing controversies. Starmer, however, remains determined to lead Labour forward and has the support of his Cabinet and Rayner. The by-election is set for February 26, adding to the pressure on Starmer as the party faces significant challenges.
