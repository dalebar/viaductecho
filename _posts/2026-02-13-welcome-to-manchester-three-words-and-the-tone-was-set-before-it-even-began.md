The recent hustings for the Gorton and Denton by-election, held by the Manchester Evening News, set a fiery tone with candidates from Labour, Reform UK, and the Greens trading heated barbs. Matt Goodwin from Reform arrived last, aided by a bodyguard, and received pointed remarks from rivals about his lack of local ties. Green candidate Hannah Spencer slammed him for promoting division, while Labour’s Angeliki Stogia challenged his rhetoric and its impact on local communities. Goodwin defended his security measures and attacked Labour’s policies. The debate featured clash over housing strategies, with Spencer criticising Labour’s planning approach and Stogia advocating for affordable homes. Despite their differences, the candidates found some common ground over music, notably Oasis. With varying perspectives on community issues, the contest is a crucial moment for the diverse constituency, highlighting the need for unity among its 70,000 residents as they prepare to vote on February 27.
