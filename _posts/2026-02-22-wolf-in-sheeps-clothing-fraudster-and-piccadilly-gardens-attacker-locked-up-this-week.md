This week in Greater Manchester, a few criminals faced justice for serious offences. Richard Shaw, a council worker dubbed a 'wolf in sheep's clothing', swindled £900,000 from vulnerable benefit claimants, using the money for lavish holidays and luxury cars. He got a prison sentence of 4 years and 8 months. Then there's Said Sadat, who stabbed a man in the neck with a broken bottle during an argument in Piccadilly Gardens over a debt. He received a sentence of 3 years and 9 months for his violent assault. Lastly, Stuart Wilson was caught driving over 100mph on the M6 and, rather nervously, revealed to police that there was "something in the boot" of his BMW. This 'something' turned out to be 25kg of cocaine worth around £2.5 million, leading to a 5-year prison term for him. These cases highlight the ongoing efforts of local law enforcement to tackle crime in the community, ensuring safety for residents.
