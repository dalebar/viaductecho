Two-year-old Jude from Manchester is turning heads in local pubs with his impressive snooker skills, thanks to his dad, Luke, who introduced him to the game. Luke, who grew up playing snooker, bought Jude a mini table, and it quickly became clear that Jude has a natural talent for the sport. They've shared videos online, racking up viral moments and enthusiastic reactions from onlookers.
