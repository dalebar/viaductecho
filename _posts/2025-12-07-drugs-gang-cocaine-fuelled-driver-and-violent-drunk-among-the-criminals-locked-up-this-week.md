This week in Greater Manchester, a series of serious cases led to the jailing of various criminals. Notably, a drugs gang run by Bobby Vernon and his uncle Darren Rae was dismantled. They operated a sophisticated operation dealing in large quantities of heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and amphetamines across the north west alongside others involved in the logistics. Meanwhile, Abdul Khaliq, 32, was sentenced for dangerous driving after crashing into a BMW while under the influence of cocaine, leaving a passenger seriously injured. Lastly, David Croly, 42, was jailed for a violent outburst at Banyan bar after being denied access to the toilets. After striking a staff member, he caused a scene, resulting in wounds to an unfortunate bystander. Overall, these cases highlight a busy week in the local courts as justice is served for various offences.
