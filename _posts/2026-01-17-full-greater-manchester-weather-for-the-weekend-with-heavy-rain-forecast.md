This week has brought milder temperatures to Greater Manchester after a chilly start to January. Saturday will kick off cloudy with light showers but should brighten up in the afternoon, with highs of 8C to 9C. However, breezy 12mph winds will make it feel more like 5C. Tonight's lows will be around 5C, possibly dropping to 3C, but no frost is expected—just keep that blanket handy for the chill! 

Sunday starts off foggy and misty, with rain set to move in, especially by 9am, impacting Greater Manchester and the surrounding areas throughout the day. Expect cooler temperatures around 7C and possibly some hail near Bolton and Rochdale later. As night falls, temps might dip to about 4C. 

Looking at Monday, it’ll be a mixed bag with the chance of rain and showers, but also some bright spells. It’ll remain mild without frost, though breezy conditions may make it feel cooler, so best to wrap up!
