Paige Oldfield, originally from Prestwich, moved to Toronto in March 2025 with her fiancé Robbie. She was warned about Canadian winters, but nothing quite prepared her for the intense cold, often feeling colder than it ever did in Manchester. With temperatures regularly dropping to –24°C, she now considers anything above –12°C a good day. The dry Canadian cold has surprisingly improved Robbie's eczema, a stark contrast to the damp winter chills back home. Heating in Canada is constant, making life more comfortable compared to their previous energy rationing. Toronto is well-equipped for winter life, featuring insulated homes, underground walkways, and consistently operational public transport, even in heavy snow. Paige has adapted her wardrobe for the cold and appreciates the communal support in winter, from clearing snow to warming centres for those in need. Unlike the UK, where a little snow brings everything to a halt, Canadians embrace winter sports and activities, making the season a regular part of life. Now, a day without snow feels odd to her.
