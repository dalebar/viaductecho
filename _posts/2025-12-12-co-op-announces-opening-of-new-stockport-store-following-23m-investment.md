The Co-op's Great Moor store in Stockport has officially re-opened today, December 12, after undergoing a £2.3 million facelift that included tearing down the old store. The newly revamped 4,600 sq ft space now boasts a wider range of fresh and healthy foods, meal deals, fairtrade items, flowers, and even a Costa Coffee Express. Convenient features like EV charging points, Amazon and DPD parcel collection, and InPost Lockers make it a handy stop for locals. Paul Griffin, Operations Manager, expressed excitement about the new offerings and the store's commitment to the community. Plus, there’s a soft plastic recycling facility for items like crisp packets and biscuit wrappers. The new store is open daily from 7 am to 10 pm and marks part of the Co-op’s larger plan to refurbish around 50 stores nationwide leading up to Christmas.
