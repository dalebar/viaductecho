In Rochdale, six shops have been shut down in recent months due to illegal trading activities. Most recently, three stores—World of Shisha, Green Shop, and Darnhill Discount Store—were closed by the courts for repeatedly selling illicit tobacco and counterfeit goods. The council and Greater Manchester Police supported these actions as part of Operation Tetbury, aimed at improving community safety. 

World of Shisha was linked to illegal tobacco supplies from nearby locations and had opened shortly after another shop was closed. Darnhill Discount Store attracted anti-social behaviour while trading counterfeit dolls, and Green Shop was found with illegal vapes and employed an illegal worker. The council is determined to continue cracking down on these illegal activities and is gathering evidence against more shops. Coun Trica Ayrton emphasised the importance of quick actions against such unlawful practices and warned that the authorities are actively monitoring the situation to ensure compliance on the high streets.
