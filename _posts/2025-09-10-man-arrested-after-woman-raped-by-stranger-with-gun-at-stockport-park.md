A man from Manchester has been arrested after a woman reported being raped in Heaton Mersey Park, Stockport, around 9:30pm on September 9. The woman claims a man approached her, allegedly holding what she thought could be a firearm, and forced her to go with him to the park. She managed to escape and sought safety, prompting the arrest of a 28-year-old man about an hour later. Police are examining the firearm mentioned and have boosted patrols in the area for community reassurance. Superintendent Dave Henthorne noted that stranger rape is rare in Greater Manchester, and the focus is on supporting the victim, recognising her bravery in coming forward. Witnesses are encouraged to contact the police for further details.
