A 70-year-old man, Graham Alston, died after being punched twice in the face by a younger resident at Hulton House care home in Lancashire. Mr Alston, who had dementia, was simply trying to hold the younger man's hand when he was attacked. The puncher, who had a brain injury and a history of aggression, was noted to be "inappropriately placed" in the dementia facility, as Hulton House struggled to meet his needs. Concerns about this mismatch arose quickly, but confusion over NHS commissioning responsibilities delayed identifying a suitable placement. After the assault on November 2, 2022, Mr Alston initially seemed unharmed but later showed signs of a serious brain injury and sadly passed away on November 8. The coroner, Kate Bisset, highlighted the need for better communication and clarity regarding care placements to prevent similar tragedies, noting that such bureaucratic delays could endanger vulnerable residents. Despite considerations for a criminal charge against the attacker, none was pursued.
