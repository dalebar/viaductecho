This weekend in Stockport is buzzing with events! Kick off with **Bop & Bingo** at Hazel Grove Social Club on Friday (12 September) for a lively twist on bingo with music and drag. Then on Saturday (13 September), check out the **Bramhall Wellness Day** in the Village Square, featuring free exercise classes, wellness treatments, and local market stalls, along with family activities. On the same day, celebrate 30 years of **Pride and Prejudice** at Lyme Park, where visitors can dress up and relive iconic scenes from Austen's classic. If you fancy some theatre, catch **Quartet** at Chads Theatre, running until 13 Septemberâ€”it's a hilarious exploration of aging through music. Finally, wrap up your weekend with **Proms in the Park** at High Lea Park on Sunday (14 September), where the New Mills Brass Band will perform some classic tunes. Grab your tickets online or at local shops. Enjoy your weekend!
