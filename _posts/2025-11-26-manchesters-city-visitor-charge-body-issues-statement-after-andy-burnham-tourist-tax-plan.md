Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, is set to gain the power to introduce a tourist tax for overnight stays, backed by the government’s new plans. This decision is seen as a way for local leaders to fund community priorities and infrastructure, aligning with Burnham's ongoing campaigns for such measures. The Manchester Accommodation BID, which administers a £1-per-night visitor charge, is eager to collaborate with Burnham on this initiative. Council leader Bev Craig and other local leaders support the move, highlighting Manchester’s growth in tourism and its reputation as a vibrant destination.

However, the hospitality sector's response is mixed, with UKHospitality chair, Kate Nicholls, arguing that it could raise costs for visitors and hurt the economy. The proposal will undergo a 12-week public consultation, and if approved, it could take years for the tax to become a reality. The focus remains on ensuring Manchester’s growth further positively impacts its residents and businesses.
