Residents in Stretford are on edge about a proposal to build 35 new homes on the site of the old Stretford Memorial Hospital. They fear the new three-storey houses will block light and invade their privacy, overlooking gardens and towering over existing properties. Concerns about safety from increased traffic have also been raised, with claims that nearby roads are already hazardous. While objections have been filed, many agree the site needs redevelopment due to its long history of neglect and disrepair. The developer, Promenade Firswood Ltd, plans to convert the hospital itself into flats while constructing new homes, which some see as potentially beneficial. However, voices in the community are calling for a more considerate approach, suggesting that two-storey houses would be more appropriate. Amid these worries, residents stress the need for affordable housing to support local families, arguing that the current proposal may favour high-end developers over the community’s real needs. Overall, there's a shared desire for the site to be revitalised, just with a bit more thought for existing homeowners.
