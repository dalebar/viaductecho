Councillors in Bolton are worried that introducing charges for green waste bins across Greater Manchester might lead to reduced recycling rates. At a cabinet meeting, they discussed changes to a waste disposal agreement among the region's councils. Some, like Stockport and Trafford, have already imposed charges, prompting concerns that this could discourage residents from properly recycling green waste, increasing general waste instead. Bolton had previously considered a £45 fee for garden waste but ditched the plan after receiving a £3 million government grant. Graeme Wilson, Bolton’s borough treasurer, explained that charging for green waste could alter recycling behaviours and thus impact costs for all councils involved. Conservative councillor Martyn Cox highlighted the risk that charges could result in households not separating waste, leading to more rubbish sent to incinerators or landfill, which could negatively affect councils like Bolton that currently don’t charge for green waste.
