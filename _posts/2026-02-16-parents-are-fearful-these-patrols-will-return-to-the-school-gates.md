Councillors in Heywood, Greater Manchester, are voicing concerns over the Heywood Community Guard, a group patrolling outside schools claiming to ensure the safety of women and children amid worries about asylum seekers in the area. Locals, particularly women, have expressed fear regarding the group's presence, which includes night patrols in high-visibility vests. The group's founder has a troubling history, with a criminal conviction tied to a racist attack. Leaked messages from the group's internal communications revealed racist language and combative sentiments towards Muslims. Councillor Angela Brown, along with other councillors, has reached out to Greater Manchester Police to highlight community anxieties and seek clarification on how the group's activities are monitored to prevent harassment. Residents feel unsafe and have reported intimidation, stating they long for proper policing rather than vigilante actions. The council is calling for more visible police presence and a statement from the police reiterating their role as professionals, not self-appointed groups causing distress in the community.
