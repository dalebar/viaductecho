There was a significant police presence at Benchill tram stop in Wythenshawe, Manchester, on Thursday night following an incident around 9pm. Witnesses reported halted tram services due to an obstruction, allegedly involving a grey Audi involved in a police chase. A helicopter and police dogs were also seen responding to the scene. 

According to travel service Inrix, the Metrolink line between Roundthorn and Robinswood Road was disrupted but normal services resumed by 10.30pm after the blockage was cleared. Eyewitness accounts included multiple unmarked police cars and a stationary tram, with photos shared showing the police presence. Greater Manchester Police have yet to comment on the situation.
