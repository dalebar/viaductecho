Naomi Blissett, a mum-of-two, escaped a house fire in Wythenshawe and is feeling 'distraught' after being told to relocate far from her son's school. After fleeing her Wigan home following an alleged assault, she had only recently moved in with her kids. During the fire, her brother heroically saved their disabled dad but ended up in critical care due to smoke inhalation. While he’s recovering, Naomi is struggling with temporary accommodation offers from Manchester council, which are located far from Wythenshawe. She's turned down hotel stays in Rusholme because her severely autistic son finds travel stressful, and her youngest has just started school. Despite her traumatic experience, she feels the council isn’t considering her family's needs and is worried about losing her spot on the social housing waiting list. The council acknowledged the family's tough situation but explained that demand exceeds supply for local temporary accommodations, making it hard to meet specific requests.
