This weekend in Stockport looks a bit soggy, with a mix of clouds and plenty of rain. Temperatures will be in the mid-teens, but get ready for some strong winds. 

On Friday, expect temps between 8°C and 16°C with heavy rain and winds up to 19 mph. Saturday won't be much different, slightly cooler at 15°C max and with a 90% chance of rain. Winds will ease just a tad to 18 mph. By Sunday, expect more rain and gusts ramping up to 24 mph, with temps ranging from 9°C to 15°C. 

For commuters, brace for possible travel hiccups due to wet and slippery roads—allow extra time and pack your umbrella. If you're making plans, indoor activities are a safer bet, but if you must venture out, make sure you've got your waterproofs on!
