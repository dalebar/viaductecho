A man was ordered to leave Manchester city centre ahead of a Britain First rally. Supporters of the far-right group gathered near Piccadilly station for a march advocating for "remigration and mass deportations." They were held in place by a significant police presence for over an hour before the rally started. Counter demonstrations also took place, with various organisations, including Stand Up To Racism, gathering in Piccadilly Gardens. The police issued a dispersal order, which resulted in one man being escorted to a police van, though he was not arrested. By 1pm, there were three arrests for various offences, including breach of the dispersal order and assault on an emergency worker. GMP maintained a heavy presence throughout the city centre to prevent any disturbances. The council leader emphasised that Britain First was not welcome and encouraged Manchester residents to unite against hate.
