A woman, Amanda Shelley, is deeply concerned about the potential closure of Chadderton Hall Park daycare centre for adults with learning disabilities, which her brother Mark, 50, has attended for 20 years. Mark, who has serious learning difficulties and is non-verbal, thrives at the centre, and Shelley believes that shutting it down would drastically disrupt his life. Other families share her fears, with emotional impacts poised to be felt across the community due to proposed budget cuts by MioCare and Oldham Council.

MioCare states the facility needs costly repairs and suggests relocating users to other services. Councillor Barbara Brownridge reassured families that no decisions will be made until after a consultation ending on 26 February and that their input will be considered before any changes. The combined worry among families highlights the significant role the centre plays in the lives of its users.
