New research suggests that thousands more households in Greater Manchester could face flooding risks in the next 25 years unless action is taken. Aviva's Building Future Communities report details various climate threats, predicting that by 2050, 27% of households in Manchester Central and 44% in Salford could be at risk of flooding. Current figures show that around 15,989 homes in Manchester Central and 31,081 in Salford are already threatened. The report highlights that urban areas, due to hard surfaces preventing drainage, might become flash flood hotspots. It warns that across England, the number of properties at high risk could surge by 66% between 2040 and 2060. Aviva's CEO stresses the urgent need for action to address these challenges, given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods. The report elaborates on risks in every parliamentary constituency in Greater Manchester, emphasising the critical need for preparedness in the face of climate change.
