The NHS in Greater Manchester is urging parents to bring their children to extra flu vaccination clinics due to rising flu cases. With over 100 hospitalisations at the start of December, health leaders warn of a severe flu wave this winter, caused by a more virulent strain. It's particularly important for children aged two to three, as well as school-aged kids who missed vaccinations, to get protected. Dr Helen Wall from NHS Greater Manchester highlighted the importance of the annual vaccine, which is now available as a quick spray rather than an injection for most kids. Free, walk-in clinics are set up in areas like Oldham, Tameside, Manchester, Salford, Bolton, and Bury, running from December 12th to 30th. No appointment is needed, but parents can contact Intrahealth for questions or visit participating pharmacies for vaccinations. Keeping up with vaccines is crucial during this peak flu season to help everyone stay safe over the festive period.
