This week in Manchester, several criminals were sentenced, including a dishonest church treasurer and a sexual predator. Roger Ward, the treasurer of the Fourth Church of Christ, Scientist, embezzled around £40,000, claiming he'd invest it in cryptocurrency, but he lost it all. This theft has put the church’s future in jeopardy, leading to his two-year jail sentence. 

Leslie Smith, dubbed a 'remorseless monster', was sentenced to 33 years for horrific historic sex crimes against multiple victims, including children as young as five. His late wife was also implicated in his crimes. 

Another case involved Karl Cliff, 58, who engaged in sexual chats with someone he thought was a 14-year-old girl, only to discover it was an adult decoy. He received a three-year sentence and was placed on the Sex Offender Register.

Lastly, Mason Crozier, a 25-year-old, impersonated a police officer to steal cars, leading to a three year and four month jail term. Manchester's courts had a busy week dealing with these serious cases.
