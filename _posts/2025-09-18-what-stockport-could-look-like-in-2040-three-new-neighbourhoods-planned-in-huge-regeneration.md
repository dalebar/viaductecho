Stockport town centre is set for a major overhaul with plans to develop three new neighbourhoods over the next 15 years, focusing on areas like Piccadilly, Hillgate, and near the River Mersey. Supported by council leader Mark Roberts, this Â£1bn regeneration project aims to create a vibrant riverside community with parks and new homes, bringing the total to 8,000 new homes across the town. 

Hempshaw Brook will be uncovered to facilitate a 'green, connected' neighbourhood, and essential infrastructure like a new secondary school and health hub is also in the mix. Transport links will improve too, enhancing options for walking, cycling, and public transport. The council's expansion of the Stockport Mayoral Development Corporation will support these changes, which aim not just to increase housing, but to make Stockport a destination for residents and visitors alike. The project reflects a commitment to revitalising the area while preserving its historic charm. Keep your eyes peeled for these exciting developments as they unfold!
