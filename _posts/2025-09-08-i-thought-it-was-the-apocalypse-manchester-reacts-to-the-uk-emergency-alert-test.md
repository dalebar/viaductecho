Millions of people across the UK received an Emergency alert during a test on Sunday, September 7. The alert, which lasted ten seconds and included a siren, was sent to all mobile phones on 4G or 5G networks. Reactions in Manchester were mixed. Ewan McGregor (not the celeb one) found it a bit startling but recognised its potential benefits, especially in light of past tragedies. Ana Ramos thought it was quite alarming, especially since she wasn't aware of the test beforehand, while Kieran felt it was unnecessary and worried about its implications for privacy. Anca Birse saw the value in it for alerting people during emergencies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the test as crucial for public safety during national emergencies, underscoring the government's commitment to regularly test the system. The alerts have previously been used in serious situations, like warnings for Storm Ã‰owyn in Scotland and an unexploded bomb in Plymouth.
