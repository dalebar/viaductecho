Faraj Al-Shamie, the father of Jihad Al-Shamie, who carried out the recent attack outside a Manchester synagogue, has expressed his deep shock and sorrow in a statement. He strongly condemned the attack targeting innocent civilians and distanced his family from it, praying for the victims and urging media respect for their privacy. The attack, which resulted in two fatalities and several injuries, involved a car and stabbing, and is being treated as terror-related. Police have confirmed that Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, was shot dead shortly after the incident, and three other suspects have been arrested. Authorities are enhancing security measures across north Manchester.
