The 7am Avanti train from Manchester to London, a popular route arriving before 9am, will run as a 'ghost train' starting December 15, with only staff aboard. This change comes from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), which aims to create a 'firebreak' period for network flexibility during disruptions. Avanti expressed disappointment over the ruling, which affects five passenger services, including the Manchester-London route. While passengers are barred from this early service, Avanti noted they plan to introduce more trains across their network in December, including additional Liverpool services. The ORR justified their decision based on evidence from Network Rail, stating that the early service would negatively impact performance, but empty coaching stock could be managed more easily during disruptions.
