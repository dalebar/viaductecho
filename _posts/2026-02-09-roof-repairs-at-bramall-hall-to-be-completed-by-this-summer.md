Repairs to Bramall Hall’s roof are set for completion in August 2026. The Grade I listed building is currently shrouded in scaffolding as Restoration Projects work on vital repairs aimed at making the roof more waterproof and preserving the hall's treasures. During a recent tour, site manager Luke Barlow shared updates, revealing that original slates have been removed for reinstatement, exposing the roof timbers for the first time in years. The Victorian roof, initially installed over a century ago, has held up remarkably well, showcasing original markings from the 19th century. Luke described the project as a 'real challenge' but 'very exciting', with a focus on preserving as much of the original structure as possible. Funded by £1.6m from Arts Council England's Museums Estates Development Fund, this work ensures that the nearly 800-year-old hall, which has weathered Tudor times and beyond, can be enjoyed for generations to come, according to Cllr Dan Oliver from Stockport Council.
