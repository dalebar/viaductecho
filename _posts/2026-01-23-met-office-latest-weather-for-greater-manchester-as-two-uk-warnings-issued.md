Get ready for some wild weather as strong winds and heavy rain are hitting parts of the UK lately. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for today, affecting the South West and South Wales until Saturday morning, along with eastern Scotland until late tonight. Thankfully, there's no such worry for Greater Manchester or northern England just yet, but some rain and gusty winds are on the way. 

Expect a bit of light rain around Greater Manchester starting at 10am, with it kicking off later in Bolton and Wigan. Oldham and Tameside might see heavier rain this afternoon, but it should ease to showers by evening. Winds could reach 32mph. Saturday looks a bit brighter with sunny spells and gusts staying strong at 33mph. Rain is set to return Saturday night into Sunday, easing to showers by midday, with an overcast afternoon expected. Highs of 9C today and Saturday, dropping down to around 5C tonight. Keep your brolly handy!
