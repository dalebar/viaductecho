From 8 January, Stockport will start charging for parking at eighteen previously free car parks, with fees ranging from 50p for an hour to £2.40 for ten hours. The affected car parks include locations in Compstall, Marple Bridge, Bramhall, and several other areas. Additionally, six more car parks will implement charges from 10 February 2026.  

This change, agreed upon in the 2024 budget, has raised concerns among some councillors who fear that shoppers might opt for free parking at supermarkets, impacting local high street businesses. However, Cllr Grace Baynham believes that some businesses could benefit from increased parking turnover.  

Residents living near these car parks will have the option to purchase permits for £47.50 per year (£23.75 for Leisure Key holders) if on-street parking isn’t feasible. For more details, you can check local sources or sign up for updates from Stockport Nub News.
