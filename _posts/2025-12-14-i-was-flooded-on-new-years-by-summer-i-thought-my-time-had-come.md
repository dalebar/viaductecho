Chris Marks, a retired cop from Didsbury, hit a breaking point by July after his flat was flooded on New Year’s Day, leaving him homeless within months of moving in. He’s been bouncing between temporary accommodations while waiting for repairs to his flat, which are still ongoing nearly a year later. Initially given a vague potential return date of January 29, 2026, his hope of moving back remains uncertain. The stress has taken a toll on both his and his wife’s mental health. While his insurance covers accommodation and repairs, he faces soaring costs for contents insurance and property management fees, despite his flat being unlivable. 

Premier Estates, managing the property, states they’ve been working hard to facilitate repairs and provide alternative housing for affected residents. However, Chris's situation reflects a broader issue, as Didsbury was among the worst-hit areas, with ongoing concerns about the state of flood defences in Greater Manchester. The Environment Agency is attempting to address this with significant funding for repairs and maintenance, but many residents are left frustrated and anxious about future flooding risks.
