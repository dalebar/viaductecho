A member of a grooming gang, Bashir, has been on the run for nearly nine months after being convicted of raping and sexually exploiting a teenage girl, referred to as Girl B. He was part of a group of seven men who targeted two adolescents, known as Girl A and Girl B, between 2001 and 2006. Girl B was living in a children's home when she was manipulated by Bashir and two other men working at a local market. Convicted of several counts of rape and indecency with a child, Bashir is still evading capture.
