A recruitment drive in the UK is encouraging professionals like NHS workers, teachers, builders, and police to consider moving to South Australia. Roadshows will happen next month in cities like Birmingham, London, Newport, Glasgow, and Manchester, allowing attendees to chat directly with employers and learn about life down under. Many emigrants, including former UK residents like teacher Clarette Goodhead and vet Joy Clarke, share how relocating has improved their work-life balance and quality of life, noting lower pressure in schools and a nicer climate. Costs are also more manageable, as highlighted by Rebecca Barton, who noted she spends half as much on diesel in Australia compared to the UK. The initiative aims to address skills shortages while showcasing the benefits of living in a friendly community with great opportunities. The roadshow will offer insights through discussions and networking opportunities. Interested individuals can register at www.movetosouthaustralia.com.
