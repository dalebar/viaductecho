A BMW became stuck on the tram tracks at New Islington this morning, halting Metrolink services between Piccadilly and Ashton-under-Lyne. Witness and councillor Alan Good observed the car being driven onto the tracks, likely breaking down due to a drop, making recovery challenging without a tow. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) announced that tickets could be used on various bus services while the tram line was suspended. The BMW has since been removed, but delays have continued along the Ashton line. Trams are now operating again, though passengers experienced significant disruptions earlier. The incident was also reported to Greater Manchester Police, and updates were shared via TfGM's website.
