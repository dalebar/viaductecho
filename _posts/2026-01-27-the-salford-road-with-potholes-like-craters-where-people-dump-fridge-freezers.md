A Salford resident, 80, has expressed frustration over massive potholes on Duchy Road, describing them as ‘craters’ and also raising concerns about fly-tipped rubbish. He claims to have reported the issues multiple times with little action taken, highlighting a persistent dumping problem that attracts unwanted attention, including rats. Meanwhile, another local, Simon Silva, 39, echoed these sentiments about poor road conditions near Wellington Street West, noting that despite rising council tax, the repairs feel inadequate. Salford council acknowledged the problems, stating that Duchy Road is a priority area and that urgent repairs are underway, with further work scheduled within a month. They also mentioned plans for a significant resurfacing project in 2026/27, amidst a broader strategy to handle the city's fly-tipping issues. Despite the challenges, the council's recent efforts have involved addressing over 18,000 potholes, though they received an ‘amber’ rating for road maintenance—far from ideal.
