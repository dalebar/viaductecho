Plans are underway for three new neighbourhoods in Bury, aiming to provide nearly 6,000 homes, with areas designated at Elton Reservoir, Walshaw, and Simister & Bowlee. Each neighbourhood will include primary schools, healthcare facilities, community centres, playgrounds, and a new metrolink stop, all on formerly greenbelt land. The council is set to approve draft frameworks, inviting public feedback before finalising plans.

Elton Reservoir will feature 3,250 homes, with half maintained as green space and a new primary school planned. Walshaw will add 1,250 homes, including affordable housing and ample green areas. The Simister & Bowlee site will contribute 1,550 homes, mainly on the Bury side, to support the nearby Atom Valley project for advanced manufacturing jobs.

Local leaders emphasise that the developments are not just about homes; they aim to create vibrant communities with essential services and sustainable transport links, enhancing Bury's appeal for current and future residents.
