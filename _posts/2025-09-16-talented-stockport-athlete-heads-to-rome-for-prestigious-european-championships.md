Molly O'Donoghue, a skilled athlete from Stockport, is off to Rome this weekend for the European Pickleball Championships, where she'll be part of the England over-18s team. Competing from 19-21 September at the Foro Italico Sports Complex, they'll face teams from 29 countries, defending their title after winning the first championship last year in Southampton. The competition will be fierce, especially from Italy, who took bronze last year, and Spain, the silver medallists. Pickleball, a mix of badminton, tennis, and squash, is gaining traction in England, now boasting around 50,000 players. Karen Mitchell, chair of Pickleball England, noted the increased attention on the team this year, despite a few previous champions missing from the squad. Team captain Thaddea Lock expressed pride in leading the strong team, ready to battle hard and maintain their championship status. For updates and livestreams, check out the Pickleball England page.
