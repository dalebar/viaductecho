The A62 towards Oldham town centre will be closed for ten days from January 30 to February 8 for essential repairs. The closure stretches from junction 22 of the M60 at Hollinwood to the Drury Lane junction due to sewer repairs by United Utilities. Drivers will need to use alternative routes like Hollins Road or Broadway. Oldham Council is collaborating with United Utilities and National Highways to minimise disruption. Given that this is a busy route, traffic jams are expected, particularly during peak times, and this could lead to congestion in other areas. Signs are in place to guide drivers, and United Utilities have apologised for any inconvenience during the works.
