Rochdale's historic 196-year-old train station is getting a big facelift as part of a broader redevelopment. The Rochdale Development Agency plans to enhance the station entrance, which is a key access point to the town centre, with a new 25m canopy featuring a green roof, along with planters, seating, and bike racks. They'll also look at improving the station’s underpass down the line. This is all part of a significant regeneration effort, including a new station square and homes on the old retail park site. Coun Danny Meredith highlighted the importance of these upgrades, stating they’ll create a welcoming experience for the thousands who travel through. Although progress has been slow due to missed funding opportunities, the council received planning permission for the station gateway in July 2023. This scheme is crucial for the borough's rail strategy, aiming to transform brownfield sites around Rochdale’s five train stations into vibrant spaces with new homes and businesses.
