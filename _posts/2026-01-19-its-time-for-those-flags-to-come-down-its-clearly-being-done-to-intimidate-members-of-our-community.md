In Stockport, two Labour councillors, Claire Vibert and Jon Byrne, are urging for flags displayed on lampposts to be removed, stating they're fostering intimidation and division in the community. During a town hall meeting, Vibert highlighted an increase in racial incidents linked to the flags, suggesting their presence emboldens prejudice. She called for action similar to other areas that have removed such symbols, advocating for a community free from fear. Byrne echoed her sentiments, noting the rise of racism and the need for unity against divisive views. Meanwhile, council leader Mark Roberts, from the Lib Dems, defended the current flag policy, which permits flags as long as they don’t pose safety risks. He expressed disappointment in Vibert’s approach, suggesting her statements have hurt vulnerable community members. Overall, the debate remains heated, with concerns over community safety and tolerance at the forefront.
