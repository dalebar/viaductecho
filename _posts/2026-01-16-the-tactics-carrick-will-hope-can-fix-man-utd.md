Michael Carrick has developed in two coaching roles: as an interim manager for Manchester United and as the three-year boss at Middlesbrough. His first two matches in charge of United are against tough opponents, Manchester City and Arsenal. Carrick may focus on suppressing standout player Rayan Cherki's influence and could stick with some of the tactics implemented by his predecessor, Ruben Amorim, to avoid drastic changes too soon.

His successful time at Middlesbrough saw him adopt a 3-2-5 formation which led to solid possession play and plenty of goals. This tactical setup allowed flexibility for attackers, a trait that should benefit United’s versatile squad. When defending, he tends to shift to a 4-4-2 formation to limit space for rivals. Essentially, Carrick’s plan involves maintaining high possession whilst being organised defensively, akin to many modern coaching styles.
