A video has surfaced showing a driver allegedly hitting speeds over 120mph, linked to a tragic crash in Bolton on January 11 that resulted in the deaths of three teenagers and a taxi driver. The footage, believed to have been recorded by a passenger in a Seat Leon involved in the incident, exhibits reckless driving, including overtaking and driving on the wrong side of the road just hours before the crash. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are currently investigating the clip as part of the case. The victims have been identified as Mohammed Jibrael Mukhtar, Farhan Patel, and Mohammed Danyaal, while the taxi driver, Masrob Ali, was described as a gentle soul by his family. Following the crash, several passengers remain in hospital, including one woman with life-threatening injuries. GMP urges careful sharing of the footage on social media due to the impact on affected families and is appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward, detailing how to contact them.
