Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, known for his tragic attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue, grew up on Delaunays Road in Crumpsall, where he played with the son of a former neighbour, Brian Smith. Smith recalled Al-Shamie's father worked at the nearby North Manchester General Hospital. The harrowing incident occurred on October 2, during which two people, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed, and four others injured. Al-Shamie was shot by police at the scene. He held British citizenship since 2006, having entered the UK as a child. His father distanced the family from the attack, expressing profound shock. More recently, Al-Shamie had been living on Langley Crescent in Prestwich, where neighbours described him as a fitness enthusiast who frequently used to work out in his garden.
