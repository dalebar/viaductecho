Keira Horsfield, a 20-year-old mum-to-be from Manchester, was left in tears when the venue for her baby shower, The Barnhouse in Stockport, failed to open. After confirming her booking multiple times, she arrived to find the place dark and littered with rubbish. Despite waiting outside for up to 45 minutes and trying to contact the manager, no one showed up. With her pregnancy being high-risk, this celebration meant a lot to her. Luckily, she found an alternative venue, but 15 guests couldn't attend due to the last-minute change. Although The Barnhouse later offered a refund, Keira reported being blocked on Facebook and felt disheartened by the experience. The venue is now apparently permanently closed, casting doubt on future events for others looking to celebrate.
