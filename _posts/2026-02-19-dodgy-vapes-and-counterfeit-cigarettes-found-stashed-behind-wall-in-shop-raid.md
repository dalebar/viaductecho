Police in south Manchester have conducted raids at local shops, seizing a stash of counterfeit cigarettes and dodgy vapes, along with drugs and other illegal items—totaling over £212,000. A secret cache was discovered behind a bathroom wall using a drug detection dog. The operation, carried out by GMP's South District in collaboration with Trading Standards, targeted organised crime and involved visits to six premises in Chorlton and nearby areas. There are plans for five HMRC referrals for sanctions of up to £10,000, and one shop owner may face environmental violations for improper waste disposal. Constable Francesca Hooley emphasised the commitment to keeping the community safe and urged the public to report any related information anonymously through CrimeStoppers.
