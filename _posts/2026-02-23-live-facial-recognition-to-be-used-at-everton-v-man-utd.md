Police in Liverpool are set to use live facial recognition (LFR) technology during the Everton vs. Manchester United match to enhance safety. The tech will monitor the approaches to Hill Dickinson Stadium, aiming to identify individuals with serious offences or court orders, complemented by visible patrols and undercover officers. While Merseyside Police believe it will help quickly locate offenders and ensure a smooth experience for the fans, civil liberties group Big Brother Watch is calling for stricter regulations on its use. They argue that the policing should not infringe on the rights of attendees and recommend establishing a legal framework for watchlist criteria and usage contexts. Police assure that non-listed fans won’t have their data stored, with images deleted shortly after use. Everton's head of security emphasised their collaboration with the police for a safe and welcoming match day.
