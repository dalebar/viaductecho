Leaders of the far-right party Britain First were given a warning by Greater Manchester Police over a controversial poster on their 'battle bus' that insulted Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The bus was in Altrincham on September 27 and sparked complaints of anti-social behaviour. Police issued a 'section 59' warning after engaging with the occupants, allowing them to leave shortly after. Britain First claimed they were detained for three hours by multiple police vehicles, alleging that officers mistakenly identified them as a proscribed terrorist organisation, which they are not. The police later clarified that the responding officers had been addressed regarding this misunderstanding.
