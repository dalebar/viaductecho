Tributes have poured in for Prof Igor Evstigneev, a respected economics professor at the University of Manchester, who sadly passed away on November 17. The 76-year-old was found dead after reportedly falling from the Arthur Lewis Building, with police confirming there are no suspicious circumstances involved. A graduate of Moscow State University, he joined Manchester in 2001 and was noted for his significant contributions to mathematical economics and finance. Claire Alexander, head of the School of Social Sciences, highlighted his deep commitment to teaching and mentorship, particularly to his doctoral students. The Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory honoured him as a distinguished scholar whose work on stochastic processes and mathematical finance profoundly impacted the field. An inquest into his death is set to open on December 16, and the university is supporting his family during this difficult time.
