The Peopleâ€™s History Museum (PHM) in Manchester is experiencing significant building damage due to leaks from its aging roof. Despite attracting over 125,000 visitors annually and being ranked as one of TripAdvisor's top attractions, the museum needs capital funding to proceed with a much-needed roof repair on the grade-II listed Edwardian pump house, which has been a Manchester landmark since 1909. The museum has submitted a planning application to strip and re-roof the building along with other essential repairs. PHM, an independent charity, emphasises their commitment to preserving this unique structure, relying on donations and fundraising. Meanwhile, they are gearing up for festive markets from November 21-23, kicking off with a "Winter Warmer" event on November 20, featuring live music, workshops, and a chance to preview the stalls.
