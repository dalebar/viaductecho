Emma Laycock, 34, from Stockport, is frustrated with a flea infestation in her communal garden, which she claims hasn't been resolved despite reporting it to the council. Living in a flat with her support dog Buster, Emma says every time Buster goes outside, he comes back covered in fleas, and she herself has been bitten as well. Other residents with pets are facing similar issues. Emma has to spend £26 monthly on flea treatments and feels stuck indoors, missing out on the nice weather. She’s never had a visit from her housing officer in five years. While Stockport Homes, the housing provider, acknowledges the issue and states they’ve arranged treatments and consultations with pest control, Emma feels let down and believes they need to take more action. They’ve promised to monitor the situation and support residents moving forward.
