Emma Laycock, a resident of Stockport, is struggling to enjoy her communal garden due to a flea infestation that’s not been resolved despite her reports to the council. Living with her dog Buster in a flat managed by Stockport Homes, she’s frustrated as both her and her pet have been badly bitten. Other pet owners in the area are facing similar issues.

Emma spends around £26 a month on flea treatments and feels confined to her flat, missing out on the nice weather. She hasn't seen her housing officer in five years, adding to her frustration. Stockport Homes acknowledged the problem, stating they’ve consulted pest control and arranged treatments in her home, but admitted tackling fleas outdoors is a continuous challenge. They promised to keep monitoring the situation and support affected residents. Emma feels let down and believes the council needs to take responsibility.
