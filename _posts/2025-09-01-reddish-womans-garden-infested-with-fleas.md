Emma Laycock, a resident of Stockport, is struggling to enjoy the communal garden outside her flat due to a flea infestation. Despite reporting the issue to Stockport Homes, the management provider says the area is too large to handle effectively. Emma’s dog, Buster, ends up covered in fleas every time he goes outside, and she's now facing frequent bites herself. This problem has forced her to stay cooped up in her flat, missing out on the lovely weather. She’s spending £26 monthly on flea treatments for Buster, as she feels responsible for his care. Emma has lived in the property for five years and claims she hasn't seen her housing officer once during that time. In response, Stockport Homes asserts that they understand her frustration and are addressing the issue by consulting pest control experts and covering treatment costs inside the homes. They promise to keep monitoring the situation and support affected residents, including arranging a visit with Emma to discuss further concerns.
