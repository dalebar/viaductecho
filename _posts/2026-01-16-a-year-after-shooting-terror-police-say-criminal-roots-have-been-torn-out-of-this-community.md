A year after a daylight shooting in Oldham, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) report significant progress in tackling crime in Derker through Operation Vulcan. Initially aimed at addressing counterfeit goods in Cheetham Hill and Strangeways, the operation shifted focus to Derker following a string of linked shootings. The key incident involved Ethan Glasgow-Lattibeaudiere, sentenced to 16 years for firing at a taxi passenger. Launched in March, GMP's strategy included high-visibility patrols and warrants, resulting in over 200 arrests, 700 stop-searches, 200 vehicle seizures, and the recovery of 54 weapons, including four firearms. Community engagement efforts like family fun days have been crucial for building trust while working alongside Oldham Council. Detective Chief Inspector Chris Julien praised the successes and emphasised their commitment to removing criminality from Derker, ensuring community needs are met while sending a clear message to offenders.
