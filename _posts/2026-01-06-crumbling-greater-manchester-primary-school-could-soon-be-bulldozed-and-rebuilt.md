Russell Scott Primary School in Denton is set for a major makeover after a string of structural issues left the old building in a sorry state. Following a disastrous rebuild in 2015 by the now-defunct contractor Carillion, the school has struggled with leaks, flooding, and fire safety defects. Thankfully, Tameside council has signed off on plans to demolish the crumbling site and replace it with a modern, eco-friendly two-storey school designed for up to 472 pupils. The new facility will include classrooms, a nursery, an SEN unit, and improved sports facilities like a 5v5 football pitch and Multi Use Games Area (MUGA). The design features direct access to outdoor play areas and plans for rooftop solar panels. The building will be constructed next to the current one to avoid displacing students during the process. This project is part of the School Rebuilding Programme, which targets schools in need of urgent repairs, and Russell Scott is in the top 10% for condition. Exciting times ahead!
