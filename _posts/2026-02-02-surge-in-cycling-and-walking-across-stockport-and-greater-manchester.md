Greater Manchester and Stockport are seeing more folks opting for walking, wheeling, and cycling, with over 700 million active travel trips in 2025—up from 510 million in 2021. That’s about one-third of all journeys now! Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) credits this boost partly to a free e-bike rental scheme launched in Edgeley in July 2025 and the introduction of new cycling and walking routes under the Bee Network. Plans for further investment in infrastructure like footpaths and junctions are on the horizon too. Dame Sarah Storey, Greater Manchester's active travel commissioner, expressed excitement over the progress but acknowledged more work is needed, particularly around safety perceptions. Richard Nickson, TfGM's Active Travel Network Director, pointed out that quality infrastructure is key to supporting this shift towards active travel. The goal is clear: making it easier and more appealing for people to incorporate active travel into their everyday routines.
