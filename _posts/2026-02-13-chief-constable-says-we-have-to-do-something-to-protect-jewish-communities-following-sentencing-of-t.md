Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson has emphasised the need to protect Jewish communities from extremists but downplayed the idea of routine armed patrols outside synagogues. His comments come following the life sentences of two terrorists, Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein, who plotted an Islamic State attack on Jewish communities in Manchester. He acknowledged the fear among Jews, noting that their children are unique in facing strict security measures at schools. While affirming the police's commitment to safeguarding these communities, he recognised the ongoing global threat from organisations like ISIS. Sir Stephen stated that the police already have armed officers protecting Jewish areas, responding swiftly to incidents like the recent Yom Kippur attack. He underscored the importance of a collective societal response to extremism, warning that if Jewish communities are threatened, it endangers everyone. He praised the investigative efforts that thwarted the recent plot, highlighting the courage of those involved. Overall, he expressed a strong commitment to improving safety measures for Jewish communities amid escalating fears and rising hatred.
