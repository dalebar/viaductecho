Merseyway shopping centre saw a whopping 10 million visitors in 2025, with the newly opened Stockroom library and community hub boosting footfall. Stockroom has become a lively spot since opening in May 2025, offering book loans, computer access, events, and even a café and play area for kids. Stockport Council noted the hub has made the town centre feel more welcoming and vibrant. Cllr Dan Oliver highlighted a surge in library usage and community engagement through various free events, including storytelling, workshops, and celebrations. Kate Doyle, Stockroom's Creative Programme Manager, emphasised the community's role in shaping activities, making it a space for creativity and connection. With more events and exhibitions planned, including an outdoor projection in February, Stockroom is set to keep buzzing with energy and creativity.
