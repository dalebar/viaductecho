A 1930s lido, originally opened in 1935, is facing demolition to make way for new homes. After serving various purposes, including a Mecca Bingo hall until 2023, the building has been vacant and is said to be in disrepair. Developers McCarthy Stone and Built Development Ltd have submitted plans to retain only the façade of the lido while constructing two new blocks of flats. One block will offer 40 retirement living apartments, featuring 26 one-beds and 14 two-beds, while the second block will provide 39 affordable housing units, with 27 one-beds and 12 two-beds. Additionally, four retail spaces are planned for the ground floor. The project aims to address the need for specialist and affordable housing in the area.
