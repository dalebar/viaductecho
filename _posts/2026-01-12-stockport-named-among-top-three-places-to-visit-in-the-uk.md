Stockport has been ranked the third best place to visit in the UK by Time Out magazine for 2026, highlighting its vibrant energy, creativity, and independent culture. Time Out notes the lively Market Place and Underbank filled with bars, record shops, and indie cafés, offering a less boozy vibe than Edinburgh's Cowgate. The town boasts Michelin-class dining at Where The Light Gets In and a trendy bar from Cumbrian brewery Fell. Plus, the Peak District is just a short train ride away for a peaceful escape. A Stockport Council spokesperson expressed pride in the recognition, praising the town's quality and independent spirit. Stirling topped the list, followed by Hastings, with Derby and Blackpool also making the cut. Overall, it's a great time to explore Stockport's thriving scene!
