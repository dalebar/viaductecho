The Mayor of Greater Manchester has launched a £500k Green Spaces Fund, supporting nearly 20 community-led projects aimed at creating vibrant, mood-boosting green spaces across the region. In this sixth funding round, 19 new projects received backing, with three based in Stockport. Notable initiatives include the transformation of a neglected area into Cascade Garden, a playful food park from a problematic car park in Edgeley, and colourful improvements in Brinnington featuring murals and benches. Mayor Andy Burnham highlighted the importance of these projects in addressing climate issues and fostering healthier communities. The fund, backed by Together Money and Autotrader, has already invested £3.5m since its inception in 2022, promoting mental well-being and community cohesion through green spaces. Other funded projects include a street park in Wigan and a transformative garden at a Rochdale hospital, all aimed at reconnecting local communities with nature.
