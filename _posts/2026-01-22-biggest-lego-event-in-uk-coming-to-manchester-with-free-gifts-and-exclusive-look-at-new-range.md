Bricktastic, the UK’s biggest Lego event, is landing in Manchester next month at Manchester Central for a weekend full of fun and creativity. Set for February 21 and 22, the event will offer an exclusive sneak peek at the new Lego Smart Play System before its March release. This high-tech system showcases interactive Smart Bricks, Smart Tags, and Smart Minifigures. With over 300 model builders displaying their skills, fans of various themes like Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Friends will find something to enjoy.

All proceeds go to Fairy Bricks, a charity donating Lego to children in hospitals, with past events contributing significantly to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. Tickets are £20 and sell quickly, especially since under-fours get in free. Visitors can enjoy a range of activites, free goodies, and shopping for Lego sets, from mini figures to retired collections. The event runs from 9am to 5pm both days, with the option for a quieter session for those with additional needs. Grab your tickets soon as they are limited!
