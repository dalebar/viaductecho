Waalid Saadoui, a 38-year-old from Wigan, is on trial for plotting a massive attack against the Jewish community in Manchester, inspired by the 2015 Paris attacks. Prosecutors allege he "hero-worshipped" Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind behind those attacks, and was in contact with an undercover officer discussing his plans. Saadoui amassed a stockpile of weapons, including two assault rifles and a semi-automatic pistol, while also withdrawing £90,000 in cash to fund his terror plot.

The court heard how he posted extremist content on social media, expressing a desire to kill Jews and describing violent acts with “overwhelming anger.” His discussions with the undercover operative included strategies for sourcing weapons and carrying out attacks, clearly indicating a serious intent to commit mass murder. Saadoui and his co-defendant, Amar Hussein, deny the charges against them, while the case continues at Preston Crown Court.
