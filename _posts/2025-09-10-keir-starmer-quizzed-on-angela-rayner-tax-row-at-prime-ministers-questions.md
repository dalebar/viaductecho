Keir Starmer's leadership is under fire after Angela Rayner resigned as Deputy Prime Minister for tax issues with her new home. She admitted to not paying enough stamp duty, citing incorrect advice, and later referred herself to the ethics watchdog. While an investigation found she acted with integrity, she still breached the ministerial code, prompting her resignation and a cabinet reshuffle. During Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative MP Luke Evans grilled Starmer about government integrity, highlighting various scandals, including Rayner's situation. The Prime Minister defended the actions taken regarding the ministerial code, pointing out that Rayner had proactively involved the independent adviser. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch also chimed in, questioning the Prime Minister's judgement in appointing Peter Mandleson and criticising ongoing issues within the government. Overall, the situation reflects rising concerns about leadership and decision-making in the Labour Party.
