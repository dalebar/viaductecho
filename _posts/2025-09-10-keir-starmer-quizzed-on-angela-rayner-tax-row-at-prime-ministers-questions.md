Keir Starmer’s leadership is under fire after Angela Rayner resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and housing secretary, admitting she owed less stamp duty due to bad advice. She referred herself to an ethics watchdog and was found to have breached the ministerial code but acted with integrity. Her departure led to a cabinet reshuffle affecting several Greater Manchester MPs. During Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative MP Luke Evans slammed the government’s integrity, calling out various scandals, including fraud allegations against ministers. In response, the Prime Minister cited past improvements to the ministerial code and contrasted Rayner's self-referral to previous government mishaps. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch also commented, questioning the PM’s judgement regarding controversial appointments and linking them to the government's ongoing issues. Overall, there's a strong sentiment of chaos and bad decision-making within the government following Rayner's resignation.
