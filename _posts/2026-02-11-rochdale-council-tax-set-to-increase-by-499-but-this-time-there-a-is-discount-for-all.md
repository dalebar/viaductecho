Rochdale is gearing up for a 4.99% rise in council tax, but don’t worry too much – the council plans to offer a 2% discount, which works out to about £41 off residents' bills. This increase is mainly to ensure they balance the budget and secure government funding for next year. Council leader Neil Emmott highlighted that, by raising tax, they can maintain essential services and provide this discount thanks to their built-up reserves. Adult and children’s services, which form a massive part of the £355.6m budget, are currently over budget due to rising demand and costs. A government recovery grant is helping ease some of this financial strain. The final vote on this tax hike will happen on February 25, and if approved, the new rates will kick in by spring.
