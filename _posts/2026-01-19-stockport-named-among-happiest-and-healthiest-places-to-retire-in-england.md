Stockport has been highlighted as one of the top places to retire in England, ranked 44th overall by The Sunday Times. The ranking is based on factors like life expectancy and medical care access, with Stockport boasting the tenth highest life expectancy in England at 81 years. The borough has good GP access, with 14 surgeries per 100,000 residents. Other factors contributing to the ranking included A&E waiting times, Happiness Index scores, care home availability, and referral times for trauma services. The study emphasised that well-connected towns and cities with ample activities promote better physical and mental health for older folks. However, Dr Devan Moodley from Health Connect Global noted that more investment in community care and access to family doctors is needed.
