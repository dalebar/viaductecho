Plans are in the works for a huge rail freight interchange and warehousing east of the M6, affecting Wigan, St Helens, and Warrington. The project, proposed by ILPN RFI from Jersey, may involve demolishing homes and commercial buildings south of the Chat Moss line and west of Winwick Lane. It would feature 8.2 million square feet of warehousing, a rail terminal for up to 16 trains daily, and various logistics facilities.

To improve connectivity, new bridges will need to be built, and the site will include lorry parking, welfare facilities, and energy centres with battery storage. The development will also necessitate new internal roads, pedestrian paths, and changes to public rights of way.

A statutory consultation is running from October 28 to December 23, allowing locals to get involved and view plans. More details about traffic diversions and planning applications can be found on the Public Notices Portal.
