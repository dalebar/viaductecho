Briscoe Lane in Newton Heath is now adorned with Union Jack and St George's flags, thanks to a grassroots campaign called 'Operation Raise The Colours'. This initiative has stirred mixed feelings among locals. While some, like shop owner Lucienne Akouatcha, find it normal to display the national flag, others have raised concerns over the motivations behind the campaign, particularly its ties to right-wing groups. Most residents seem supportive, with many stating they don't mind the flags and appreciate the expression of national pride. Manchester council has confirmed the flags will remain, as long as they pose no safety issues. Community reactions range from indifferent acceptance to active support, reflecting a diverse array of opinions on national symbols in public spaces.
