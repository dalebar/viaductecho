Briscoe Lane is decked out with Union Jack and St George's flags, thanks to a grassroots campaign called 'Operation Raise The Colours'. This initiative popped up about a week ago and has sparked both support and controversy. Some locals, like Lucienne and Ann, seem relatively indifferent or even supportive, seeing the flags as a normal display of national pride. Others, including Pablo O'Hana, actively oppose the flags, claiming they donâ€™t represent the true spirit of the country. Manchester council has indicated they won't remove the flags as long as they don't pose safety risks. Paul Beresford and Omar, a local shop worker, welcome the flags but want more unity and understanding among residents. Overall, the flags are set to stay in place as they don't breach council policies.
