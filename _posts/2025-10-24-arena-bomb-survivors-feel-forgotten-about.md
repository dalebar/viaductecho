In the wake of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which claimed 22 lives and injured 116, the Greater Manchester Resilience Hub was established to support young people affected. Kallie, a school cleaner, shares her struggles with mental health, feeling that her teenage therapy was incomplete and unhelpful. Abbey, 21, highlights the positive impact of the "One Love Group," where sheâ€™s built lasting friendships through shared grief. She's studying criminal and forensic psychology and expresses confusion over the senseless tragedy. Kaci, reflecting on her feelings since she was 13, believes the emotional impact remains unchanged. Abbey calls for more specialised mental health services to better address these issues.
