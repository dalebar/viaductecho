Hundreds of Galatasaray fans paraded through Manchester last night, lighting fireworks and flares as they made their way to the Etihad for their Champions League match against Manchester City. The vibrant procession, marked by chants like “We are the best, Galatasaray!” filled the city centre and drew in curious onlookers. Beginning at Shambles Square, fans were escorted by a substantial police presence as they moved through various streets, with the scene particularly lively on Addington Street, where red smoke billowed from the flares. Photographers captured the electrifying atmosphere, as the night sky was lit up with rockets amidst enthusiastic celebrations.
