Thomson Street Bridge in Stockport has been renamed Driver John Axon Bridge to honour local hero John Axon, who tragically died while trying to save lives in a train accident in 1957. The renaming took place on 30 September, with rail minister Lord Hendy and Axon’s grandchild, Melanie, present. Axon, born in 1900 in Stockport, attempted to regain control of a runaway freight train but lost his life in the collision. He was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his bravery, which saved many lives. Cllr Grace Baynham expressed that the renaming serves as a reminder of Axon’s courage, while Keith Nash-Whitmore highlighted the community's pride in recognising a true hero. Melanie Axon shared the family's gratitude for the tribute as it keeps her grandfather’s legacy alive. Lord Hendy added that Axon embodies the spirit of railway service, ensuring his memory will endure in the history of Britain’s railways. The bridge now stands as a daily reminder of his valour for the community.
