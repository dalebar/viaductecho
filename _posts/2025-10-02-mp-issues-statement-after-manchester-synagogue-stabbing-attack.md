A shocking attack outside a synagogue in north Manchester has left the local MP, Graham Stringer, heartbroken, calling it an attempt to hurt the city's tolerance. Armed police and paramedics rushed to the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall after reports of a car driving into people, resulting in one stabbing. The police confirmed that a male suspect was shot shortly after. Four members of the public sustained injuries. Stringer urged Mancunians to unite in the aftermath, stressing the importance of community solidarity, echoing sentiments from previous incidents like the Manchester Arena attack. Mayor Andy Burnham reassured that while the situation is under control, the risk isnâ€™t completely gone and highlighted the close ties between police and community security trusts to ensure safety. He expressed his thoughts for the victims and their families during their recovery.
