Free breakfast clubs are set to expand in primary schools across England from April, saving parents up to £450 a year. This rollout will extend to 500 more schools, helping around 300,000 kids. In Greater Manchester, 34 new clubs will open, with 16 in Manchester, five in Oldham, and the rest around the area. This is part of Labour's pledge to provide healthy breakfasts that aid children's skills in reading, writing, and maths, while also giving parents some free childcare support. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson highlighted how these clubs are a game-changer for working families, helping kids start their day right and making life a bit easier for parents. To find out if your local school is involved, there’s an interactive map available.
