On December 15, around 65 homes in Stretford, Trafford, lost power due to an unexpected issue with underground cables. Residents reported being left in the dark, with alarms going off and no heating. One local shared how she and her partner had to resort to takeaways for dinner and were huddled around candles to stay warm, as it was freezing in their home. Concerns grew for families with young children nearby, who were also feeling frightened. Electricity North West estimated that power might be restored by 6.30am the next day, but they cautioned that this could change. The outage affected several postcodes and involved potential repairs that could prolong the wait for electricity. The utility company assured residents they would work as quickly and safely as possible to resolve the situation.
