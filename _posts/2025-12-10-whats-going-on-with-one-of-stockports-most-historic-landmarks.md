The future of Woodbank Hall, a historic grade-II listed building in Stockport, is uncertain as it remains on Historic England's heritage at-risk register due to its poor condition. Built in 1814, it’s considered a vital part of the town’s identity. Stockport Council, which faced criticism over delays in repairs, has invested over £250,000 on security and essential fixes. Councillor Micheala Meikle mentioned that detailed proposals for the Hall's long-term use are being developed and will secure further funding to transform it into a community asset. Historic England looks forward to supporting these plans, highlighting the Hall’s significant historical value, having been designed by Thomas Harrison and built for industrialist Peter Marsland. Regular updates from the council will be shared with residents as proposals are finalised.
