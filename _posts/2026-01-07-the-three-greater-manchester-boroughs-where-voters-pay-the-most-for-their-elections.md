Three boroughs in Greater Manchester—Manchester, Salford, and Stockport—ranked among the top ten most expensive areas for elections, each costing over £1 million according to the Taxpayer’s Alliance. Leeds Council topped the list with costs exceeding £3.1 million, followed by Coventry and Sheffield. Manchester spent £1.6 million for its elections, excluding upcoming 2024 costs, while Salford and Stockport spent £1.4 million and £1.3 million, respectively. The councils argue these figures don't fairly reflect costs per head, noting larger areas like Manchester have inherent disadvantages. They defend their frequent elections as a means of ensuring democratic accountability, with Salford highlighting it followed government guidelines for councils. Salford also had numerous elections scheduled between 2021 and 2024, contributing to costs. Stockport referenced added expenses from recent boundary changes. While the Taxpayer’s Alliance suggests moving to all-out elections could save money, the councils underscored the importance of regular local representation and the complexities involved in changing election cycles.
