Salford Council is under pressure to sell the CorpAcq Stadium due to claims it's costing £1.6 million a year, with the Conservative opposition advocating for the funds to be redirected towards fixing local roads. The stadium, owned by town hall-controlled CosCos, primarily hosts the Sale Sharks rugby union team and Salford's phoenix rugby league team. With mounting financial pressures, the Tories have proposed an amendment for the council budget meeting on February 25, arguing that the stadium's costs are unsustainable, especially with a planned 4.99% council tax increase for residents. They believe the funds could be better spent on city improvements rather than maintaining a stadium that loses money.

On the other hand, the Labour party supports ownership, claiming it’s essential for the city’s rugby strategy and community development. They aim to attract more events and engage grassroots participation in sports. As discussions continue, concerns grow over the financial viability of the stadium and its impact on local residents.
