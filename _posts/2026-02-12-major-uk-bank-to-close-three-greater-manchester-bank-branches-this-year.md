Lloyds Banking Group has announced plans to close 95 branches across the UK, impacting three locations in Greater Manchester: Halifax branches in Ashton-under-Lyne and Didsbury, along with a Lloyds branch in Altrincham, all set to shut in June. This move follows a previous announcement in September for the closure of 49 branches by October, leaving Lloyds with 610 remaining branches. While the exact number of staff affected hasn’t been disclosed, all employees will be offered roles at other branches or within the company. Despite these closures, 14 new banking hubs will be introduced across the country to maintain cash access, providing shared spaces for various banking services. Lloyds emphasised their commitment to evolving customer needs, offering more flexible banking options, including apps and community bankers.
