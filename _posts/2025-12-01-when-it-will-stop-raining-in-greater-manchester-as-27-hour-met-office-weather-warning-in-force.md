Greater Manchester is bracing for heavy rain today, with a yellow Met Office warning in effect from midnight until 3am Tuesday. Expect non-stop showers throughout the day, causing potential disruptions, including flooding in some homes and businesses. Road, rail, and bus services may face delays too. The Met Office predicts 20-40 mm of rain across most areas, with higher elevations possibly seeing 50-80 mm or even 100-120 mm in certain spots. Strong winds will accompany the downpours, especially near coasts and on high ground.

The warning extends to other parts of the North West, the East Midlands, Scottish Borders, West Midlands, and Yorkshire. Meanwhile, an amber warning for South Wales is in place until midnight, signalling a risk to life due to potential deep floodwater and forecasted rainfall of up to 120 mm. Similar yellow warnings apply in parts of the southwest and northwest of England, central and northern Wales, and southwest Scotland. Stay safe out there!
