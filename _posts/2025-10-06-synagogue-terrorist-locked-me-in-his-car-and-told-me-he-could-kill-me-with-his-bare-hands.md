A young woman has shared her chilling experience with Jihad Al-Shamie, the attacker who targeted a synagogue in Manchester, leading to tragic fatalities. She described a terrifying episode where he stalked her outside her home, trapped her in his car, and threatened her life. Their relationship, which lasted four months, included manipulation and grooming, with Al-Shamie pushing extremist views onto her. She discovered his true age and background, which he tried to hide, and felt ashamed to reveal their relationship to her family. Despite her fear and realisation of his troubling nature, she hesitated to contact the police, not believing he would take violent action. The woman recounted moments when Al-Shamie threatened her, pulling her hair and saying he could kill her without anyone knowing. After the attack, she felt a mix of shock and shame, reflecting on the dark side of someone she thought she knew. Sheâ€™s now left with questions about how things escalated, expressing regret for not having reported him sooner.
