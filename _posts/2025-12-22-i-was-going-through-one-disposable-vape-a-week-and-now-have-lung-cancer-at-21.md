Kayley Boda, a 22-year-old from Manchester, started vaping at 15 and was diagnosed with lung cancer at 21. She vaped disposable vapes, and after experiencing alarming symptoms like coughing up brown mucus and blood, she faced dismissal from doctors multiple times before an X-ray and seven biopsies led to her diagnosis. Initially told it was likely not cancer due to her age, further tests revealed stage three lung cancer. After surgery to remove part of her lung and nearby lymph nodes, she struggled with recovery and severe chemotherapy reactions that sent her back to hospital. Now, with ongoing treatment and challenges in daily life, Kayley regrets her vaping choices and warns others of the risks, stating, “Stay off the vapes, because they will catch up with you.” She emphasises how her cancer journey has changed her perspective and urges everyone to reconsider vaping.
