Helen McHale, CEO of Stockport Homes, is retiring after 20 years, having overseen its growth from 225 to over 675 staff since its establishment in 2005. Under her leadership, Stockport Homes developed into a top-performing housing provider, managing over 12,000 properties. Despite recent challenges such as increasing demand for affordable housing and criticisms regarding repair speeds, the organisation was recently rated 'high performing' with good feedback on value for money.

In her retirement announcement, McHale reflected on her journey since joining Stockport in 2001, highlighting collaborative efforts to transform housing services positively. The council leader praised her transformative role and long-term commitment to improving community services. As McHale steps down, she leaves behind a solid legacy and an opportunity for new leadership amid ongoing pressures in the social housing sector. The search for her successor will be crucial, considering the high demand and issues still facing Stockport Homes.
