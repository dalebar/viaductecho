Ashton Town Hall is on the verge of a much-anticipated restoration, with Tameside council leader Eleanor Wills promising its transformation by 2030. Following essential repairs, design and feasibility studies are now in progress for the Grade-II listed building, which has been empty since 2015. Plans include revitalised community spaces, a wine bar, coffee shop, restaurant, and office areas, all part of a £3.4 million regeneration strategy for Ashton town centre. With groundwork for Market Square already happening, the aim is to blend heritage with modern use, creating a vibrant hub for civic and commercial activities. A budget of £91,000 has been allocated for the next design phase, with construction slated to begin in 2028 and wrap up by 2030, pending funding. Deputy leader Andrew McLaren emphasised the project’s significance in preserving the town’s heritage while fostering community and business opportunities. Plans will likely be confirmed at the next council meeting.
