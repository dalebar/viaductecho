Sough Tunnel, a mile-long structure linking Lancashire and Manchester for over 175 years, boasts two turrets that once served steam trains and now help regulate air pressure for diesel trains. This prevents damage to the tunnel and keeps things pleasant for passengers. In the 80s and 90s, local teens made a habit of daring each other to walk through, prompting warnings from rail bosses and police. The tunnel was Grade II listed in 1984, and in 2020, it underwent repairs using a unique helicopter technique when access from surrounding land proved too tricky. The team flew in materials to construct a new metal grille over the shafts, saving costs and minimising disruption from heavy vehicle access. Mark E Smith from Network Rail noted this innovative approach made safety repairs both effective and environmentally considerate.
