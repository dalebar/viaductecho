Traders at Stockport Indoor Market are worried that a proposed hike in car parking charges could hit their business hard. The local council plans to raise the hourly parking rate by nearly 40%, from £1.10 to £1.50, and increase rates for longer stays. While the council believes these charges are in line with nearby towns, market traders feel it could deter shoppers, causing them to rush and spend less time (and money) at local shops. Business owners like Harrison Marsland and Mark Gough argue that easier parking access is crucial for drawing customers, especially when supermarkets offer free parking. The council, led by Grace Baynham, aims to monitor the impact on footfall but faces criticism from the Federation of Small Businesses for making town centre access more difficult. The new parking charges will be part of the council's annual budget vote on February 26.
