Lucy Powell has clinched enough nominations from constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to secure a spot on the ballot for deputy leader, according to her campaign. They believe they have over the required 33 nominations, setting her up for a contest against Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. Powell's campaign highlights her focus on unity and addressing issues like child poverty, while Phillipson feels "honoured" to be the first candidate confirmed for the ballot after securing nominations from trade unions and multiple CLPs. Both candidates are actively rallying member support, with Phillipson boasting endorsements and a strong nomination tally. They’re vying for the chance to connect with Labour’s base and represent their values in leadership.
