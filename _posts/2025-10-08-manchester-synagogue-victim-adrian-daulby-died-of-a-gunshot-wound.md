Adrian Daulby, a victim of the Manchester synagogue attack, died from a single fatal gunshot wound from a police-issued firearm, as confirmed by the IOPC. Another man, Yoni Finlay, was also injured by police gunfire during the incident. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, was killed by armed officers trying to protect the congregation at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue. The IOPC found no misconduct by the officers involved and is investigating the shooting's circumstances, including whether police actions contributed to Daulby’s death. They’re examining footage from the incident and reviewing initial police statements. Meanwhile, Counter Terrorism Policing North West is conducting a separate investigation into Al-Shamie's attack. The IOPC has reached out to families affected by the tragedy, expressing their condolences and support. They’re also assessing a referral from GMP concerning previous allegations against Al-Shamie. Officers involved in the incident are being treated as witnesses, which is standard in UK police shootings.
