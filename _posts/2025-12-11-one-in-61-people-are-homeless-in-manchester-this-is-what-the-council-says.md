Homelessness in Manchester is a growing concern, with one in 61 people affected—totaling nearly 9,600 individuals, including 4,678 children. This makes Manchester the area with the highest homelessness rate in the north west. Nationwide, over 382,000 people, including 175,000 children, are expected to be homeless this Christmas. The crisis has worsened, with an 8% rise in homelessness since last year. The government has announced a new £3.5 billion strategy to tackle the issue, aiming to halve long-term rough sleeping and eliminate the use of B&Bs for families by 2029/30. Although the situation is dire, Manchester City Council asserts stability in temporary accommodation numbers and has largely phased out B&B use for families. They are collaborating with charities like Shelter to find solutions. However, the call for more social housing is essential, with Shelter highlighting that many families face prolonged stays in temporary accommodation due to rising rents and the shortage of social homes. With winter approaching, the urgency to support the homeless community is paramount, urging contributions to charitable efforts for lasting change.
