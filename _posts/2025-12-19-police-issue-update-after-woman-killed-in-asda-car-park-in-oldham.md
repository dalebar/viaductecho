A driver has been arrested after a tragic incident where a 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Peugeot Expert van in the Asda car park on Greenfield Lane, Shaw, Oldham. The collision occurred as she was heading back to her car on the evening of December 18. Emergency services arrived at around 6:50 PM, but sadly, the pensioner succumbed to her injuries. A 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving, having initially been detained on suspicion of causing serious injury. The Greater Manchester Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit is pursuing a thorough investigation and is appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward. Information can be shared directly with the SCIU or through GMP’s Live Chat, quoting log 2900 of December 18, 2025, and tips can be given anonymously through Crimestoppers.
