New research has highlighted a worrying trend of red-light jumping among road users in Manchester, particularly in busy junctions. A study of 7,000 road users revealed that one in three delivery moped riders and a quarter of delivery cyclists ignore red lights, with 43% of pedestrians also taking risks. Food delivery cyclists were notably non-compliant, with 21% riding through red lights, while 16% of rental e-bike users did the same. The research, conducted by Nextbase, aimed to gather statistical evidence following customer feedback about road user behaviour. Disturbingly, 31% of delivery moped riders were seen breaking the rules. Motorists also contributed to the chaos, with 6% distracted during red lights, often using their phones. The intersections with the highest rates of red-light violations included Deansgate & John Dalton Street and Portland St & Piccadilly Gardens. Bryn Brooker from Nextbase stressed the importance of respecting road rules, especially with school back in session. He encouraged drivers to consider dash cams for clarity in accidents. The study serves as a reminder that these rules exist for everyoneâ€™s safety.
