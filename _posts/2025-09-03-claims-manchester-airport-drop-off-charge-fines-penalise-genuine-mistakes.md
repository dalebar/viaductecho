Bury North MP James Frith has raised concerns over Manchester Airport's drop-off and pick-up fines, arguing they punish honest mistakes rather than deliberate misuse. In a letter, he described the system as "confusing," with inadequate signs and unclear instructions leading to fines for short stays, often under five minutes. Current charges include £5 for five minutes and up to £25 for half an hour. Frith called for a review of the policy, suggesting longer payment windows and notifications for missed payments, highlighting that the fines seem disproportionate. Oldham MP Jim McMahon shared similar worries, requesting transparency on income from these charges. However, a spokesperson for the airport defended the barrier-less system, stressing it reduces congestion and generally receives positive passenger feedback, with signage aimed at preventing missed payments.
