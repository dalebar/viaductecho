Stockport's been experiencing an uptick in racial incidents, reportedly linked to the display of England flags and recent hotel protests regarding asylum seekers. Stockport Homes, which oversees many social housing properties, revealed a spike in hate crimes, with 2.4 incidents per 1,000 homes in 2024/25, well above the national average of 0.7. During a town hall meeting, Green Party Councillor Liz Crix questioned whether these incidents were on the rise since the flags and protests began. Carmel Chambers from Stockport Homes confirmed a notable increase in incidents with racial overtones, suggesting a correlation with ongoing tensions. The incidents appear to be widespread across the borough, often starting from typical neighbour disputes that escalate. Some flags have been replaced for seasonal displays, but there is ongoing pressure from councillors to remove them entirely, with claims they contribute to a culture of intimidation. Councillors Jon Byrne and Claire Vibert have strongly advocated for their removal to demonstrate a zero-tolerance stance on racism, even if it's masked as patriotism.
