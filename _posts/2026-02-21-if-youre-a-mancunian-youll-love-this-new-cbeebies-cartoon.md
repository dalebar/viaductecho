The new CBeebies cartoon, "Rafi the Wishing Wizard," is set in Manchester and features a seven-year-old girl who can make one wish a day, leading to plenty of fun and surprises. The show highlights local landmarks like Beetham Tower and the Aquatics Centre, which helps make the setting feel familiar for UK audiences. Executive producer Tom Cousins shared that Manchester holds a special place in his heart, while actor Kieron Richardson, who voices one of Rafi’s dads, relates to the storyline as a Mancunian parent. Burnley-born actor Muzz Khan is excited about representing the North in this series. Unlike typical magic shows, Rafi’s family embraces their magical abilities openly, adding a unique twist. With 26 episodes planned, the show aims to showcase Manchester to international audiences while giving locals a hearty nod. Richardson believes Mancunians will especially love it, as the city's iconic features are spotlighted.
