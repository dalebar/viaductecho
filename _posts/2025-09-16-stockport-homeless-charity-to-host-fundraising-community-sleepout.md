The Wellspring, a charity in Stockport, is organising a 'sleepout' on Saturday, 4th October 2025, to raise funds and awareness about homelessness. This event invites locals to sleep outdoors, giving them a taste of the struggles faced by people without homes. The charity, located on Harvey Street, provides vital support like food, clothing, mental health care, and employment guidance to vulnerable individuals. They've reported a troubling 13% rise in homelessness presentations in Stockport recently, illustrating the growing urgency of the issue. The sleepout aims not just to raise money but also to foster understanding of homelessness among participants. For more details and registration, check out The Wellspringâ€™s website.
