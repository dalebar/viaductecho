Manchester Cathedral was buzzing today as the city bid farewell to Gary 'Mani' Mounfield, the beloved bassist of the Stone Roses, who passed away peacefully in his sleep at 63. The streets were filled with fans in camo-print and Adidas gear, reflecting the Madchester era. His funeral began in Heaton Moor, where many gathered to applaud the hearse, draped in the iconic 'Bye Bye Badman' print. The procession featured two football scarves, floral tributes, and a fleet of Vespas and Lambrettas honouring Mani's scooter passion.

Fans gathered at the cathedral to celebrate his life, including notable musicians like Bobby Gillespie and Ian Brown, who reminisced about Mani's love for Manchester. A moving 45-minute service featured hymns and tributes, and as the hearse departed, the crowd erupted into cheers and song, symbolising the lasting impact Mani had on the city's music scene. It was a truly heartfelt send-off for a man who shaped Manchester’s musical legacy, with many attendees sharing their personal connections to his work.
