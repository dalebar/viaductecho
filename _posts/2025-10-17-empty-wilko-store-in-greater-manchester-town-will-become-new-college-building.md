The old Wilkos store in Ashton town centre is set to be revamped into a new Tameside College building. Located next to Tameside One, it will provide eleven new classrooms and exam spaces to accommodate the growing number of students, which jumped from 2,000 in 2019 to an expected 4,400 by 2026. The store closed down in September 2023, and the council aims to have the new facilities ready for learners by September 2026. Tameside officials see this development as a way to boost local education and revitalise the town centre. Coun Leanne Feeley expressed excitement about the decision, highlighting its potential impact on young peopleâ€™s education. Jackie Moores, principal of Tameside College, shared enthusiasm for the additional space, which will help meet local demand. The plans received council approval on October 15 and are pending funding and board approval before moving forward.
