A building in Manchester city centre partially collapsed, causing a noticeable shake, as described by witnesses. They mentioned the scene didn’t seem intentional, with scaffolding still in place and people in the nearby building peering out to see what was going on. The structure is located near the River Irwell, right across from the Lowry Hotel. You can catch updates and share your own story ideas through BBC Radio Manchester’s platforms.
