Lisa Nandy reassured that the security services won’t be exempt from the Hillsborough Law, which aims to enforce honesty from public officials, amidst concerns from families affected by the Manchester Arena bombing. The bill, aimed at holding officials accountable, faces criticism for potential loopholes allowing intelligence chiefs to evade responsibility. Nandy acknowledged the challenges in ensuring the law applies to security services while allowing them to perform their duties. She dismissed any plans to withdraw the legislation and emphasised ongoing dialogue with families and campaigners. Critics, like MP Ian Byrne, expressed disappointment over the government's amendments, suggesting they weaken the law and hinder justice for the families impacted by tragedies like the Manchester Arena attack. Both Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Merseyside mayor Steve Rotheram voiced their concerns regarding these amendments, stressing the need for transparency and accountability in public services. They urged the government to withdraw the proposed changes to preserve the integrity of the Hillsborough Law and honour commitments made to families seeking justice.
