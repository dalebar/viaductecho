Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester has put visiting restrictions in place due to a rise in winter bugs like norovirus. Open visiting hours have been suspended, and relatives are asked to avoid three specific wards—AAU2, AMU1, and OPAU—affected by infections. For all other adult wards, visiting is limited to one person per patient from 1pm to 7pm. Children's and maternity units remain unaffected. Hospital officials are taking additional measures like increased cleaning and testing to contain the spread. They acknowledge the importance of visiting for patients and families, especially those with conditions like dementia or learning disabilities, who can still have visitors with prior arrangements. The situation will be reviewed daily, and restrictions will be lifted once it's deemed safe. They appreciate everyone’s patience and support during this time.
