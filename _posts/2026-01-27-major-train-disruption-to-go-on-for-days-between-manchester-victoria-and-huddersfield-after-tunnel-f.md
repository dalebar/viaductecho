There’s a significant disruption to train services between Manchester Victoria and Huddersfield due to a fire in the Standedge Tunnel that occurred on Sunday, January 25. National Rail has announced that the disruption will last until 6am on Thursday, January 29, affecting services most severely between Manchester Victoria and Huddersfield. Once the fire was put out, damage was found in the tunnel, necessitating extensive repairs. 

Trains on this route may be cancelled, delayed, or diverted. Services between Manchester Victoria to Redcar Central, Liverpool Lime Street, Newcastle, and Hull are also impacted. For those travelling between Dewsbury and Huddersfield, rail replacement bus services are available, with some trains detouring via the Calder Valley but skipping several stations. Passengers heading to/from Manchester Airport will find additional stops at Brighouse in both directions.
