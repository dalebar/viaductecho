A former teacher from Greater Manchester, Rebecca Whitehurst, has been banned from the teaching profession for serious misconduct involving a 15-year-old pupil. Despite being cleared of sexual relations in 2022 due to the pupil's fabricated evidence, an investigation revealed inappropriate communication and meetings between the two. The Teaching Regulation Agency found that Whitehurst had exchanged thousands of messages, shared personal contact details, and received explicit images from the student, which constituted serious professional misconduct. The panel highlighted her failure to report concerning messages, including the pupilâ€™s expressions of suicidal thoughts, and her breach of professional boundaries. Although initially her intentions were deemed well-meaning, the panel ruled that her conduct risked harm to the vulnerable student and could damage public trust in teachers. Whitehurst, who can reapply for her ban to be reviewed in five years, has received an indefinite prohibition on teaching in England.
