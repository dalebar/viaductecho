Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has backed the Campaign for Gigi, which aims to improve nursery safety standards following the tragic death of Genevieve ‘Gigi’ Meehan at Tiny Toes Children’s Day Nursery. Gigi's parents, John Meehan and Katie Wheeler, are advocating for measures like compulsory CCTV in nurseries, unannounced Ofsted inspections, and mandatory safe sleep training for staff. Burnham expressed his heartbreak over Gigi's story while emphasising the need for safer environments for children. He highlighted that many parents may not realise how unregulated some early years settings are and called for more consistent safety standards. Greater Manchester is working on a safety action plan across its 10 districts, aiming to raise training standards and use CCTV for professional development rather than punishment. He compared the campaign to Martyn's Law, suggesting that increased awareness of regulations can give parents peace of mind. The Manchester Evening News is supporting this campaign, encouraging the public to engage with their local MPs to push for these vital changes in nursery safety.
