The Thursday after Ricky Hatton's passing, locals at the Cheshire Cheese pub in Gee Cross are enjoying drinks and chatting, carrying on as he would have liked. In the '90s, coach Paul Dunne at Sale West ABC celebrated a promising talent who would become a world champ. Meanwhile, Oasis, the band Hatton loved, was making Manchester a music hub. Hatton, a loyal Man City fan, truly 'united' the city, especially when he drew huge crowds for his fight with Floyd Mayweather in 2007. Beyond boxing, he was a dedicated ambassador for various charities, including Manchesterâ€™s Barnabus for the homeless and CALM for mental health.
