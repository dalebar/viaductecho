On a chilly Monday evening in Brinnington, the local bus service, the number 325, faced diversion due to anti-social behaviour, significantly affecting residents returning from work. Gangs of children have been throwing objects at buses, creating a sense of fear among locals. A resident highlighted how this ongoing issue is leaving people stranded and forcing them to pay for taxis. Updates and concerns are being shared in local Facebook groups, increasing frustration as many feel it unfairly tarnishes Brinnington's reputation. Despite these challenges, local teens believe the area isn’t dangerous; they suggest the rowdy behaviour is just a phase for the kids involved. Greater Manchester Police have initiated an investigation, collaborating with local authorities and schools to address the situation. Councillor Christine Carrigan confirmed ongoing efforts to tackle the disturbances, with Stagecoach prioritising the safety of their passengers as they work to restore full bus services. The community remains hopeful for improvement, balancing their worries with pride in their neighbourhood.
