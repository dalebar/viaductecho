It feels like a bit of a broken record discussing Manchester United's issues, especially after the recent match against City. They started strong, winning the ball back several times but lacked the finesse to convert those opportunities into goals. While Luke Shaw could have played better when the ball was in the box, the real culprit was Fernandes, who switched off and let Foden slip through. This isn't the first time he's not tracked back, as he also failed to mark Smith Rowe, costing them a goal against Fulham earlier this season. It’s clear that Fernandes isn’t the only player at United struggling to fit into the system. However, let’s not forget, their season hasn’t been all doom and gloom. They've had some decent performances, like nearly beating Arsenal and securing a win against Burnley, though they should've capitalised on chances against Fulham too.
