A former Greater Manchester Police officer, Dylan Hartley, has been deemed guilty of gross misconduct for using "disgusting and simply unacceptable" language. He resigned before a misconduct hearing which concluded he would have been sacked if he hadn't. The chair of the hearing, Lee Rawlinson, found Hartley's language to be "abhorrent" and agreed that it severely breached professional standards, potentially damaging public trust in the police. Though the specific language and context were not disclosed, it was asserted that Hartley's words were discriminatory and had a direct negative psychological impact on at least one victim. His behaviour, described as contrary to the values expected of a police officer, will land him on the College of Policing's 'Barred List,' preventing him from future police work.
