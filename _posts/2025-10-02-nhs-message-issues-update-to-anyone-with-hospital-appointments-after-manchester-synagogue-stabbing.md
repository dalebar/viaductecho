Greater Manchester's NHS is advising patients to only go to A&E in emergencies following a stabbing incident at a local synagogue. Despite this, anyone with hospital appointments today should attend as usual unless told otherwise. Several major hospitals, including Salford Royal and Royal Oldham, were briefly on lockdown as a precaution, which has since been lifted. The situation arose after five people were injured, with three in serious condition, and two tragically died. The suspect was reportedly shot dead by police. NHS Greater Manchester is working with emergency services to manage the incident's impact and has emphasised the importance of prioritising urgent cases in A&E. For guidance, the public is encouraged to contact NHS 111. The stabbing coincided with Yom Kippur, and Mayor Andy Burnham confirmed police were called shortly after 9.30 am as the incident unfolded.
