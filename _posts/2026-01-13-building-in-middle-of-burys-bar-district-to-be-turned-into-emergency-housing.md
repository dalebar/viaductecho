Plans are underway to convert vacant offices above The Monkey House bar on Silver Street in Bury into emergency housing for families facing homelessness. JDBR Investments LTD aims to transform the first and second floors into four modern flats, each featuring a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and a living area with a sofa-bed for kids. These new units will be linked to existing emergency accommodation nearby. Sam Golding, representing the developers, emphasised that these flats are geared towards local families in need, ensuring they stay connected within their community, especially schools. The project aligns with Bury Council's priorities amidst a rising housing crisis, which has increased demand for temporary accommodation. Currently, the council relies on costly B&Bs, but this local solution promises substantial savings, estimated at around £2m over five years. Importantly, the development will maintain the building's heritage with no external changes and minimal internal alterations, aiming to blend seamlessly into the conservation area.
