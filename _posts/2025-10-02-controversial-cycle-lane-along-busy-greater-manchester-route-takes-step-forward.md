The cycle lane project extending from Castleton to Rochdale town centre is hitting new strides with Phase 2 set to begin soon. After causing traffic chaos in Phase 1, locals hope for a smoother ride this time, especially since most work will happen on Old Manchester Road. The £13.5m Bee Network project aims to improve junctions along Manchester Road, adding pedestrian crossings and optimising traffic lights for quicker journeys. Upgrades around key areas like Highfield Hospital and new facilities for cyclists are promised. There’s also a freshly paved road and a safer crossing near Gipsy Lane, plus a new car park for Mandale Park and Beech House School. The next phase kicks off in early October, wrapping up by March 2026, with the entire project expected to finish in early 2027. Coun Shah Wazir from Rochdale Borough Council has high hopes for the transformative impact of these ambitious developments.
