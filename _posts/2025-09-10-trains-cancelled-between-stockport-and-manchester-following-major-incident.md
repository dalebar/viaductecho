There was a considerable disruption to train services between Stockport and Manchester on the evening of 6 September due to an incident at Levenshulme Station. The railway line was completely closed from about 7pm while emergency services attended the scene. This resulted in delays, cancellations, and changes to routes, with services only resuming around 11pm. However, the disruption lingered on for the rest of the day. Greater Manchester Police have been approached for further details.
