A Sainsbury's shopper recently caused a stir by finding a Thai Style Green Chicken Curry in a meal deal, leaving many fellow customers buzzing about it. Traditionally, Brits have strict ideas about meal deal combos, often going for sandwiches and crisps. But this curry, pre-heated and ready to eat, really shook things up. The shopper paired the curry with a Strawberries 'n' Cream Pepsi Max and a blueberry yoghurt, posting the discovery online. Responses ranged from excitement about the hot food options to discussions on whether the curry was properly heated and tasty. The original poster confirmed it was nice and hot, leading to comments praising the combo and speculating about Sainsbury's future meal deal offerings. Sainsbury's meal deals typically cost around £3.95, with the curry priced at £5.50 for the more premium items. Other fancy options include steak sandwiches and posh salads, appealing to those wanting a bit more than the usual fare.
