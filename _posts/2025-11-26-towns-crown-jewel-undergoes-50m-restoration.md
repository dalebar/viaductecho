The £50m redevelopment of a country house and gardens at a historical estate in Greater Manchester has kicked off. The aim is to create an affordable restaurant for the people of Wigan, avoiding overpriced dishes. Alongside this, renovations are underway for Bothy Yard and the walled kitchen garden at Haigh Hall, which will be used to educate horticultural students. Additionally, repairs will start on the ornamental pond, involving careful fish removal, draining the water, and maintaining the fountain.
