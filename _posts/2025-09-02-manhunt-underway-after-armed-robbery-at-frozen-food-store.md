A manhunt is on for a robber who held up a Heron Foods frozen food store in Farnworth at gunpoint on Monday afternoon. Witnesses reported the suspect waving the gun before fleeing with cash. Police were alerted at 4.38pm and quickly cordoned off the area, launching an investigation. Thankfully, no injuries have been reported. Officers are actively working to track down the offender. A local posted a video on Facebook, expressing disbelief at the robbery, especially given that most people pay with cards nowadays.
