A manhunt's on for a robber who staged a daylight heist at a frozen food store in Farnworth, brandishing a gun and making off with cash. Witnesses saw him waving the weapon as he fled Heron Foods on Brackley Street on Monday afternoon. Police arrived shortly after, cordoning off the shop for an investigation. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the Greater Manchester Police have confirmed that efforts to track down the suspect are ongoing. One local, William Hawarth, shared a video of the scene, reflecting on the oddity of robbing shops nowadays when most transactions are cashless.
