Scott Holding, a 22-year-old defender for Macclesfield FC, is feeling pretty frustrated after his belongings were stolen from a secure locker at David Lloyd in Trafford. On December 15, he locked up his pricey Louis Vuitton rucksack and washbag before heading to the spa. When he returned, he found his things ransacked but the padlock intact. Another member, Richard, faced the same issue, losing his Louis Vuitton holdall as well. Scott suspects the thief watched him input his code. After reporting the incident to the gym, they were told the CCTV footage couldn’t be shared due to GDPR rules. David Lloyd expressed regret over the incident but Scott feels they’ve not taken enough responsibility. He highlighted that members paying premium prices should expect better security. When he attempted to report the theft to local police, his appointment was cancelled due to an administration mix-up. Scott has noticed other members share similar safety concerns, asking why the gym hasn’t taken action if this is a recurring problem. Greater Manchester Police have been contacted for further comments.
