Emergency services responded to a serious road traffic accident in Rochdale on December 4, involving two cars at the junction of Bolton Road and Eskdale Avenue. A woman was rescued from one vehicle and taken to hospital, while four others were treated at the scene. Road closures were implemented, and residents were advised to steer clear of the area. Ali from Cube Desserts, a nearby shop, reported seeing multiple emergency vehicles and mentioned someone was trapped in their car. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service sent two fire engines and the enhanced rescue unit to handle the incident, using specialist equipment to free the injured woman and ensuring the scene was safe. They remained on site for about an hour and a half before handing over to the police. Further updates are expected as the situation develops.
