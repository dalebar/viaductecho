Following the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, a senior judge approved almost £20m in damages for 16 claims from children and individuals unable to represent themselves. The largest settlement was nearly £11.4m for a teen with catastrophic injuries. The money will come from Greater Manchester Police, British Transport Police, Arena operators SMG (now Legends Global Services Limited), and security firm Showsec, though how much each will pay remains confidential. A public inquiry found serious shortcomings in security on the night of the attack, and the defendants have since apologised to the victims and their families, acknowledging their failures. A total of 352 more claims await finalisation, with the aim of preventing similar tragedies in the future. Judge Nigel Bird noted the extraordinary courage of the claimants throughout the process, emphasising that while the settlements can’t heal the wounds, they represent accountability and a commitment to improvement. Legal representatives for the claimants expressed it has been a privilege to work with such brave individuals as they look forward to a more peaceful future.
