Bury Market in Greater Manchester has received brand-new over-sailing canopies as part of a massive £33m regeneration project, finished a whole 10 weeks early—perfect timing for the festive rush! These snazzy steel-and-timber structures not only boost the market's visibility but also offer better weather protection for everyone. Main contractor VINCI Building kept the market running smoothly during the year-long installation. Alongside the canopies, they’re also working on a new flexi hall, funded largely by a levelling up grant, which will host entertainment and more food options. The project is backed by £20m from the UK Government and £13m from Bury Council. Council leader Eamonn O’Brien expressed confidence that this investment will keep the market thriving while attracting new visitors. With public improvements set to kick off soon and a target completion by mid-2026, big changes are afoot for Bury! Additional investments from the Greater Manchester Good Growth Fund will further enhance the area, including an £80m overhaul of Bury Interchange and the transformation of Prestwich village centre. Exciting times ahead for Bury!
