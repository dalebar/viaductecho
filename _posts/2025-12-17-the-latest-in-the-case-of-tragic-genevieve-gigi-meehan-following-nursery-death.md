A coroner is reviewing the nursery culture after the tragic death of nine-month-old Genevieve 'Gigi' Meehan at Tiny Toes Day Nursery in Cheadle Hulme in May 2022. Staff member Kate Roughley swaddled and left Gigi on a bean bag for over an hour, leading to her manslaughter conviction and a 14-year sentence. Another former worker, Rebecca Gregory, was also found guilty of child abuse and received a 3.5-year jail term. During a pre-inquest review, Genevieve's family and representatives discussed the nursery's culture and requested to hear more about Gregory’s actions and past complaints against the nursery. While Genevieve's family's legal rep pushed for Gregory to be included in the inquest, Ofsted and the former nursery owners argued this was outside the inquest's focus. The senior coroner will decide how to proceed with Gregory's involvement. Additional hearings are set for March and April 2024.
