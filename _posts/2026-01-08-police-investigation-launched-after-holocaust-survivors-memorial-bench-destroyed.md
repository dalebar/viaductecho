Police are investigating the destruction of a memorial bench dedicated to Holocaust survivor Chaim Ferster in Clowes Park, Salford. The bench, which featured an audio recording of Mr. Ferster's experiences during the Holocaust, was found smashed and dumped in a frozen lake, prompting claims of antisemitic hatred from the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Mr. Ferster, who survived multiple concentration camps, moved to Manchester after World War II and dedicated his later years to educating schoolchildren about the Holocaust. The incident has been condemned by local groups, emphasising the importance of remembering Mr. Ferster's story and fighting against hatred. Greater Manchester Police are treating the vandalism seriously and are currently investigating to identify those responsible.
