Andy Burnham has taken aim at the British Transport Police (BTP) over their approach to investigating bike thefts at train stations. The BTP has announced it will only review up to two hours of CCTV footage for such incidents, arguing longer reviews distract officers from other urgent duties. This decision has prompted Burnham and Stockport councillors to express their concerns, signalling that it could embolden bike thieves and discourage commuters from cycling. They argue this effectively decriminalises bike theft, which could push people back into cars. 

While the BTP insists bike theft hasn't been decriminalised and claims their practices are meant to focus resources where they're needed most, critics like Harry Gray from Walk Ride GM suggest advancements like AI could assist in reviewing footage more efficiently. The police are also exploring ways to enhance their CCTV capabilities and collaborate with rail companies to prevent bike thefts, striving to create a less inviting environment for thieves.
