Rochdale council has appointed Julie Murphy as interim chief executive following the suspension of James Binks over allegations of 'inappropriate behaviour'. This decision comes after an internal investigation by Manchester council, where Binks previously worked as assistant chief executive. Council leader Neil Emmott suspended Binks after reviewing a redacted internal report. There were questions from opposition councillors about the timing of the suspension, but Emmott stated he acted promptly after seeking legal advice, maintaining that proper procedures were followed. The council became aware of the investigation in early October, but details were only shared internally later. In a letter to council members, Emmott expressed the need to uphold the council's reputation and highlighted the importance of high standards for staff. Binks has reportedly apologised for his behaviour but firmly denies any sexual misconduct.
