Police in north Manchester are linking two nearby shootings that occurred last night. The first incident happened on Ainthorpe Walk, where a man sustained minor head injuries, possibly from a bullet, though it's believed he wasn't the target. Meanwhile, the second confirmed shooting occurred on Ballantine Street, just 700 yards away, with no reported injuries. Both locations have visible damage from bullet holes, and a cordon is in place for safety. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are actively investigating and are appealing for witnesses or anyone with footage to step forward. Having extra patrols in the area, they are keen to establish the circumstances surrounding these concerning events. Detective Inspector Terina Arthern emphasised the seriousness of the incidents and urged the community to assist with any information. If anyone has details, they can contact GMP via phone or their website, or reach out anonymously to Crimestoppers.
