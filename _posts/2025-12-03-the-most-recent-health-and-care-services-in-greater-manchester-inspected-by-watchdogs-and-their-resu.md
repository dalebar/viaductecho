Two care services in Greater Manchester were inspected by the CQC recently, with one rated ‘requires improvement’ due to concerns over care quality and staff training. 

Comprehensive Care Limited, which supports people with learning disabilities, received a 'good' rating despite a minor compliance issue regarding notifications. Staff were praised for promoting independence and respect for individuals.

Marantomark Limited, a nursing home for up to 77 residents, also got a 'good' rating, having made significant improvements in safety and care plans. 

Meanwhile, Denmax Limited's Richard House Care Home showed substantial progress and was rated 'good' after previous breaches. 

O2 Care, providing support for mental health conditions, was rated 'requires improvement' after the inspection revealed multiple breaches, particularly in staff training and care records.

The Advanced Hair Technology Limited and Kings Dental Centre both received an 'outstanding' and 'good' rating, respectively, for their services. Lastly, T.H.O.M.A.S. in Salford was rated 'requires improvement', needing better oversight and cleanliness, despite positive feedback from residents. Overall, some services are doing well while others still need to enhance their practices.
