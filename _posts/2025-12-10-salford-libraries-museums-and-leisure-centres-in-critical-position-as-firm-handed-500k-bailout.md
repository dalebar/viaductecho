Salford Community Leisure (SCL) is facing dire financial issues, leading to a £500,000 emergency bailout from Salford Council to avoid insolvency. Once boasting reserves of £3.3 million, these are on track to run dry by 2025/26, primarily due to rising staff and maintenance costs. This is SCL's second emergency funding this year, following an earlier £350,000 support. The financial strain is exacerbated by an unresolved £250,000 insurance claim for Clarendon Leisure Centre, which suffered a fire last year. The council stressed the need for long-term financial stability, with an emphasis on strategic efficiencies and income growth. Mayor Paul Dennett acknowledged the challenges SCL faces, linking them to over a decade of austerity and cuts. Despite the tough situation, customer income from fitness services is reportedly on the rise, suggesting some hope for recovery.
