Manchester City star Erling Haaland's football boot has been turned into a colossal six-metre-long replica for display. This record-breaking boot debuted at a Football Beyond Borders event in Manchester before being showcased at the National Football Museum on September 20 and 21. Dubbed 'Too Big To Miss' by Nike, it measures 2.45 metres in height and 2.02 metres in width, making it a whopping UK size 672—70 times larger than Haaland’s actual kicks. The stunning design features a bright 'laser orange, lemon venom and blue void' colour scheme. Tim Desmond from the museum expressed excitement about this significant addition, perfect for photo ops. Fans can also enjoy other exhibits at the museum, including a chance to snap pics with replica trophies and engage in interactive games like a Penalty Shootout and a VR experience. Admission is free for Manchester residents, while tickets for others are priced at £15 for adults and £9 for children aged 5 to 15, with little ones under five entering for free.
