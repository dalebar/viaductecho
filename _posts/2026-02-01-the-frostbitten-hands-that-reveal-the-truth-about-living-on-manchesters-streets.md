Sivi, a 34-year-old Sudanese refugee, has spent eight months living in a makeshift tent in Manchester, suffering from the harsh conditions and frostbite. Despite having legal status in the UK, he was evicted from Home Office accommodation and has faced the realities of a failing asylum system. The city has seen a surge in rough sleeping among refugees, with many arriving from war-torn regions like Sudan, seeking dignity and safety. 

Sivi's frustrations reflect a broader crisis as thousands of refugees are left homeless after their asylum claims are approved, often facing a tight 28-day deadline to find housing and work. Charities like the Mustard Tree are struggling to support this growing number while dealing with a system that limits refugees' access to training and employment. 

The Manchester Council is actively clearing encampments but many remain, with the task of providing adequate support complicated by language barriers and mistrust in authorities. The city’s reputation for kindness attracts refugees, yet they still encounter significant challenges in finding stability and basic necessities.
