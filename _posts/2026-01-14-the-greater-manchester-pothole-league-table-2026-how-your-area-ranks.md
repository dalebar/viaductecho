Greater Manchester's councils are under the spotlight for their pothole management, with a new government report rating their performance from green to red based on road conditions, spending, and adherence to best practices. Manchester council spent the most on maintenance (£25.514m), but Salford filled the highest number of potholes (18,200). Manchester and Wigan received green ratings, reflecting well-maintained roads, while Bolton received a red rating due to a reported data error. Many councils, including Bury and Rochdale, reported struggles with government funding impacting road conditions but are actively investing in improvements. Overall, only 16 councils in the UK earned green ratings, highlighting the need for ongoing transparency and support for local authorities to enhance road maintenance.
