Tim Kerr, a doctor, was stopped at Manchester Airport in 2016 after returning from a ski festival in Austria. He and his university friend Adrian Tickridge-Day were involved in buying drugs from the dark web. Customs found a package with 220 ecstasy tablets linked to Day, who had £2,000 in cash and other drug paraphernalia at his home. Kerr was sentenced to 56 months in prison for drug-related offences in 2018 and subsequently struck off the medical register. After being released in 2020, he expressed deep shame for his actions and sought to return to medical practice, highlighting his work with charities and therapy sessions. Supporters praised his efforts towards rehabilitation, but the General Medical Council argued his crimes were too serious for reinstatement. The MPTS panel acknowledged his insight into his past actions but ruled he hadn’t sufficiently shown his medical skills were up-to-date, citing a potential risk to patient safety.
