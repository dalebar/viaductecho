A concert-goer reported witnessing at least 10 medical help requests during Raye's February 18 gig at Co-op Live in Manchester, describing the crowd as feeling like a packed festival. She shared a video showing multiple groups calling for medics, with some attendees carried out by staff, suggesting they were unwell. Another attendee confirmed seeing similar situations the night before, noting the audience was very tightly packed, which raised concerns about safety. While the fan expressed worries about the number of incidents, Co-op Live stated there was no overcrowding and a “small number” of medical teams were present, attributing the incidents to over-excitement rather than a lack of safety measures.
