This week in Greater Manchester, several offenders were sentenced, including a chess champion and a 77-year-old paedophile. Paul Keevil, 55, was jailed for 28 months for stalking a woman after she turned down his advances, resorting to blackmail and threats if she didn't rekindle their affair. Two teenage thugs, Bilal Jama and Michael Ogbeide-John, aged 17, used fake identities on Facebook Marketplace to lure victims before robbing and attacking them, receiving sentences for multiple robbery counts. Meanwhile, Jack Platt was sentenced to 45 months for grooming and sexually assaulting a teenage girl, while David Dyet received 18 months for violently attacking his partner. Finally, Allan Sice, a father from Oldham, was extradited from Brazil and sentenced to 16 years for planning to import over 100 kilos of cocaine into the UK.
