Following a terror-related attack outside the Heaton Park synagogue in Crumpsall, Greater Manchester, on October 2, additional police officers will be deployed at synagogues nationwide. The incident, which occurred around 9.30 am during Yom Kippur, involved a car driving into a crowd and a security guard being stabbed, resulting in injuries to four people. Armed police shot the suspect, who was later confirmed dead, along with another victim who has since died. Sir Keir Starmer expressed his shock and commitment to ensuring the safety of the Jewish community, stating that police presence would be heightened. Local Jewish organisation, Community Security Trust, is collaborating with law enforcement in response to the situation. GMP responded swiftly, declaring a major incident just minutes after being alerted. Residents are advised to stay clear of the area as investigations continue.
