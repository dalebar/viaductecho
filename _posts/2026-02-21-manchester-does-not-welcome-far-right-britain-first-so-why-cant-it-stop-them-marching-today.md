Today in Manchester city centre, the far-right party Britain First is set to march from Piccadilly Station under the controversial banner of 'remigration', which implies mass deportation. Council leader Bev Craig has condemned their presence, stating that hate and division have no place in the city. In response, various anti-racist and anti-fascist groups are organising counter-demonstrations, with Jeremy Corbyn MP expected to speak. While Britain First claims to promote patriotism without racism, critics argue their views have become increasingly overtly racist. Their aims include deporting all illegal immigrants and offering financial incentives for voluntary repatriation. The local community is expressing alarm, recalling previous marches that resulted in disruptions and incidents of hate. Despite strong opposition, UK law protects the right to protest, limiting what authorities can do. Greater Manchester Police are introducing measures to ensure public safety amidst anticipated tensions. The situation is politically charged, coinciding with upcoming local elections where immigration is a hot topic. Ultimately, while Britain First may have the right to march, Manchester city leaders and many residents clearly do not welcome them.
