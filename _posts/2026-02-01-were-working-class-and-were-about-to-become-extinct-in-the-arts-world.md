Greater Manchester artists are facing poverty as the music scene is increasingly dominated by wealthier individuals, primarily from the south, according to local musicians and venue managers. A recent report indicates that the arts sector has become "too posh," making it difficult for working-class talent to thrive. Many artists, like Thom Rylance from Lottery Winners, lament the unequal access to opportunities, asserting that financial struggles limit the potential of many aspiring musicians. Grassroots venues are also struggling, with rising costs making it hard to support underfunded artists. Jonny Booth from The Castle Hotel stresses that art should not become exclusive to the affluent. The Class Ceiling report, led by Nazir Afzal, highlights systemic barriers faced by working-class individuals, including a flawed education system that stifles creativity. There’s a call to invest in educational resources and support local talent to ensure a diverse and vibrant artistic future. Initiatives like Factory Academy aim to address underrepresentation in the arts and create pathways for working-class individuals. The overarching message is clear: without support and equitable access, Greater Manchester risks losing invaluable artistic voices.
