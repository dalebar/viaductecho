Today in Stockport, expect a mix of sun and clouds, making it a decent day for getting outside. Temperatures are set to range from a comfy 13°C to a warm 20°C, with the humidity sitting at 73%. There’s a 32% chance of a light shower or two, but nothing too disruptive, and breezy winds could hit around 25 mph, so keep that in mind.

If you're heading out, it might be a good idea to take a light rain jacket or an umbrella, and dress a bit warmer if you’re cycling or walking, thanks to the wind chill. Overall, it’s a brilliant day for outdoor fun, but stay flexible with your plans just in case some rain pops up. Perfect weather for a stroll in the park or checking out local spots without the usual heavy heat or downpours! Enjoy!
