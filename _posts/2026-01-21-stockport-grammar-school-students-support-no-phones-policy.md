Stockport Grammar School's new no-phones policy has been a hit with students and parents alike since its September 2025 launch. Headteacher Sarah Capewell introduced the policy to boost engagement and encourage socialising during breaks. Pupils have reported enjoying more time with friends and staying focused in lessons. Most students prefer this system and don't want to bring their phones back. The school uses Yondr pouches to store phones securely during the day, with exceptions for medical needs. Parents are largely supportive, averaging a 4.2 out of 5 in agreement regarding the policy, even if phone usage at home hasn't changed. Feedback from students highlights the positive impacts on social interactions, with some opting for outdoor games like table tennis and football.
