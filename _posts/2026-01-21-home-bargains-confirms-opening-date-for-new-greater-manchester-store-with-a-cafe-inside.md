Home Bargains is set to open a new store in Leigh, Wigan, on February 21, featuring its own café. This development, replacing the old B&Q site on Kirkhall Lane, was approved by Wigan Council back in 2022. It marks the second Home Bargains in Greater Manchester with a café, the first being in Bolton. Previous visits to their cafés showed impressive value for money with a menu boasting breakfast rolls, toasties, and sweet treats, all at budget-friendly prices. Currently, there are only 43 Home Bargains with cafés across the UK. The new Leigh location will also include a Garden World section and will be the third store in the area, joining others at Parsonage Retail Park and Bradshawgate. Home Bargains continues to thrive, reporting a turnover of £4.5 billion for the 2024/25 financial year, attributed to frequent new openings and greater sales.
