Councillors are set to approve an extra £95m for the refurbishment of Manchester Town Hall in an upcoming meeting. Garry Bridges, the deputy leader, expressed frustration over the delays and rising costs but reassured that no more funds should be required after this. This new funding request follows a previous ask for £76m last year. The town hall has been closed for renovations since 2018, with initial costs estimated at £330m and a planned reopening in 2024.
