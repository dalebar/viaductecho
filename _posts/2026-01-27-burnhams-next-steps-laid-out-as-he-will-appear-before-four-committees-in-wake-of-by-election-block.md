Andy Burnham's recent attempt to stand for the Gorton and Denton MP seat has stirred up quite a fuss. He applied for permission to enter the by-election after Andrew Gwynne's resignation but faced a setback as Labour's National Executive Committee blocked his application. Burnham expressed his disappointment on social media but has kept mum since, urging Labour MPs to support the party's candidate instead. 

In the coming days, he'll be in the spotlight, attending several Greater Manchester Combined Authority meetings. He'll present proposals for council tax increases to support the fire service, face scrutiny on similar tax plans, and chair discussions on improving road safety and active travel. By the week's end, he'll meet with the region's council leaders to discuss various significant agendas, including tax rises and new development corporations. Despite his earlier frustration, Burnham is promoting unity among Labour MPs, emphasising the significance of collaboration in Greater Manchester ahead of the upcoming by-election.
