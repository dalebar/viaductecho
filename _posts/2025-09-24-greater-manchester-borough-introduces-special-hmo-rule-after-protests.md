Oldham Council is tackling the rise of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) by introducing a borough-wide Article 4 Direction. This new rule will require developers to seek planning permission for any property conversion into HMOs, except for those housing over six people. Locals have protested, claiming HMOs are ruining community character and overtaking high street buildings like banks and pubs. While only 384 out of approximately 98,912 homes in Oldham are currently HMOs, certain areas, like Failsworth and Shaw, have significant concentrations. The council acknowledges that HMOs can help provide housing for young people and single residents, yet poorly managed ones can harm local areas. The directive aims to manage these issues and prevent overcrowding of HMOs. Public consultation begins on September 29, with the new rules set to take effect from January 1, 2026. This wonâ€™t be a blanket ban but will ensure planning permission is needed for smaller HMOs, allowing for better oversight and management of the housing landscape in Oldham.
