This morning (January 20), multiple train routes in Manchester have been disrupted due to a broken-down train. Northern Rail reported that the line between Wigan Wallgate and Southport is blocked, causing cancellations and delays for affected services. Maintenance teams are working on fixing the issue. In the meantime, Northern Rail has announced that tickets can be used for free on Merseyrail services between Southport and Liverpool Central until 11:00am. The disrupted routes include Manchester Victoria to Southport, Stalybridge to Southport, Manchester Oxford Road to Southport, and Wigan Wallgate to Southport.
