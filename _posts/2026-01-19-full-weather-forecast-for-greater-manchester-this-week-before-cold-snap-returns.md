This week in Greater Manchester is looking fairly settled but brace yourselves for a cold snap coming soon! Today kicks off with mist and light showers, hitting a high of 10C, which is pretty standard for January. Tuesday's your best bet for nice weather, with some sunny intervals again around 10C. However, Wednesday and Thursday are back to light showers, with highs dropping to 9C. Friday will be overcast, also at 9C, and come Sunday, we’re looking at just 5C as colder temperatures roll in.

After recent wintry weather from Storm Goretti, we’ve seen milder conditions lately, but forecasters suggest a chilly shift by the end of January. They reckon we could see a tussle between milder Atlantic air and colder Eastern systems, with a chance of snow reappearing. Keep an eye out, as it's still a bit uncertain, but things could turn wintry again!
