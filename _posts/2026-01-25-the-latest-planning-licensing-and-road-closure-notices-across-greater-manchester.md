Greater Manchester is buzzing with new developments! A proposed waste recovery centre in Bolton aims to handle most of the city-region’s recycling, replacing the old facility in Sharston. Meanwhile, in Heywood, plans are underway for 1,000 homes, starting with 186 houses off Hareshill Road. Developers are also eyeing a former pub in Fallowfield, transforming it into flats and a retail space. 

In Oldham, a road is shut for emergency gas pipeline works, while Stockport is set to demolish the derelict Victoria House for new homes. Stalybridge will experience major town centre upgrades starting February, making it greener and more welcoming. 

Partington and Carrington are gearing up for a 2.7-mile relief road to alleviate traffic woes, and a new boutique cinema, The Northern Light, is coming to Stretford, promising a unique experience. Additionally, Wigan Council is looking to sell a green land plot in Atherton for housing development. It's all happening across Greater Manchester as these projects aim to boost the community and economy!
