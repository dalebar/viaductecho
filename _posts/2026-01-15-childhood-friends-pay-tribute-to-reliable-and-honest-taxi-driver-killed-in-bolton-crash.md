Mates of Masrob Ali, a taxi driver killed in a devastating crash in Bolton, came together to honour their dependable friend at his funeral. The 54-year-old lost his life when his Citroen was struck head-on by a Seat Leon on Wigan Road. Friends remembered him as a "really nice lad" who was kind, honest, and always there for others. Growing up in Blackburn after emigrating from Bangladesh at 12, Masrob and his mates shared plenty of laughs and football, as well as early jobs in local restaurants. He later returned to Bangladesh, where he met his wife, Husna, before settling back in Blackburn to raise their family, including a child on the way. His pals spoke fondly of their close-knit bond, saying he never let anyone down. Tragically, Masrob is one of four fatalities from the crash that also claimed the lives of three teenagers in the other vehicle. Police are still investigating the incident and are seeking information from the public.
