Greater Manchester is starting the week with freezing temperatures, dipping well below zero. While folk might be tempted to crank up the heating, many are likely to stay indoors. The Met Office predicts crisp winter sunshine today, alongside the chance of a few snow flurries in the Pennines. Expect temperatures to struggle around freezing, peaking at just 2C, with a bitterly cold night ahead, plunging to around -7C and severe frost. Tuesday's forecast shows another chilly start, with the day mainly dry but a few isolated wintry showers expected, possibly turning into light snow later. Temperatures will be a bit milder, maxing out at about 5C. Early mornings will still be frigid, with temperatures often around -4C, rising to just 1C by early afternoon. Stay warm out there!
