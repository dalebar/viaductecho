Sara Moosa, a 24-year-old woman from Astley Bridge, Bolton, tragically died after a car crash on Chorley Old Road last Tuesday evening. GMP reported that she may have lost control of her vehicle due to a medical episode, leading to her car colliding with a wall. Emergency services, including an air ambulance, responded quickly but sadly pronounced her dead at the scene. The Manchester West Coroner's Office confirmed her death was due to natural causes, so no further investigation was needed.
