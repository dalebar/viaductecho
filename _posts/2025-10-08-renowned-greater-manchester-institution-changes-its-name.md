St Ann's Hospice has officially changed its name to Moya Cole Hospice as of October 1, 2023, to honour its founder, Dr Moya Cole. Established in 1971, the hospice aims to remain culturally relevant while it opens a new state-of-the-art facility in Heald Green. While the change marks an important milestone, many locals have expressed that it will always be St Ann's to them, reminiscing about its long history of care in Greater Manchester. Social media reactions ranged from nostalgia to suggestions on alternative ways to commemorate Dr Cole, like naming a unit after her instead of a full rebranding. The hospice management acknowledged these sentiments but emphasised that the quality of care will stay consistent despite the name change. Dr Cole, a pioneering figure in hospice care and cancer research, played a crucial role in creating the service and advocating for patients. The hospice reassures the community that its commitment to providing outstanding care is unchanged, looking to the future with respect for its legacy.
