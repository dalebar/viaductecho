Stockport Development Limited has been fined £45,000 after the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) discovered multiple health and safety violations at their construction site. Inspections revealed issues like a lack of fire alarms, cluttered walkways, and inadequate welfare for workers. This wasn't the first warning for the company; they’d had four previous visits highlighting similar risks, leading to an HSE investigation that confirmed their disregard for safety protocols. HSE Inspector Claire Whitehurst expressed concern over the company's lack of consideration for worker and public safety. She emphasised that HSE will take enforcement action against those failing to meet safety standards, regardless of whether any incidents occurred.
