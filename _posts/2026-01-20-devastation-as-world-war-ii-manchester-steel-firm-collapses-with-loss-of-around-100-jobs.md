A historic steel firm, Thomas Storey Fabrications in Openshaw, has collapsed, leaving around 100 employees without jobs. Established in the 1930s and known for producing Bailey bridges for WWII, the company had a varied client base in construction and agriculture. After narrowly avoiding administration six months ago, staff were recently informed they would not be working until January, only to be told last week that the company had entered administration again, resulting in immediate redundancies. Jimmy McGuinness, a worker with 18 years' service, expressed deep disappointment, noting the close-knit community among staff. The GMB union, representing some workers, highlighted the lack of transparency from the firm, especially after previously promising job security just months prior. Employees are now directed to the Redundancy Payments Service for compensation, with many, including Jimmy, actively seeking new jobs. The situation has left workers feeling devastated, having not even had a proper chance to say goodbye to their colleagues. The Manchester Evening News has attempted to contact both the company and the administrators for further comment.
