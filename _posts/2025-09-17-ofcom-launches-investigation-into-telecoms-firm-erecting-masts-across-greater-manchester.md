Ofcom's kicked off a second investigation into IX Wireless, a telecoms company operating around Greater Manchester. This follows past enforcement action in Bolton over issues with equipment like antennas and poles, and problems in Oldham and Sale. The latest probe is linked to a 15-metre mast in Rochdale. Ofcom’s looking into whether IX Wireless has complied with regulations regarding the height of communication lines along roads and whether they’ve properly inspected and maintained their equipment. Under the Electronic Communications Code, they must keep lines at least 5.5 metres above the ground and ensure safety to the public and property. Ofcom might take further enforcement action if it finds any breaches. An update on the investigation will be shared later. The Manchester Evening News has reached out to IX Wireless for a response.
