Stockport train station is set for a major redevelopment aimed at improving access and usability. Over £4 million in government funding backs this project, which emerged after local concerns about the station’s condition were raised by MP Navendu Mishra. Proposed upgrades include better pedestrian connections and a new shortcut ramp from Thompson Street, as well as improved platforms and commuter services. The redevelopment involves collaboration between Stockport council, Transport for Greater Manchester, Network Rail, and Avanti West Coast. Council leader Mark Roberts emphasised that transforming the station is key to boosting jobs and investment, enhancing Stockport’s connectivity. This redevelopment is part of a larger £1 billion regeneration scheme in the town centre, which also includes a new transport interchange and plans for thousands of new homes and retail spaces. Exciting times ahead for Stockport!
