Stockport train station is set for a major redevelopment aimed at improving accessibility and usage. Backed by over £4m in government funding, the initial plans were prompted by concerns from local MP Navendu Mishra and Edgeley councillors regarding the station's condition. Proposed changes include better pedestrian access, a new ramp connection from Thompson Street, and enhancements to the platform and services for commuters. 

The project is a collaboration between Stockport council, Transport for Greater Manchester, Network Rail, and Avanti West Coast, with council leader Mark Roberts emphasising the importance of the station reflecting its status on one of Europe's busiest rail lines. This redevelopment is seen as a vital opportunity to boost jobs and investment while contributing to ongoing regeneration efforts in Stockport’s town centre, which includes a £1bn scheme for new housing and commercial spaces. Residents and stakeholders are keen to see these changes come to fruition.
