Renting in Greater Manchester is getting pricier, with average private rents climbing to £1,317 a month—an annual rise of 5.1%. This spike outpaces wage growth, which sits at 4.8%, raising concerns from housing charities about potential homelessness. Over the last five years, rents in Manchester have nearly tripled, adding £383 since August 2020. Tameside tops the list for annual rent growth, hitting an average of £885 per month after a 10.8% increase.

Ben Twomey from Generation Rent highlighted that rising rents are eating into incomes, pushing many into hardship and temporary housing. He argued for government intervention to cap rent increases, similar to energy and water bill protections.

Here’s a quick snapshot of the latest average rents in Greater Manchester boroughs, showing varying annual changes. If you want to see how your local area compares, there’s an interactive map available.
