The historic Apsley Cottage pub in Manchester has shut down for good, confirming concerns from local heritage advocates. Located near the Manchester Apollo, it has been a beloved spot for musicians and concert goers alike, hosting stars like Abba and Oasis. With its closure, owners Admiral Taverns are considering selling the property, raising fears of potential demolition. However, there’s a rallying cry from rock stars and heritage organisations, including SAVE Britain’s Heritage, pushing to get the building listed to protect its future. Community figures like Steve Speakman from the Manchester Civic Society and musician Gary ‘Mani’ Mounfield are vocal in their support for preserving the pub's rich history. The Apsley Cottage dates back nearly 200 years and is hailed for its architectural and cultural significance, representing a slice of Manchester's vibrant music scene. Over 2,000 people have signed a petition to save the pub, underscoring its importance to the community. Despite a key historic landmark potentially being at risk, efforts are underway to secure its legacy.
