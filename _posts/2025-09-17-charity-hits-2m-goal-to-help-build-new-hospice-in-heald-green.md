St Ann's Hospice has successfully raised £2 million for its new facility in Heald Green, with construction kick-started in June 2023. Community fundraising efforts—from sponsored walks to marathons—have played a huge role in reaching this target. The new hospice will feature a 27-bed inpatient unit with en-suite rooms, outdoor terraces, modern outpatient services, and special spaces for bereavement and family support, marking a significant upgrade from the current facilities. Anne-Marie Wynne, the Head of Fundraising, expressed gratitude for the overwhelming community support that has driven the Build it Together appeal, leading to this milestone. The development is nearing completion, thanks to the generosity of the local community.
