A 'suspicious bag' left unattended near Spinningfields caused a bit of a stir in Manchester today. Workers were evacuated and businesses shut down as emergency services cordoned off Bridge Street for about an hour. The bag was found between Deansgate and Chapel Street in Salford. Notable closures included Tesco Express and Caffe Nero. Greater Manchester Police secured the area while they investigated, but thankfully, the bag was eventually found to contain just a microphone and some singing equipment. The situation was deemed safe and the cordon was lifted around 10.50am after emergency services had a look. Multiple fire engines and police were on the scene, but there was no need for a bomb disposal team.
