Greater Manchester could see more snow as the freezing weather persists today, with the Met Office warning of cold conditions, sleet, and snow showers until late morning. Following some snowfall over the weekend, more could hit around 10am, though it might be mixed with rain. Temperatures have dipped to nearly -6C overnight and are expected to peak at just 3C, feeling more like -3C due to wind chill. A yellow weather warning for snow and ice is active until 11am, potentially causing travel disruptions. Notably, a school closure and delays across roads and rail occurred yesterday due to the weather conditions. The amber cold-health alert from the UK Health Security Agency warns of increased strain on health services due to the low temperatures, with a rise in potential health risks. This chilly spell is likely to continue, with the Met Office indicating that severe weather alerts may change throughout the week. Stay warm and keep an eye on those forecasts!
