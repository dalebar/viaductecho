This weekend in Stockport, there’s loads happening! Kicking things off on Thursday, check out the Climate Cuts Film Event at Brinksway Cinema Club, featuring shorts on community resilience in the face of climate change. Tickets available! 

Later that evening, head over to Thread for "Louvre and Let Live", a comedy murder mystery where you pick the characters in a night full of dark humour and intrigue. 

Music lovers should pop by The Spinning Top, which has free gigs all weekend, showcasing acts like Mary Bolt, SNM, Lillith's Army, and more! 

Friday brings the St Barnabas Community Café for some free drinks and snacks, and from Saturday to the next week, don’t miss "Dangerous Corner" at Chads Theatre, a gripping play that delves into the complexities of truth. 

Make sure to check out more events in the What's On section, and if you’ve got something happening, submit it!
