Oxford Road Cafe in Altrincham, a cherished spot for 15 years, will close for good on December 23 due to rising costs and lack of government support. The owners expressed their heartfelt thanks to the community, inviting customers to join them for a final farewell and celebration of memories created together. They shared the difficult decision to shut down, emphasising that the cafe was more than a business; it was a home and community hub filled with laughter and friendships. Thanks to the community, they've gained numerous glowing reviews, with many praising the friendly atmosphere, attentive staff, and delicious food. As they approach their final days, the team hopes to see loyal patrons come in, share memories, and give ORC the send-off it deserves. Support has poured in online, with many expressing their sadness and well-wishes as the cafe prepares to close its doors after a remarkable run.
