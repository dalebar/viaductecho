Head down to Decathlon's new workshop for a free bike diagnosis to prep for winter commuting or wet trails. They’ve got bike services starting at £39.99 to sort any issues or confirm your ride is ready to roll. You can either book ahead or pop in when it suits you. 

If you’re chasing snow, they also service skis and snowboards from just £34.99, so you're all set to glide. Check out the workshop for other cool services like ice skate sharpening, shirt printing, and engraving. Plus, if you're looking to offload some gear, Decathlon offers buy-back vouchers for your used sporting equipment. Get a quote online and swing by their Stockport store at SK4 1DN, or give them a ring at 0161 476 9600.
