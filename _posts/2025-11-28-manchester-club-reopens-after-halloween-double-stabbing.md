Nowhere Club in Manchester is back in action after a temporary closure following a double stabbing on Halloween during a Mason Collective event. The club’s licence was paused after the incident, where two men were stabbed—one in the chest and the other in the neck—but thankfully, their injuries aren't life-threatening. After the town hall licensing hearing, the club was allowed to reopen with extra security measures in place, including metal detectors and body searches. Concerns were raised over the venue's safety, especially since a similar incident occurred at a previous event in Salford. However, security staff have been praised for their quick response. The club's management, represented by Rebecca Lowe from Kuits Solicitors, argued that the incident was an isolated event caused by a few troublemakers, despite existing security measures. To boost safety, they've agreed to enhance staffing and install additional CCTV. The club kicked off its reopening with an event on November 28.
