Andy Burnham's unveiled a grand plan to reboot Greater Manchester’s economy, focusing on five key areas tied to specific industries. Speaking in London, he highlighted how the city centre has evolved, but boroughs need clarity on job opportunities. His ‘Manchesterism’ initiative identifies growth clusters aimed at pushing the local economy beyond £100bn. The city centre will host the ‘digital, cyber, and AI’ cluster, with life sciences centred around Oxford Road, and MediaCity focusing on creative industries. Emerging clusters include a low carbon area in Carrington and advanced manufacturing in Atom Valley. Burnham's confident that these clusters will generate thousands of homes and jobs, with substantial economic benefits. Construction is already underway in some areas, like the digital cluster and life sciences, while others, like Atom Valley, are just starting. He believes this approach diverges from past Westminster strategies that failed to bridge the north-south divide. Burnham sees ‘Manchesterism’ as a modern response to the outdated centralised power dynamics of the past.
