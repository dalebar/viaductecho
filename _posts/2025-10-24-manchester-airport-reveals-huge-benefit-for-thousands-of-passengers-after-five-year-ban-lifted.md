Manchester Airport's in for a treat as Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) resumes direct flights from Islamabad after a five-year hiatus. The first flight touches down on Saturday, marking a big deal for thousands of passengers who’ve faced lengthy travel times and costs. This comeback comes after the UK Civil Aviation Authority lifted a safety ban on PIA, thanks to their rigorous reforms in aviation safety, including pilot licensing and aircraft maintenance.

PIA’s Chief Executive, Muhammad Amir Hayat, expressed pride in restoring this vital route, which not only enhances cultural and economic ties between Pakistan and the UK but also promises a reliable service from Manchester. Initial plans include four weekly flights, with more routes from Birmingham and London likely to follow based on demand.

With fares starting at £633 and a flight time of under eight hours, it’s great news for the 350,000 passengers from the region travelling to Pakistan every year. Manchester Airport is buzzing at the news, adding this route to its extensive network.
