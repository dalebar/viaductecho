The police are ramping up efforts against anti-social behaviour and shoplifting this festive season with their 'Winter of Action' campaign. From 1-7 December, they've made nine arrests and logged 250 hours of visible patrols, contributing to a 20% drop in crime compared to last year. Inspector Jason Holmwood highlighted the collaboration with local partners to tackle crime in areas highlighted by the community. Expect to see more officers out and about, addressing anti-social behaviour and keeping the night-time economy safe as the festive period unfolds. This effort is part of the broader Operation Rimini, which has led to over 85 arrests and the seizure of £120,000 worth of illegal vapes since its launch in 2023.
