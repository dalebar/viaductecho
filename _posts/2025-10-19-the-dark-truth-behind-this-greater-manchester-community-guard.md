A founder of Heywood Community Guard (HCG), a group patrolling outside schools in Greater Manchester, has a violent past, having been jailed for a racist attack in 2022. Adam Farrell left a man with serious brain injuries and made racist statements during his arrest. The group claims to promote safety in response to concerns about asylum seekers. However, leaked messages from their WhatsApp group reveal discriminatory language and discussions about violence. Community members feel intimidated and describe the group as vigilantes, with local schools urging parents not to engage with them. HCG emerged after an anti-immigration protest led by Farrell, and its activities have faced public backlash. Manchester Police stated they do not support HCG but will address any reported issues. Despite the controversy, HCG has received some political support, although criticism for their actions has increased. A GoFundMe page for the group was shut down due to complaints about its content.
