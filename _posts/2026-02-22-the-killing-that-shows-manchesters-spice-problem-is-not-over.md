The tragic case of Kailem Gibson highlights the ongoing struggle with Spice, a synthetic cannabinoid affecting Manchester's vulnerable homeless population. The incident, involving Martin Davies—a dealer and former landscape gardener—occurred just after Davies had brought Kailem and his girlfriend Alexandra into his flat, expecting them to contribute their benefits in exchange for shelter. Their situation soured when Kailem and Alexandra decided to stop handing over their money. In a fit of rage, Davies stabbed Kailem 15 times after a tense confrontation, leading to Kailem's death. Despite claiming self-defence, Davies was found guilty of manslaughter. Kailem's loved ones describe him as a deeply cherished figure, whose legacy of kindness and care will endure. Davies awaits sentencing next month, but the impact of Spice on the city's homeless continues to be a pressing concern.
