Fifty-eight individuals in Manchester hospitals face potential deportation due to recent UK immigration rule changes that raised the salary threshold for skilled work jobs to £25,000, a figure just above the highest earnings of some NHS staff. This fallout affects crucial roles like emergency care assistants and dental nurses, potentially harming an NHS already struggling with waiting lists. Demonstrators voiced concerns at a Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust meeting, urging leaders to secure the jobs of those affected. The trust's chief people officer acknowledged the emotional toll on staff, emphasising their vital role in patient care, while providing updates on the situation. Currently, some staff have secured indefinite leave to remain, while 58 are still awaiting decisions. The looming government changes threaten to extend the wait for permanent residency from five to ten years for many visa holders. Trust leaders are actively seeking solutions within legal frameworks, as they grapple with balancing pay structures and immigration rules impacting their essential workforce. The government aims to shift focus towards domestic recruitment to reduce dependency on international workers while vowing to address exploitation in the care sector.
