Residents in Stockport are worried about potential traffic chaos if 106 new homes are built off Dialstone Lane, proposed by Story Homes and Stockport Grammar School. While the plans aim to create a ‘green gateway’ with half of the homes being affordable, locals fear this could drive up house prices and worsen traffic on the busy road, especially given its proximity to the A6 and Stepping Hill Hospital.

Some residents, like Nathan Lawson, feel that while there's a need for housing, affordable options are limited, with many homes expected to cost over £400,000. Others, like 86-year-old Sheila Hulme, suggest that the land could be better used as a public park. Despite these concerns, planning reports indicate that the development wouldn't significantly impact road congestion, and Story Homes aims to promote public transport and active travel in the area. Residents from nearby Brooklyn Road expressed discontent over the development's design and how their feedback has been addressed. A decision from Stockport Council is expected by April 29.
