In Longsight, the atmosphere was buzzing as politicos and supporters gathered at the Jain Community Centre for Labour's big reveal about their candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election. Following the intrigue around Andy Burnham's blocked bid, the choice came down to Eamonn O'Brien and Angeliki Stogia, the latter eventually receiving the nod amidst a flurry of excitement. Stogia, a Mancunian and local councillor, addressed the crowd, stressing unity and the importance of the local fight against Reform's divisive politics. 

Labour's Deputy Leader, Lucy Powell, echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for community support to keep Reform at bay. Stogia expressed her enthusiasm for the campaign, emphasising the significance of every vote while aiming to reconnect with residents. Meanwhile, Reform candidate Matt Goodwin and the Green Party were also gearing up for the electoral battle, highlighting the competitive nature of the upcoming by-election. The energy among Labour supporters suggests they are ready for a robust campaign ahead.
