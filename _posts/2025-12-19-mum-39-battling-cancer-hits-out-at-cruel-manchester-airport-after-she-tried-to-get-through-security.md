Kelly Grigg, a 39-year-old mum from Cornwall, faced a distressing experience at Manchester Airport after her stoma bag triggered an alarm. Diagnosed with T4 bowel cancer just weeks prior, she felt humiliated by airport staff who mistook a mint in her stoma bag for a drug, treating her harshly in front of her young daughters. Manchester Airport later apologised, acknowledging their service standards fell short. 

After waking up with severe stomach pain, Kelly learned she had a tumour on her sigmoid colon, leading to surgery and chemotherapy. The diagnosis of cancer was a heavy blow, especially as her daughters struggled to understand the situation. Despite the challenges, including the news of cancer spreading to her ovaries, Kelly remains positive and is raising funds for Bowel Cancer UK through a sponsored cycle with friends. They've already raised £4,600, showcasing the community's support. Kelly hopes her experience raises awareness about bowel cancer, especially since her only symptom was that initial stomach pain.
