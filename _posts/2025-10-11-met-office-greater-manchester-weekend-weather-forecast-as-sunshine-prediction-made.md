This weekend in Greater Manchester looks pretty dry and mild! Saturday's off to a cloudy start, but sunny spells are popping up, with temperatures hitting around 16Câ€”nice and warm for October. Winds are light too! The Met Office predicts a clear evening but expect it to chill overnight, dropping to about 9C with some mist likely forming. Sunday should follow suit, starting off a bit foggy before sunny spells break through again, with temperatures also around 16C. Nights will be clear, but Monday morning may turn overcast. Temperatures could reach 17C during the day, and it seems the mild, overcast weather will stick around for much of the week, with a mix of sunny spells and temperatures in the mid-to-low teens. Enjoy the lovely weekend!
