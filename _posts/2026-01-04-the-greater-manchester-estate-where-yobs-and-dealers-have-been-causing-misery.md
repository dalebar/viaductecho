A police chief in Stockport aims to rebuild trust in Brinnington, an area facing problems with yobs and drug dealers. Greater Manchester Police launched an intensive operation starting November 10, deploying various officers to tackle criminal activities. This resulted in 21 arrests for issues like drug possession and driving offences, alongside the seizure of drugs, weapons, and significant amounts of cash. Residents have long complained about anti-social behaviour and have called for more police presence. Chief Inspector John Picton emphasised the importance of community engagement to address these problems, noting the historical lack of communication between locals and police. He believes that crime isn’t necessarily worse in Brinnington compared to other parts of Stockport; however, the community's reluctance to report crimes hampers efforts. With initiatives like surveys and door-to-door outreach, Picton hopes to encourage locals to share information, thereby improving safety and trust in the police. He acknowledged that building this relationship will take time but remains hopeful that the recent police presence will yield positive responses from the community.
