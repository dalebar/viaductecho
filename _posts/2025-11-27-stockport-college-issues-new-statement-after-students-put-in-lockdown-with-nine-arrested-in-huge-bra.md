Nine teenagers have been arrested over a brawl at Stockport College that forced a lockdown for about an hour. Mobile footage showed students engaging in a chaotic fight, starting with two boys and escalating as more joined in. Security staff struggled to manage the situation, with some students jumping barriers to join the fray. Greater Manchester Police responded to the incident around noon, clarifying that while there were initial reports of a stabbing, no weapons were used, and thankfully, no serious injuries were reported. The college implemented a lockdown procedure promptly, prioritising the safety and welfare of students. Principal Carmen Gonzalez-Eslava assured that normal classes resumed swiftly after the incident, emphasising that it involved a very small number of students. Concerns from parents highlighted the shock felt by students witnessing the chaos. The arrested teens, aged 16 to 18, are still in custody for questioning as local authorities continue to support affected individuals.
