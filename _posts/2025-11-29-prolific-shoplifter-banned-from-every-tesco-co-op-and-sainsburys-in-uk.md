Christopher Moran, a 57-year-old known for persistent shoplifting, has been banned from all Tesco, Co-op, Sainsburys, B&M, TK Maxx, Iceland, Booths, and Trespass locations across the UK. After pleading guilty to 10 theft charges at Preston Magistrates Court, he received a 12-week jail sentence and a five-year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) that restricts him from several areas in Preston and Penwortham until 2030. With no fixed address and already serving a 52-week sentence for other offences, he's been labelled a 'prolific shoplifter' by the police. The CBO aims to curb repeat offending and is part of Operation Vulture, a campaign by local forces to tackle shoplifting in Lancashire.
