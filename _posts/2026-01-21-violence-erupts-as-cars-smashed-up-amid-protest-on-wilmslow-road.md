Last night, a protest turned violent on Wilmslow Road, aka the Curry Mile, in south Manchester. The unrest arose over the conflict between Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Around 9pm, a crowd gathered, resulting in chaotic scenes where cars had their windows smashed and attendees clashed amid shouts. Some protesters, adorned with flags, were seen scuffling, and many were pushing against police officers who arrived to control the situation. Officers set up a riot van to block the road, halting traffic and diverting buses away from the area. The exact number of arrests, if any, hasn't been confirmed yet, and Greater Manchester Police are looking into the incident.
