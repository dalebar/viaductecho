This Christmas Eve, airports in the UK, especially Manchester Airport, will be buzzing with activity. Over 85 flights are set to leave Manchester, with around 35,000 passengers expected. Dubai is the hot spot for Christmas Day, attracting over 1,500 travellers. This festive season is shaping up to be the busiest ever for the airport, with over 1.5 million passengers from December 19 to January 4. The UK Civil Aviation Authority is reminding folks to pack smartly—unwrap gifts and check airline rules, as items like snow globes are considered liquids. It's also vital to keep an eye on flight statuses, as changes can happen due to weather or staffing issues. Some flights have already faced delays and cancellations, so staying updated is key. Safe travels, everyone!
