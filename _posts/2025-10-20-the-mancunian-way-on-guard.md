In Heywood, residents have been unsettled by the emergence of the Heywood Community Guard (HCG), a group of men in high-viz vests claiming to protect women and children. The local schools have warned parents against engaging with them, stating they lack support from the council or Greater Manchester Police (GMP). Concerns have been raised about the groupâ€™s vigilante nature and the troubling background of its founders, Jamie Thomason and Adam Farrell, the latter having a history of violent, racist behaviour. An investigation uncovered racist WhatsApp messages shared among members, indicating a toxic atmosphere within the group. Despite some support from the local Reform party, recent town hall meetings have condemned HCG's actions and language. Thomason maintains that his intentions are good, calling the group a necessary response to perceived threats in the community. The situation continues to develop, reflecting increasing tension over community safety and identity.
