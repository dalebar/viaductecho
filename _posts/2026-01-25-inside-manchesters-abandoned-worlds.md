Urban exploring, or urbex, has gained traction over the last decade thanks to social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok. This trend allows folks to peek inside abandoned sites that many wouldn't dare to visit themselves, like old hospitals and manor houses. However, most explorations involve trespassing on private properties, which has its risks. A Manchester trio, known as Project X, has been exploring for five months, sharing their finds online racking up thousands of views.

They follow strict "golden rules": no taking or vandalising anything, and only entering through open access points. Their explorations include a derelict church, an old hotel, and even the Camelot theme park, with one recent video featuring an abandoned gym. The group, all with day jobs, finds it fascinating how these spaces feel "frozen in time." While their families support their hobby, they remind them to be careful. Ellis encourages anyone interested in urbex to prioritise safety and respect the sites they explore.
