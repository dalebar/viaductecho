The Independent Monitoring Board's report on HMP Buckley Hall in Rochdale highlights some serious plumbing issues that have left inmates washing their socks and underwear in mop buckets. The prison, described as 'tired' and in desperate need of repairs, struggles with malfunctioning laundry equipment, inconsistent toilet functionality, and unreliable shower temperatures. Staff shortages are exacerbating the situation, leading to restricted regimes and disgruntled inmates. Despite some improvements, including a more settled atmosphere and various engaging social activities—like coffee mornings, cultural events, and sports—serious concerns remain. The report noted three deaths, incidents of self-harm, and ongoing drug issues. However, it also commended the staff's efforts to engage positively with inmates. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson has acknowledged the crisis and outlined plans for significant renovations and enhanced safety measures at Buckley Hall.
