Andy Burnham has been blocked from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election by Labour's National Executive Committee, chaired by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. The decision came after a clear majority against his application, aimed at preventing an unnecessary mayoral election that could strain party resources ahead of local elections. Labour's statement emphasised the importance of maintaining control over Greater Manchester and that taxpayer money should be spent on addressing the cost of living crisis instead. Burnham will remain as Greater Manchester Mayor until at least 2028, with the by-election triggered by MP Andrew Gwynne's resignation expected on May 7, 2026. The decision has stirred discontent among Labour members, with some calling for a reconsideration and advocating that local members should have the final say on nominations. Critics within the party expressed disappointment, suggesting the leadership is prioritising factional interests over the party's electoral prospects. Meanwhile, some MPs, like Phil Bricknell, warned that such speculation could distract from the party’s wider objectives.
