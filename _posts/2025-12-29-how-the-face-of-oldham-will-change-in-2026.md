Oldham is in the midst of significant change, with major developments underway that promise to reshape the borough. Although some high-profile projects have faced delays, like the Coliseum theatre and new market space, others are progressing well. Notable plans include 331 new homes at Prince’s Gate, supported by a £31.5 million investment, and two large warehousing projects anticipated to create around 1,000 jobs by 2026. The SportsTown project at Boundary Park aims to create a multi-sport tourist attraction, with improvements in the area already underway.

Green spaces are also expanding, with Tommyfield Park set to enhance the town centre, and Northern Roots urban farm progressing in Alexandra Park. Meanwhile, the Coliseum's reopening has been postponed due to construction challenges, but there are hopes for a 2026 launch. Lastly, two major warehouse projects are on track to bring nearly 1,000 jobs by 2026, further signalling Oldham's growth and transformation. Exciting times ahead for the borough!
