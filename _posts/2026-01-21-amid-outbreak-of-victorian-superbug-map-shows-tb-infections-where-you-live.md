A new map highlights areas in Greater Manchester hit hard by a Victorian-era superbug, tuberculosis (TB), prompting the GMB union to call for the closure of an Amazon warehouse after cases were reported there. With TB cases rising across England—including Manchester, which has the highest local rate—authorities took action by testing workers at Amazon’s Coventry site. The increase in TB notifications, now at 5,490 in England for 2024, has raised concerns, especially since four council areas in Greater Manchester surpass the World Health Organisation's low-incidence threshold. Amazon confirmed a few employees tested positive last year, but reported they have since recovered and are no longer infectious. The company is following health guidelines and maintains that the risk to the public is low. Meanwhile, the GMB union stresses urgent measures are necessary to protect worker and community health. TB remains a significant health issue globally, particularly among vulnerable populations and urban areas.
