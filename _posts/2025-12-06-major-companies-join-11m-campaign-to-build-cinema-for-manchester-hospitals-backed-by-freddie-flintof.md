The Manchester MediCinema Appeal, backed by Freddie Flintoff and several major companies, aims to raise £1.1m to build a cinema at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) for hospitalised patients. This initiative will also benefit the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital (RMCH), providing a much-needed distraction and comfort for those facing long hospital stays. Flintoff described it as a 'Christmas present for Manchester', highlighting how the cinema will allow patients to enjoy films with their families, creating cherished memories during tough times. The appeal is rallying local businesses to contribute and has already garnered support from various organisations, including The Manero Cinema Group and Lipton. Donations can be made easily via text or through the Manchester Foundation Trust Charity's website. The aim is to reach the target by Christmas, with each contribution helping to transform hospital experiences for many patients.
