Christmas in Greater Manchester is a magical time, especially for families welcoming new babies. NHS teams, including doctors and midwives, are hard at work while others are winding down for the festive season. This year, the first baby born on Christmas Day was little Elyanna at St Mary's Hospital, arriving at 12.22am and weighing nearly 7lb 13oz. Proud parents Weeam Salah Elbeera and Mouayed Boker from Prestwich are thrilled. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust even shared a sweet photo of her in her first hours. If you've welcomed a new arrival this Christmas in Greater Manchester, they’d love to hear from you!
