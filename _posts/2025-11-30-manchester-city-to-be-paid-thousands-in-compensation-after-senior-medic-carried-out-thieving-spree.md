David McNally, a former paramedic with over 20 years of service, has been ordered to pay Manchester City £24,676.35 in compensation after stealing items from the Etihad Stadium over four years. Nicknamed as a casual matchday medic, McNally swiped football gear, medical supplies, and branded kits, selling them on eBay. His actions, labelled ‘breathtakingly brazen’ by a judge, led to a suspended prison sentence. McNally's thefts, totalling £75,000, included high-value items like signed shirts and personalised boots from Sergio Aguero. The club launched an internal investigation after catching him on CCTV, leading police to find 108 stolen items at his home. Court proceedings highlighted McNally's remorse for his actions, which he claimed were initially trivial thefts to supplement his income. He received a 10-month suspended prison sentence, 250 hours of community service, and was placed under curfew. The judge remarked on the waste of McNally’s promising career for a bit of extra cash, underscoring the disgrace brought upon him and his family.
