Greater Manchester residents are bracing for council tax hikes as budgets for 2026/27 are finalised. Manchester is set to raise its council tax by 4.99% despite a £94m boost from the government, while Trafford council will up its tax by 7.49% for the second consecutive year, needing a £20m loan to manage debts. Other councils, such as Bolton and Bury, opt for a 4.99% increase while addressing budget gaps with planned cuts, particularly in social care.

Salford and Stockport also propose a 4.99% tax increase, with Salford promising no cuts. Oldham plans a significant rise in service charges and a parallel council tax hike, as the council grapples with a £20m budget gap. Tameside aims to maintain services without cuts, but may still rely on reserves due to unmet savings goals. Wigan follows suit, suggesting a 4.99% rise amid plans for AI and efficiency measures to fill a £14m shortfall.

Overall, varying financial pressures lead councils to explore different strategies to balance their budgets, with tax rises looming large across the region.
