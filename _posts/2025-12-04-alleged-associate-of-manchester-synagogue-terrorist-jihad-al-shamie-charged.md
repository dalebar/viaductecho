Mohammad Asim Bashir, a 31-year-old from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, has been charged with four terrorism offences following the investigation into the October attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue. He’s set to appear in court on December 5. Bashir is accused of assisting known terrorist Jihad Al-Shamie by driving him to a UK defence facility for hostile reconnaissance, although the exact facility hasn’t been revealed. He’s also charged with sharing extremist material online, including publications like 'The Book of Jihad' and videos promoting terrorism, through a WhatsApp group. While the charges aren’t directly linked to the synagogue attack, they emerged from related police inquiries. Al-Shamie, who attacked worshippers before being shot by police, was linked to Bashir’s alleged offences. Authorities are still investigating the synagogue attack and have urged anyone with information to come forward.
