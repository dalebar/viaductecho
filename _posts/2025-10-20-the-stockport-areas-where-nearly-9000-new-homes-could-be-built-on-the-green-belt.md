Stockport is eyeing green belt land for housing to meet rising targets set by the Labour government, which have almost doubled the required annual build to 1,906 homes. The councilâ€™s draft local plan involves 27 sites, proposing a total of 16,406 new homes, but still leaves a significant shortfall of 15,484. Council leader Mark Roberts, a Lib Dem, feels they are being forced to consider these protected lands against their 'brownfield first' policy. A public consultation on the plan will run from November to December 2025, after scrutiny committee discussions. Key identified sites for development include Compstall Mills, High Lane, and various locations in Heald Green, with proposed new homes ranging from 50 to 1,000 at different sites.
