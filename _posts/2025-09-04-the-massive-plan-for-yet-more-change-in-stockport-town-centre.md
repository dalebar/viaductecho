Big changes are on the way for Stockport town centre thanks to nearly £10m in funding. The cash, coming from the government's City Region Sustainable Transport Settlement, is set to improve Stockport railway station and promote greener travel options around town. Over £4m is designated for better pedestrian connections at the station, including a new shortcut ramp from Thompson Street. Commuters can also expect an enhanced platform and service.

Additionally, about £5.5m will go towards creating key pedestrian and cycle links in the town's west area, coinciding with the £350m Stockport 8 regeneration project; this aims to transform the space near Stockport Viaduct into a sustainable neighbourhood featuring up to 1,300 new homes.

Councillors discussed these transport upgrades recently, highlighting the importance of improving connections between walking, cycling, and vehicle routes while the redevelopment unfolds. Cllr Grace Baynham emphasised the goal of modernising the station into a 21st-century transport hub, crucial for Stockport’s economic growth.
