Stockport is moving ahead with plans to install new Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras at key junctions to tackle road safety issues like yellow box violations and restricted turns. Following the council gaining powers to enforce moving traffic offences last year, they've pinpointed specific trouble spots for enforcement. There'll be five initial locations targeted, including various junctions around Cheadle and Stockport where certain turns are prohibited or weight limits are in place. Before installing the cameras, the council will inform motorists and residents. Any fines collected will be reinvested to cover the scheme's operating costs. Councillor Grace Baynham emphasised that this initiative aligns with efforts to enhance road safety, reduce congestion, and promote reliable journeys while supporting the Greater Manchester Vision Zero ambition of zero casualties on roads. Discussions on the changes are set for next week at Stockport town hall.
