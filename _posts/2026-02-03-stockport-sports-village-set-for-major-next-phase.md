Stockport County Football Club, Stockport Council, and Life Leisure are set to revamp Stockport Sports Village (SSV) with plans kicking off on 1 April. Stockport County will take over the operation, building on the community groundwork laid by Life Leisure since 2012. 

The venue will serve as the home for the Club’s Academy, women’s teams, and football education programme, aiming to become a top-notch development centre in the area. Community and grassroots football will remain a key focus, with plans to enhance these offerings.

However, current gym facilities at SSV will close from 1 April. Life Leisure is ready to assist all affected members in finding alternative fitness options, including expanding services at Life Leisure Romiley and the new Marple Hub opening soon.

This change paves the way for more investment in Life Leisure facilities, supporting both the local community and the growth of Stockport County Football Club. For more details, head over to Stockport County's website.
