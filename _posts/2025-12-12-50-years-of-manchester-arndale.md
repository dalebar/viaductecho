The Arndale Centre in Manchester has been a staple of the city for over 50 years. Located off Market Street, this massive shopping hub has transformed alongside the city itself. Originally constructed between 1971 and 1979, it started out with homes on the roof and an underground bus station. The centre's history includes surviving the impact of the 1996 IRA bombing, which necessitated significant repairs and upgrades. Over time, it has evolved to include 210 shops, a bustling indoor market, and various expansions, including a new food court and flagship stores like Topshop and Next. Its welcoming pedestrianised environment encourages over 40 million visitors yearly. Recent developments have focused on modernisation, with new food and drink spaces emerging. While some features have vanished, such as the flats above and the original bus station, the Arndale Centre continues to adapt and thrive, remaining a key part of Manchester’s retail landscape.
