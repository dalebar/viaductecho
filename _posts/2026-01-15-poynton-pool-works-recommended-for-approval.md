Cheshire East planners and local campaigners are clashing again over proposed safety works at Poynton Pool reservoir, deemed a high-risk area despite no flooding history. The council needs to act due to legal obligations, but campaigners criticise the plans as "flawed," pinpointing threats to numerous trees and labelling the proposal as "wanton environmental vandalism." Even council planners noted the environmental impact would be significant; the plan was deferred to reassess data accuracy and explore alternative solutions suggested by the Friends of Poynton Pool (FoPP). 

On January 16, the application will be reconsidered with some amendments. While the number of trees earmarked for removal has been reduced, controversy lingers over FoPP's alternative proposal. FoPP chair Mike Ellison expressed frustration at the council's refusal to engage in seeking a more eco-friendly solution, urging public support during a protest outside Macclesfield Town Hall. Since the proposal surfaced, nearly 10,000 public objections have been recorded. The upcoming strategic planning board meeting could be pivotal for the project.
