Friezland is a peaceful village in Saddleworth, known for its scenic canals and well-kept gardens. However, it faces a major transport issue, especially for those without cars. Following changes to the 356 bus route, access to public transport has become a struggle, particularly for the elderly and disabled. Locals like Jeff Garner and Dianne Tear highlight how the reduced bus services mean they often miss crucial appointments or face long waits. Many, like Emma Kirkman, have resorted to taxis or lifting friends for errands, expressing a desire for a tram connection to Oldham to ease travel. While some residents still find the bus service adequate, like Maggie Platt, the general consensus is that the current transport situation makes life harder for a significant portion of the community. TfGM has acknowledged the problem, stating theyâ€™re working on smaller buses to navigate the narrow roads better, promising a solution in the coming weeks.
