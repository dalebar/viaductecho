Michael Bradbury, 40, has been sentenced to over three years in prison for a horrifying domestic abuse case in Timperley, Manchester, where he attacked a woman in front of her daughter. The incident, which occurred in November 2023, involved Bradbury forcibly entering the victim's home and assaulting her while her teenage daughter tried to intervene. The daughter struck him in a desperate attempt to protect her mum, and her boyfriend called the police. The victim suffered serious injuries that required hospital treatment, and the attack was captured on CCTV. 

Bradbury was found guilty of controlling and coercive behaviour and harassment with violence. His actions were part of a broader pattern of abuse, and he was ultimately arrested hiding in an attic. The victim shared her heart-wrenching impact statement, detailing how the abuse destroyed her life and affected her children. The police commended her bravery in coming forward, emphasising their commitment to tackling domestic abuse and encouraging others to report such incidents.
