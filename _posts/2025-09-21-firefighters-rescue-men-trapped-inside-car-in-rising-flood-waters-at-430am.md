Hero firefighters rescued three men from a car stuck in rising floodwaters in Swinton, Salford, early Sunday morning around 4.30am. The area faced significant flooding following hours of heavy rain, prompting emergency services to respond swiftly with three fire engines and a specialist unit. Firefighters donned water rescue gear to access the car and successfully brought all three men to safety without any injuries. The road was closed due to flooding, but later on Sunday, water levels began to subside. Salford experienced widespread flooding, including submerged roads and damage to properties, prompting the council to consider using the cityâ€™s flood basins. Thankfully, there were no other serious incidents reported overnight.
