Police nabbed two blokes after busting a cannabis farm in Bolton town centre on December 23. Officers raided a property on Newport Street and discovered the farm, complete with lighting and air filtration gear. They found dodgy electrics, which have been secured now. The Bolton Town Centre Neighbourhood Team shared the news on Facebook, confirming they executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The two suspects, aged 25 and 26, were arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and pinching electricity, and they're currently in custody for questioning.
