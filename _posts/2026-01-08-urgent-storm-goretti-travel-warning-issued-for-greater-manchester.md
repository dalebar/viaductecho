Transport bosses have warned commuters about travel disruptions as Storm Goretti hits today. Ice breaker trams are prepped across the Metrolink network in Greater Manchester, with several train cancellations already in place. The storm brings heavy snow, rain, and strong winds, leading to yellow and amber weather warnings across the UK. A yellow warning for snow is in effect for parts of Greater Manchester, particularly Rochdale, Oldham, Tameside, and Stockport, starting at 5pm today and lasting until tomorrow lunchtime. TfGM advises folks to check travel plans, allow extra time, and consider travelling before 5pm. Disruptions are expected for trams and buses, especially on the Oldham, Rochdale, and Ashton lines. No trains will run on certain routes, but train tickets will be valid on some bus services tonight and tomorrow. TfGM’s Chief Network Officer, Danny Vaughan, has urged everyone to stay informed and thanks staff for their hard work in keeping transport running smoothly during the storm.
