Joshua Lee, a 31-year-old drug dealer, has been sentenced to six years in prison after being arrested by police at a flat on Kestrel Drive, Bury. Officers raided his flat around 6am, discovering drugs worth Â£400, including heroin, crack cocaine, and cannabis, along with mobile phones used for drug dealing. Lee was cautioned but refused to comment during questioning. 

He was charged with multiple drug offences and identified as a key player in local drug supply, linked to the JNR drug line, which had sent over 21,000 messages promoting sales from April to November 2024. In addition to drug charges, Lee was convicted of assault and affray for a violent incident involving a knife on Cheetham Hill Road in November 2022, where he attacked a man waiting for a taxi. The GM Police emphasised their commitment to tackling drug crime and violence, and the importance of community safety.
