This week in Greater Manchester is set to be fairly settled before another cold snap rolls in. Today, expect misty conditions with light showers later on, and temperatures peaking at a mild 10C. Tuesday looks like the best day, bringing bright sunshine and similar highs of 10C. But, from Wednesday to Friday, light showers and overcast skies will keep temps around 9C. By the weekend, though, things are likely to get chillier, with highs only hitting 5C on Sunday, signalling the start of a potential cold snap across the UK. Just weeks after Storm Goretti brought wintry chaos, forecasters are warning of another drop in temperatures towards the end of January, as weather systems clash from different directions.
