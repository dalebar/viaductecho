Readers of the Manchester Evening News are split over Manchester Airport's controversial drop-off and pick-up charges. CEO Chris Woodroofe defended the £5 fee for five minutes, citing it as the cheapest among major UK airports, insisting that it helps manage traffic and encourages eco-friendly travel. The transition to barrierless parking means payment must be made online by midnight the following day, leading to fines for those caught out. Some drivers expressed outrage at being charged for quick drop-offs, with many suggesting a free five-minute window to ease congestion.

While some vowed to avoid the airport due to frustration over fees and confusing signage, others pointed out alternatives like the free drop-off zone with shuttle buses. A few readers acknowledged the system's benefits, suggesting solutions like vehicle registration for automatic payments. Overall, opinion remains divided, reflecting a mix of frustration with the charges and acceptance of the policies.
