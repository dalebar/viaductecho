Three individuals, including two men, James Nolan, 22, and Brendan Nolan, 20, along with a 16-year-old boy (whose identity remains confidential), have been charged with drug-related offences following a raid on Whetstone Hill Lane in Derker, Oldham, on October 7. Greater Manchester Police arrested them for the supply and possession of Class A and B drugs, as well as possession of criminal property. They've been remanded in custody and are set to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court later today. Detective Inspector Lee Newburn from Operation Vulcan encouraged locals to report any issues or information about drug-related activities in the area.
