A tragic two-car crash in Bolton on Sunday resulted in the deaths of four people, and locals are calling it a "tragedy waiting to happen" due to the area's history of frequent accidents. A 61-year-old neighbour expressed concerns about the high speeds and busy nature of the road. The victims included taxi driver Ali in a dark Citroen, along with three teenagers in a red Seat. Greater Manchester Police are investigating the incident further.
