Recent data shows alarming homeless figures in Greater Manchester and the north west, with over 25,000 people affected, including more than 11,000 kids. That's a 15% rise from last year. Manchester tops the list with 9,589 homeless individuals, and the situation is worsening as more families find themselves in temporary housing for nearly three years. Shelter highlights the need for more social homes and a freeze on housing benefits, which are driving many into homelessness.

In response, the government has launched a £3.5bn plan aiming to halve long-term rough sleepers over five years, prevent homelessness from happening, and support people leaving institutions. This includes new duties for public bodies to collaborate on prevention efforts.

Housing Secretary Steve Reed emphasised the importance of turning these ambitious plans into reality, while various stakeholders call for immediate action. There's hope with new funding aimed at improving housing services and support, but tackling homelessness remains a significant challenge as winter approaches.
