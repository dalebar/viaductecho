The new travel hub in Prestwich is almost ready, with a £14m multi-storey car park set to offer 300 parking spaces and cycle storage. It recently marked its ‘topping off’ ceremony, suggesting it could open before the planned July 2026 date. The facility will include 254 regular spaces, 30 electric charging points, 15 disabled bays, and room for 76 bikes, right next to the tram stop, which is expected to benefit commuters greatly. Council leader Eamon O’Brien highlighted its importance for Prestwich’s regeneration, despite some disruption caused by construction, frustrating local businesses like Croma. He acknowledged the impact on trade but stressed that the long-term benefits, including a broader £100m revitalisation plan for the area, would ultimately support local commerce and community development. The overall project includes plans for a village square, market hall, community hub, and new homes, aiming to breathe new life into the town centre.
