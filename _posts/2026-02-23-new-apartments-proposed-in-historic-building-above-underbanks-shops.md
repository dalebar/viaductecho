Plans have been put forward for two new flats in a Grade II listed building in Stockport Underbanks. The apartments would occupy the first and second floors of the historic structure above Greenhouse Books and Valli audiology and optometry, both of which will stay open. Each flat will feature two bedrooms, converting existing office space while showcasing the building's historic charm with a modern twist. They're set to use clay plasters and timber finishes to maintain the building's integrity. The ground floor shops will also get a traditional repaint to blend in with other shopfronts in the area. A decision on this project is expected by 19 March 2026.
