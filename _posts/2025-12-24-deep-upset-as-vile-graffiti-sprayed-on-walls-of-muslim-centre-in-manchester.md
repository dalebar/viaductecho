A charity has expressed its 'deep upset' after hateful graffiti was vandalised onto the British Muslim Heritage Centre (BMHC) in Whalley Range, Manchester. The offensive messages, including an anti-Islamic slur, were reported to Greater Manchester Police, who are taking the matter seriously. Leaders at the BMHC condemned the graffiti as 'hateful and deeply upsetting', but acknowledged the overwhelming support from the community, neighbours, and local authorities in response. They shared gratitude for the swift action from the police and council, emphasising that kindness and solidarity are crucial in fighting hate. The BMHC, which aims to promote understanding and community cohesion, highlighted the strength of the local community in rallying together during this troubling time. The centre serves as a vital cultural hub, celebrating Islam's rich history while fostering connections for Muslims and the wider public alike.
