TransPennine Express has announced the closure of the Manchester to Sheffield line from 6pm on Thursday, January 8, until 0.01am on Saturday, January 10, due to severe snowfall expected from Storm Goretti. The Met Office has issued amber and yellow weather warnings, predicting up to 30cm of snow in certain areas. Passengers on the affected route won’t be able to travel, and those planning to journey across the network should check for possible delays and cancellations. Ticket holders can defer their travel for no extra charge or request a full refund via the TransPennine Express website. Other rail services, including Northern, are also adjusting their schedules with certain lines suspended and no replacement bus services available. Andrew McClements from TransPennine Express emphasised the priority of customer safety and advised travellers to reconsider their plans.
