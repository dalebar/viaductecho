Shahid Ali, a criminal solicitor, has been fined £40,000 after a disciplinary tribunal found he misled the wife of his client, former cricketer Nasir Jamshed, about £15,000 cash he held for him. While Ali was cleared of encouraging Jamshed to give false evidence, he admitted to dishonestly telling the wife the cash was for legal fees, which it wasn't. The tribunal noted he acted out of a 'sincerely held but erroneous belief' that he was supporting his client. Jamshed, who has played for Pakistan over 60 times, was involved in a spot-fixing scandal during a 2017 tournament that came to light via undercover police work. He eventually pled guilty after incriminating evidence was presented in court. As a consequence of his actions, Ali, who previously had an unblemished career, received the hefty fine alongside £30,000 in costs.
