The shooting occurred around 12.15am on Saturday, September 20, on Wayland Road, where armed police found a bullet in the victim's shoe. Detectives are actively searching for the unidentified gunman, who fled the scene. A police cordon was set up around the area near Ryder Brown Pocket Park, and forensic teams were seen collecting evidence.
