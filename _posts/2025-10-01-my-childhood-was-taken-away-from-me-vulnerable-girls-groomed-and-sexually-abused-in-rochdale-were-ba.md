Seven men in Rochdale were sentenced for the grooming and sexual abuse of vulnerable girls, with a judge stating the authorities had "seriously let down" the victims. During the trial, the girls, identified as Girl A and Girl B, bravely recounted their traumatic experiences, facing intense questioning about their ordeals. Judge Jonathan Seely emphasised the victims' manipulation and the failure of those meant to protect them, noting the deeply troubling backgrounds of both girls. Victim statements voiced the long-lasting emotional impact of the abuse, with Girl A recounting the loss of her childhood and extensive police interviews that have greatly affected her life. Girl B shared her struggles with shame, trust issues, and the repercussions on her children. Both expressed gratitude for the support from the police and the legal team, highlighting the importance of being believed. The sentences aimed to send a strong message about protecting vulnerable children and holding offenders accountable, while the courageous actions of the victims were acknowledged as pivotal in seeking justice.
