Rochdale’s abandoned Turner Brothers asbestos factory, often dubbed ‘Rochdale’s Chernobyl,’ is facing fresh scrutiny as the new owners, Spodden Park Ltd, work on a clean-up amid ongoing concerns about trespassers and asbestos hazards. The derelict 75-acre site, once a bustling hub for local jobs, has a dark past linked to asbestos, a known carcinogen. Despite plans for possible housing developments, scepticism lingers in the community due to past failed proposals and safety fears about asbestos contamination. A consultation is planned for 2026 to discuss future developments, but no firm dates are set. Locals, like John Hainsworth, recall a time when the area was bustling with workers but now view the factory as a dangerous eyesore. Spodden Park Ltd is currently addressing environmental concerns, including invasive species, while assessing necessary remediation before any construction can begin. They express appreciation for the community’s patience as they navigate this complicated project, promising updates and further consultations in the near future.
