Bolton's public parks are set to get a boost in protection, thanks to a partnership with the charity Fields in Trust. With 69 parks in the borough—like the stunning Queens Park and the lovely Moses Gate—the council wants to ensure these green spaces can’t be sold for development. A proposal going to Coun Richard Silvester, the cabinet member for the environment, aims to secure parks for recreational use only. Fields in Trust, which has championed park protection since 1925, will help with legal commitments to keep these areas safe for the community and nature for good. The council plans to identify parks eligible for protection and is eyeing Queens Park as a starting point. This move underscores the vital role parks play in local communities, keeping them accessible for everyone.
