A video claiming to show fans brawling at Old Trafford during Manchester United's FA Cup match against Brighton is making the rounds, racking up over 600,000 views on X (formerly Twitter). The video falsely suggests the incident happened after United's 1-2 defeat on January 11 and incorrectly states the score as 2-0. It features a fight in the stands but has been confirmed by the club as being recorded earlier in the season, likely during a match against Chelsea. United clarified that this altercation wasn't linked to the Brighton game, with fans on social media pointing out the misleading nature of the post. The club also stressed that the situation has been addressed.
