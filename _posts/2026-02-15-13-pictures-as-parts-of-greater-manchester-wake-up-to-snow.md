This morning, areas above Ramsbottom and Bury have woken up to a picturesque snowy scene after a yellow weather warning from the Met Office. The warning, which started at 9pm on Saturday and lasts until 10am Sunday, cautioned about heavy snow potentially disrupting travel, especially over high ground. This follows a lovely sunny Valentine's Day, which was touted as the best day in some time. Although Sunday morning is expected to be mostly dry, heavy rain is on the way from 11.30am, with further showers anticipated throughout the day. Snow accumulations of 1 to 3 cm are likely at lower levels and up to 7 cm on higher ground, with icy conditions posing additional hazards, particularly in the north-east. So, while it's all winter wonderland now, don't forget your brolly later on!
