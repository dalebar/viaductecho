Dan Hepner, the beloved owner of Live Louder guitar shop in Altrincham, passed away two months ago at 51. His family hosted a final tribute event at the shop, allowing friends and customers to celebrate his life. His wife, Ruth, expressed how touched she was by the outpouring of love, while his stepdaughter, Scarlett, highlighted how Dan treated customers like friends. They organised the event as a way to honour him and give people one last chance to buy from his shop. Attendees came from near and far, with one even flying in from Switzerland for guitars. Friends shared fond memories of Dan, describing him as warm and empathetic. The event was emotional but filled with love and remembrance.
