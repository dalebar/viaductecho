Performance poet Lemn Sissay wants his new piece for Manchester City to celebrate Black History Month and be a work that "everybody loves". Having supported the club since he was 13, he aims for the poem to highlight that black history is integral to everyone's history. The piece, which involves the club's backroom staff, has been displayed on stadium screens and ticker tape at recent games. Meanwhile, anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out noted a drop in racism reports across football, although professional reports increased slightly from 223 to 245 in the 2024-25 season.
