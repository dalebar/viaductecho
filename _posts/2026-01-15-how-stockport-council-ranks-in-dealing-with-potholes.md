Local councils in Greater Manchester are getting ratings on how well they handle potholes, thanks to new government transparency reports. These ratings range from green (best) to red (worst) based on road conditions, maintenance spending, and adherence to best practices. Manchester council topped the spending with £25.514 million on road maintenance, while Salford fixed the most potholes at around 18,200. Only Manchester and Wigan scored green ratings; Bolton received a red due to data errors. Nationwide, just 16 councils achieved green ratings, with most falling into amber. The aim of the rating system is to identify where councils can improve rather than to shame them. For long-term funding, councils must keep publishing updates on their road maintenance efforts. Stockport, rated amber, spent £9.02 million to fill about 3,716 potholes and is dedicated to enhancing road conditions, according to their council spokesperson. Local MP Navendu Mishra highlighted the need for government support to improve road quality after years of funding cuts.
