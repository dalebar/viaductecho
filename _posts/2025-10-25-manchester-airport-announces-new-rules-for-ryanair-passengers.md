Manchester Airport has rolled out new rules for Ryanair passengers as part of its £1.3 billion transformation programme. With the new-look Terminal 2 set to serve 70% of passengers, Terminal 1 will soon shut down, allowing for an expansion of Terminal 3. This revamp will add 40% more seating and modern facilities, including a swanky sports bar called Sporting Chance with 469 seats and airfield views. From October 21, Ryanair passengers need to check in at Terminal 1 Departures A, instead of Terminal 3, before moving to Terminal 3's departure lounge, where all shops and eateries remain available. This arrangement will last until Terminal 1’s closure, after which it will be permanently linked to Terminal 3. Staff will be around to help, and arrivals for Ryanair remain unchanged at Terminal 3.
