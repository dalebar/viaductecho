Police in south Manchester have arrested three men, aged 21, 22, and 25, following coordinated raids on six addresses. This action stemmed from a long-term investigation into Class A drug supply, initiated after discovering a property with a significant stash of drugs and cash in Greenheys. The Xcalibur taskforce, alongside other teams, seized several phones, a machete, and various drugs during the raids. The suspects are being held on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A and B drugs. Notably, the 22-year-old faces additional charges related to firearm possession and aggravated burglary in separate cases. Detective Inspector Kat McKeown highlighted the operation as a key part of their commitment to tackling organised crime in the area, expressing satisfaction with the progress made.
