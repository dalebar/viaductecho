An easyJet flight from Manchester to Keflavik, Iceland was diverted back to the airport on Sunday evening due to bad weather that prevented landing. After a two-and-a-half hour journey, the aircraft ended up in Edinburgh before returning to Manchester. The flight was rescheduled for Monday. EasyJet expressed apologies for the disruption, explaining that 'low visibility' at Iceland’s main airport was to blame, stating that the situation was beyond their control. They did their best to support affected customers by providing accommodation and meals.
