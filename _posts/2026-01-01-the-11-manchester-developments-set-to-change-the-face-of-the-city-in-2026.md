Manchester's building boom is set to continue into 2026, with developers investing heavily in the city. Among the highlights will be the opening of the expanded Etihad North Stand, adding 7,000 seats and new facilities, alongside a £60 million genomic research facility in Greenheys. Affordable housing projects like Dovecote House and the Didsbury Point apartments are also on the rise, providing homes for social rent. Meanwhile, Chorlton is set for a transformation with the construction of an over-55s apartment complex and the demolition of the 1970s shopping centre for new housing. Plans are in place for 498 homes at the former Riverpark Trading Estate and ongoing developments around Mayfield Park to create modern office spaces. Wythenshawe will see a £500 million revitalisation, introducing 422 new homes. Areas like Gorton and Moston are next in line for upgrades, with significant investments aimed at community improvements and new housing. Overall, Manchester's skyline and neighbourhoods are poised for an exciting evolution as the city adapts to its growing population.
