Mohammed Imran Ali, a homelessness volunteer and boxing gym director, is vying for a councillor position in Werneth, Oldham, despite his infamous past as a getaway driver for cop killer Dale Cregan. Now that his conviction has expired, Ali is keen to shift public perception and focus on community improvement through his "Make Werneth Great Again" campaign. He’s candid about his past, viewing it as a waste of life and using it to deter young people from making similar mistakes. After serving time, he dedicated himself to community service, addressing local deprivation and disillusionment. Ali critiques the current councillors, claiming they've done little to combat issues affecting Werneth. Competing against long-serving Labour councillor Fida Hussain, Ali insists he offers a real alternative for voters who seek change. Despite his turbulent history, Ali is determined to demonstrate his commitment to the community, advocating for unity and progress rather than dwelling on the past. He feels a strong connection to Werneth, motivated by gratitude for the area’s support when his family arrived from Ireland. As he navigates the political landscape, Ali is ready to challenge the status quo.
