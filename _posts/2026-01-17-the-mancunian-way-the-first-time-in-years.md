Yesterday, Manchester saw something unusual: a developer getting turned down for a planning application. Liquid Funding Business (LFB) proposed a 50-storey tower near Piccadilly, but after a series of debates, councillors raised concerns about its impact on surrounding buildings and the potential loss of natural light for residents at the Oxygen tower. LFB's plans were already pushing the city's development blueprint limits. Coun Sam Wheeler highlighted that the project would incur a £13m loss and violate the strategic regeneration framework by exceeding height limits, failing to promote integration, and lacking affordable housing. Fellow councillor Jon-Connor Lyons noted that LFB didn't consult with him earlier, which could have eased issues. Ultimately, a motion to refuse the application was put forward, emphasising the need for affordable housing over flashy amenities. The committee voted unanimously against the proposal, marking a rare win for local residents in the face of relentless development.
