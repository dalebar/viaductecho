Bolton Council is facing criticism from its own Conservative councillor, David Meehan, after using the town hall's power supply for a vigil commemorating child victims in Gaza. The event, titled 'Know Their Names', had participants reading the names of over 18,000 children who lost their lives in the conflict. Meehan argued that the council prioritised activists over residents and suggested the event contradicted government calls to avoid protests following recent violence in Manchester. While Bolton Council maintained the vigil was not a political protest and was held in response to a pre-arranged request, Meehan expressed concerns about civic neutrality and the use of public resources. He voiced that this situation raises serious questions, calling the event’s facilitation by the council a disgrace. The council emphasised its responsibility to support reasonable public requests, stating the vigil wasn’t political but rather a remembrance event and was relocated to ensure safety due to storm forecasts.
