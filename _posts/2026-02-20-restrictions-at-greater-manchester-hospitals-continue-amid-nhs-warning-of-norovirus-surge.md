The NHS is warning of a potential 'second surge' in norovirus cases, with levels at their highest this winter. Greater Manchester hospitals, particularly Stepping Hill Hospital, have implemented visitor restrictions due to outbreaks in wards. The average number of norovirus patients in hospitals is now over 1,000, marking a significant increase from earlier in the winter. NHS officials are urging the public to practise good hygiene and avoid schools and workplaces if symptomatic. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Bolton Hospital have both limited visits to ensure patient safety, with exceptions for those in end-of-life care or with specific needs. They’re also ramping up cleaning and monitoring efforts to manage the outbreak. The situation is being reviewed regularly to allow for safe visiting when possible.
