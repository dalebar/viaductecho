Will McKenzie, a Stockport lad, is on a massive cycling adventure to Singapore, following the loss of his dad to a brain tumour. Together with his mate Kris Tan, they kicked off their journey on May 5 and have already covered 4,500 miles, navigating through various countries like Germany, Bulgaria, and now Kyrgyzstan. Along the way, they've faced challenges like wild dogs, heat exhaustion, and even bike mishaps, yet they've been uplifted by the kindness of strangers. Will aims to raise £5,000 for Brain Tumour Research and the charity It’s Time, which supports young adults dealing with parental bereavement, a cause he deeply relates to. Despite the difficulties, they’re soaking in the beautiful landscapes and cultures, with a particular excitement for the delicious food awaiting them in Malaysia and the experience of connecting with locals in Singapore. You can follow their epic journey on Instagram @stockport_2_singapore and support their fundraising efforts on JustGiving.
