Will McKenzie, a man from Stockport, is cycling to Singapore to honour his late dad, who passed away from a brain tumour. He embarked on this ambitious journey with his mate Kris Tan on May 5, tackling over 4,500 miles through various countries, including Germany, Kazakhstan, and now Kyrgyzstan. Their trip has been nothing short of wild, facing obstacles like wild dogs, heat exhaustion, and food poisoning, while also being supported by strangers along the way. Will, who started this journey feeling “helpless” after his father’s death, aims to raise £5,000 for Brain Tumour Research and It’s Time, a charity supporting young adults dealing with parental bereavement. The adventure is also a personal challenge for Will to cope with his grief and prove he can achieve something significant. Despite not being seasoned cyclists, the duo is driven and resilient, excited for the next leg through Thailand and Malaysia, where they plan to connect with Kris's family. You can follow their journey on Instagram @stockport_2_singapore and see their fundraising efforts on JustGiving.
