Darcy, a two-year-old, is peacefully napping in her pram while dad Lucas Dawson chats with an old mate over lattes in Manchester’s bustling Stevenson Square. They discuss the changing landscape of the city, recalling the legendary Sankeys nightclub and its transformation into a trendy area favoured by young professionals. Since the late '90s, Manchester has seen substantial redevelopment, attracting investment and new residents, which has sparked conversations about the divide between the old and new Mancunians. While newcomers enjoy the city’s vibrant buzz and opportunities, long-time residents like Julia express feeling disconnected and concerned about safety issues in certain areas. Manchester is steadily growing, with over 5,110 new homes built recently, yet the demand for housing drives costs up, creating challenges for locals. Despite these tensions, council leaders emphasise their commitment to improving the city, balancing its rich heritage with modern developments, ensuring everyone can feel proud of Manchester.
