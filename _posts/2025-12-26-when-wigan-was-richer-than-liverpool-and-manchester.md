Wigan's history is much richer than its famous figures like George Formby or George Orwell's "The Road to Wigan Pier." Members of the Wigan Local History and Heritage Society, Clare Kenyon and Andy Lomax, passionately share the town's past, which dates back over 2,000 years, long before its bigger neighbours, Liverpool and Manchester. They highlight Wigan’s significance as a medieval borough and a vital centre during the Industrial Revolutions. While Orwell’s portrayal focuses heavily on poverty, locals like Clare and Andy feel it lacks balance, missing out on the town's vibrant culture and prosperity in the 1940s. Wigan was a bustling market town, even historically wealthier than Liverpool and Manchester. They point out Wigan's strategic location between these cities and mention ancient Roman remnants that add to its charm. Andy also debunks the ‘pie-eater’ stereotype, explaining it’s rooted in a historical miners' event. Interest in Wigan’s heritage is alive and well, with a popular book on King Street almost sold out. For more on Wigan's history, check out the Local History and Heritage Society's website.
