Archie McCaig, a 63-year-old motorist, has slammed Manchester Airport after being charged £25 for a mere four minutes of picking up his family at Terminal 2. He parked in the barrierless pick-up zone at 8:23 am but ended up stuck in a traffic queue, which led to his bill reflecting a 30-minute stay until 8:53 am. The airport's pricing structure charges £5 for up to five minutes but ramps up for longer stays, with a hefty fine if not paid promptly. Archie is frustrated, noting that the area was congested, likely due to an accident nearby. He voiced his discontent to the Manchester Evening News and called for a refund while threatening to escalate the issue to Mayor Burnham if unresolved. The airport has acknowledged his complaint and stated they’re reviewing the situation. They clarified that the charges are designed to manage access and reduce congestion but also provide a free drop-off option nearby. Archie just wants fairness, insisting he won't shy away from fighting this.
