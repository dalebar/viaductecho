Northern leaders, including mayors from Manchester and Liverpool, are pushing for the Olympic and Paralympic Games to be hosted in the north of England for the first time. They’ve penned a letter to the Secretary of Culture, Media and Sport, requesting government support for a future UK bid centred in the north, arguing it's time for a fairer distribution of major events across the UK. They point out the north's existing infrastructure, like elite sporting venues and transport hubs, as well as its history of successfully hosting major events such as the Commonwealth Games and the Tour de France.

Mayor Andy Burnham highlights how hosting the Games could transform perceptions of the region and spur significant economic growth, as seen after the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The collaboration stresses that a northern bid could catalyse long-term investments in transport, housing, and cultural initiatives. They seek government agreement to embed the Games in the north, work on feasibility, and plan for lasting benefits to northern communities. This initiative is seen as a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape the north's economy and global image.
