A murder investigation is underway after a 55-year-old man died following an altercation in Oldham. Emergency services were called to a property on Plumpton Close in Royton around 7.50 pm on December 6, but sadly, the man was pronounced dead at the scene. A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody for questioning. 

Greater Manchester Police are actively investigating and want to reassure the community that this appears to be an isolated incident, posing no wider threat. They're encouraging anyone with information, or relevant CCTV or doorbell footage from the area, to step forward. Detective Inspector Louise Kelly emphasised the importance of community support in uncovering the circumstances surrounding the man's death.

If you have any information, you can contact GMP online or call 101, quoting log number 2978 of December 6. You can also reach out to Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111. Updates will continue as the investigation progresses.
