The music scene in Manchester came together to celebrate the life of Gary "Mani" Mounfield, the iconic bassist for The Stone Roses, who passed away peacefully at 63. Mourners gathered at Manchester Cathedral, including fellow musicians like Ian Brown and John Squire, who remembered him as a beautiful human and a brother. Other notable attendees included Paul Weller, David Beckham, and various stars from bands like Oasis and Joy Division. 

Many shared heartfelt memories, with Rowetta expressing how Mani had been a tremendous support to her, while Peter Hook called him the smartest person he knew. Others reflected on his deep connection to Manchester and his legacy within the city's music heritage. Mani's death followed the loss of his wife, Imelda, nearly two years earlier after her battle with cancer. Starting with The Stone Roses in '87, he later joined Primal Scream, reuniting with his original band in 2011, much to fans' delight. The outpouring of love and respect at his funeral showcased just how much he meant to friends, collaborators, and fans alike.
