Salford council plans to tackle nuisance parking around Salford Royal Hospital by expanding a parking permit scheme in response to resident requests. The new scheme, expected to launch in summer 2026, will restrict parking during certain hours to permit holders on more streets surrounding the hospital. Currently, the permit scheme already covers areas to the north, east, and west, but with varying times and days. The move aims to ease parking frustrations caused by commuters and nearby schools. The council has initiated the necessary traffic regulation order and identified potential new streets for inclusion. They plan to monitor the scheme's impact and adjust it if necessary.
