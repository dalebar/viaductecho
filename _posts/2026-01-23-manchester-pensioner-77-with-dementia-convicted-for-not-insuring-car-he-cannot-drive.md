A 77-year-old man from Middleton, Greater Manchester, has been convicted for not insuring his car after being diagnosed with severe dementia and stopping driving in December 2024. He faced prosecution in a fast-track court after the DVLA fined him for the uninsured vehicle in August 2025, but he had no memory of receiving the fine. His brother, who is now seeking Power of Attorney, alerted the court about the man’s condition, yet the magistrate accepted a guilty plea entered on his behalf and imposed a six-month conditional discharge instead of a fine. The case has raised concerns about the Single Justice Procedure, which may miss opportunities to withdraw cases that are no longer in the public interest. The government is assessing responses to a consultation on potential changes to this process. Despite the conviction, the DVLA can still request to reopen the case.
