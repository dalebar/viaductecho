A woman was taken to hospital after a hit-and-run incident near Manchester's Gay Village on Minshull Street on January 8. Greater Manchester Police responded to the scene shortly after 6.30pm, and while the woman's injuries are serious, they're not considered life-threatening. No arrests have been made yet as the search for the driver continues, who fled the scene. Police set up a cordon on Minshull Street while they gathered evidence, with debris found on the road. The area has since been cleared and reopened.
