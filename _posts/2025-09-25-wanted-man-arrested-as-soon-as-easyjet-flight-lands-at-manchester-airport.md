A 32-year-old man was removed from an easyJet flight upon landing at Manchester Airport after arriving from Egypt on September 23. The flight, EZY2252, had already faced delays and was diverted to Brindisi, Italy, due to a medical emergency involving another passenger. After landing in Manchester, police were ready to arrest the man, who was wanted for drug supply offences in Bradford. He was taken into custody but was later released under investigation as inquiries continue. Passengers described the journey as a "nightmare," having been stuck on the runway for about two hours. An easyJet spokesperson confirmed the diversion was necessary for the medical situation, emphasising their commitment to passenger safety.
