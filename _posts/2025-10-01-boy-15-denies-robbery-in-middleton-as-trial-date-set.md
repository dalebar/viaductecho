A 15-year-old boy has pleaded not guilty to robbery charges at Manchester Youth Court, related to an incident before the murder of Devon Simmonds-Caines in July. The court hearing discussed trial administration, with a trial date set for March 25, 2026. A case management session is scheduled for December 9 this year. In a separate case, 59-year-old Terrence King has been charged with the murder of Devon, who tragically died in a collision involving an e-bike and a car on July 22. Mr King also pleaded not guilty during his plea hearing, with a trial set for January 20, 2026, and a pre-trial review on December 22. He remains in custody until his next court appearance.
