In April 1974, Piccadilly Radio launched with The Beach Boys' Good Vibrations, amidst the UK's political turmoil and energy shortages. While the station’s studios were being built, young Mike Shaft enjoyed Andy Peebles' soul show across town, later expressing his love for Piccadilly and the sense of community among its staff. The station made a name for itself by covering Manchester's diverse sports scene under the motto "First with News; First with Sport." Many presenters, like Tony Ingham and Liz Bracken, started their careers at Piccadilly, fostering a supportive atmosphere. For more local content, listeners can connect with BBC Radio Manchester on social media or share their story ideas via Whatsapp.
